i have bought several of the vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality the product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better my labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than most . 
this is a confection that has been around a few centuries it is a light , pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts in this case filberts and it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar and it is a tiny mouthful of heaven not too chewy , and very flavorful i highly recommend this yummy treat if you are familiar with the story of c s lewis' the lion , the witch , and the wardrobe this is the treat that seduces edmund into selling out his brother and sisters to the witch . 
great taffy at a great price there was a wide assortment of yummy taffy delivery was very quick if your a taffy lover , this is a deal . 
i got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag the taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors watermelon , root beer , melon , peppermint , grape , etc my only complaint is there was a bit too much red black licorice flavored pieces \( just not my particular favorites \) between me , my kids , and my husband , this lasted only two weeks ! i would recommend this brand of taffy it was a delightful treat . 
this saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy each candy was individually wrapped well none of the candies were stuck together , which did happen in the expensive version , fralinger 's would highly recommend this candy ! i served it at a beach themed party and everyone loved it ! . 
this taffy is so good it is very soft and chewy the flavors are amazing i would definitely recommend you buying it very satisfying ! ! . 
right now i'm mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass they love it i rotate it around with wheatgrass and rye too . 
this is a very healthy dog food good for their digestion also good for small puppies my dog eats her required amount at every feeding . 
i do n't know if it 's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients , but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind ! we picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away ! when we realized that we simply could n't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed br br now , because of the magic of the internet , we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it br br if you love hot sauce i mean really love hot sauce , but do n't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat , grab a bottle of tequila picante gourmet de inclan just realize that once you taste it , you will never want to use any other sauce br br thank you for the personal , incredible service ! .

i was so glad amazon carried these batteries i have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size i need them for my garage door opener br great deal for the price . 
i got this for my mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake , and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake she 's the one with the sweet tooth they both loved these toffees , you would never guess that they 're sugar free and it 's so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free ! i was so impressed that i 've ordered some for myself \( w dark chocolate \) to take to the office so i 'll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets br these are just excellent ! .

this offer is a great price and a great taste , thanks amazon for selling this product br br staral . 
mccann 's instant oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it there is no escaping the fact , however , that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation still , the mccann 's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal it 's even better than the organic , all natural brands i have tried all the varieties in the mccann 's variety pack taste good it can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue br br mccann 's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff one thing i do not like , though , is mccann 's use of thickeners oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy , tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum but this is a convenience product maybe the guar gum is why , after sitting in the bowl a while , the instant mccann 's becomes too thick and gluey . 
this is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand it uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup , so not only does it have a better sweetness , but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you great on a cold morning when you do n't have time to make mccann 's steel cut oats the apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too plus they do n't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart . 
instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl mccann 's instant oatmeal holds its texture , has excellent flavor , and is good for you all at the same time mccann 's regular oat meal is excellent , too , but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning this is the best instant brand i 've ever eaten , and a very close second to the non instant variety br br mccann 's instant irish oatmeal , variety pack of regular , apples cinnamon , and maple brown sugar , 10 count boxes \( pack of 6 \) . 
mccann 's instant irish oatmeal , variety pack of regular , apples cinnamon , and maple brown sugar , 10 count boxes \( pack of 6 \) br br i'm a fan of the mccann 's steel cut oats , so i thought i 'd give the instant variety a try i found it to be a hardy meal , not too sweet , and great for folks like me \( post bariatric surgery \) who need food that is palatable , easily digestible , with fiber but wo n't make you bloat . 
for those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store ! i love mccann 's instant oatmeal all flavors ! ! ! br br thanks , br abby . 
what else do you need to know \? oatmeal , instant \( make it with a half cup of low fat milk and add raisins nuke for 90 seconds \) more expensive than kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something it 's still just oatmeal mmm , convenient ! . 
i was visiting my friend nate the other morning for coffee , he came out of his storage room with \( a packet of mccanns instant irish oatmeal \) he suggested that i try it for my own use , in my stash sometimes nate dose not give you a chance to say no , so i ended up trying the apple and cinn found it to be very tastefull when made with water or powdered milk it goes good with o j and coffee and a slice of toast and your ready to take on the world or the day at least jerry reith . 
i ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter she has this almost every morning and likes all flavors she 's happy , i'm happy ! ! ! br a href http www amazon com gp product b001eo5qw8 mccann's instant irish oatmeal , variety pack of regular , apples cinnamon , and maple brown sugar , 10 count boxes \( pack of 6 \) a . 
the variety packs taste great ! br br i have them every morning at 0 30 cents per meal , i do n't understand why everyone on earth is n't buying this stuff up br br maple and brown sugar is terrific , followed by apples and cinnamon , followed by regular you do n't get tired of the same ole thing , and they taste great br br i just boil water from a small pot , empty the packet or 2 in a bowl , pour in boiling water , and watch it expand to 2x its size ! br br taste really good and takes minutes to prepare br br not sure why everyone on earth is n't this convenient , healthy , very quick , excellent quality , and extremely cheap . 
mccann 's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur , whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour , to the sloth addled instant , which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes it 's all good , that 's for sure , and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular br this variety pack allows different tastes to be explored , as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between mccann 's and other well known oatmeals what i personally like about mccann 's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in america the apples cinnamon , though , tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add in my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty seven seconds , so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use br the only bad thing if you can consider it a bad thing about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you 'll end up with six ten count boxes this is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal eaters , but if you 're a single person alone well , love oatmeal . 
i have mccann 's oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from amazon i am able to save almost 3 00 per box br it is a great product tastes great and very healthy . 
mccann 's oatmeal is a good quality choice our favorite is the apples and cinnamon , but we find that none of these are overly sugary for a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes , this is excellent . 
we really like the mccann 's steel cut oats but find we do n't cook it up too often br this tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient br anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing . 
good oatmeal i like the apple cinnamon the best though i would n't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste that could just be me since i like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of . 
i really like the maple and brown sugar flavor the regular is fine with brown sugar added the apples and cinnamon flavor is ok this is a very quick , easy and satisfying breakfast and i 'll order this brand again , but not the variety i 'll get all maple and brown sugar . 
got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix i bought from the seller , and the advertising worked lol , i tried them , and shared them with 2 buddies , and we all loved them so im here to buy more , and noticed there were no reviews yet , well now there is they are hot , but not burn your mouth forever hot its a nice temp perfect for us . 
this was n't in stock the last time i looked i had to go to the vermont country store in weston to find it along with a jaw harp , cranberry horseradish sauce , fartless black bean salsa , apple cider jelly , newton 's cradle art in motion and the staple vermont maple syrup br br back to the ass kickin peanuts they are hot they will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms it requires a beverage as advertised , a glass of very cold milk , and a box of kleenex since it will make your nose run they look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work i suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence , especially my colleague greg i'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary planters peanuts can , and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when i return br br the can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed it is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes br br you 'll go nuts over these ass kickin' peanuts br br p s i'm not sharing the peanuts , not deliberately , and i 'll probably give greg the jaw harp for christmas he 'll be so insulted . 
i roast at home with a stove top popcorn popper \( but i do it outside , of course \) these beans \( coffee bean direct green mexican altura \) seem to be well suited for this method the first and second cracks are distinct , and i 've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time the aroma is strong and persistent the taste is smooth , velvety , yet lively . 
we roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill \( about 1 3 of the bag at a time \) the smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too more importantly , the coffee is smooth no bitter aftertaste on numerous occasions , we 've had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much . 
deal was awesome ! arrived before halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters i love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store 's candy . 
it is chocolate , what can i say great variety of everything our family loves with a family of six it goes fast here perfect variety kit kat , reeses , take five and more . 
great product , nice combination of chocolates and perfect size ! the bags had plenty , and they were shipped promptly the kids in the neighborhood liked our candies ! . 
halloween is over but , i sent a bag to my daughters class for her share the chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many . 
this bag of candy online is pretty expensive , it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores , other than that , its a good combination of my favorite candy . 
i have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder , not overly tasty , but quite effective , as i never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides same for desert racing in the buggy , the camelbaks were always laced with the powder now we have the fizz what a great product ! firstly , its hammer 's endurolyte product so it 's great , endurance athlete 's the world over use their products second its convenient , handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz third it tastes great ! imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a salty taste , you get a refreshing lemon lime or mango ! the camelbaks always get the fizz now i also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever i exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes i cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough . 
this product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride br i have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor no after taste and i actually like the slight carbonation br i use other hammer products and really like their whole product line . 
this stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides pop 1 into each water bottle and you 're set flavor is fine and goes down easy . 
for those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing br br two years ago i started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat i was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue gatorade was n't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so i looked around for a low carb alternative the zero carb sports drinks did n't help so what to do \? one day i ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them voila ! problem solved ! ! br br i 've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these br br these guys got it right they are superbly formulated and simply work . 
this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds ! my fault . 
these albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality the bears even have little faces at my local candy store this type of gummi stuff \( bears , rings , snakes , balls , worms , whatever \) are about 10 lb these twin packs of 4 5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as i'm concerned i'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things consumed ! . 
grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area in fact pretty much anyone i talk to about grape gummy bears they think i'm lying so i bought 10lbs \) these bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick , but nothing to strong i love grape flavored candy soda and these are pretty good there is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion , but these are well worth it for the price i like to use the gummy bears in home made popsicles with flavored sports drink the salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles , and the gummy bears are awesome frozen they are delicious ! . 
i ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from fantasicakes website for a dinner party i was hosting it arrived fresh and intact very good size i froze half for later use i am a pastry lover and these were the best i 've ever tasted the pastry was soft , the jam was really good and the taste was great they were gone in no time my guests were really impressed . 
these looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix unfortunately , they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate i left them in my pantry for a few days , and when i opened them at room temperature they were still gooey i through them in the fridge and i 've been breaking off hunks ever since they taste good to me , but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again i wo n't order them online again , but if i see them in a store i would pick them up . 
these taste really good i have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture i agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer there is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items order in cold weather and buy enough to last ! ! ! . 
i know i cannot make tea this good granted , i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet it tastes crisp . 
this peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat my dad got me one for christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when i was a little girl i'm 30 now and i love it ! . 
great gift for all ages ! i purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much , they kept them and would not eat them . 
i know the product title says molecular gastronomy , but do n't let that scare you off i have been looking for this for a while now , not for food science , but for something more down to earth i use it to make my own coffee creamer br br i have to have my coffee blonde and sweet but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat , and honestly , i hate to use manufactured food items i really do n't think they are good for the body on the other hand , i hate using cold milk or cream , because i like hot coffee br br i stumbled across this on amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer i also bought low fat \( non instant \) milk powder and regular milk powder the non instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low fat milk , but does not dissolve good in cold water which is not a problem for hot coffee you will have to play with the ratios i would not do just the heavy cream , it made the coffee too rich also , i think the powder is too expensive to just use on it 's own i like mixing 1 3 of each together br br for flavoring , i bough cocoa bean powder , vanilla bean powder , and caster \( superfine \) sugar i mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers if you wanted , you could use a fake sweetner powder instead i make up small amounts that i store in jelly canning jars i also use my little food chopper food processor to blend everything , so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom let it settle for a bit before opening the top though br br this stuff tastes way better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolate orange mix br br all of the ingredients i mentioned are here online take the time to experiment maybe you do n't use any low fat milk or do n't add any flavorings it is up to you also , would make great housewarming host \( ess \) gifts br br i am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it , and i am sure i will experiment with it in cooking but the main reason i bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great . 
we have three dogs and all of them love this food ! we bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him , no more hot spots or tummy problems br i love that it ships right to our door with free shipping . 
my dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food she was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has after we got the test back , we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand so i finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this ! she still has her environmental triggers , but i am happy she can finally eat something i know wo n't cause her pain . 
my shepherd collie mix has ibs our vet recommended a limited ingredient food this has really helped her symptoms and she likes it i will always buy it from amazon it 's 10 cheaper and free shipping ! . 
natural balance dry dog food lamb meal and brown rice recipe did wonders for my jack russell she has awful food allergy 's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that did n't have something in it that she was allergic to she has no problem eating it dry but normally i mix the natural balance dry lamb and brown rice with the natural balance wet lamb and brown rice she seems to like that better we started feeding it to our other dog \( a bichon \) too and she loves it if your dog has allergy 's or stomach issue or if you want your dog to eat better food this is it ! you will see a difference in your pet . 
great food ! i love the idea of one food for all ages breeds t 's a real convenience as well as a really good product my 3 dogs eat less , have almost no gas , their poop is regular and a perfect consistency , what else can a mom ask for ! ! . 
i have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food i have switched them to a different food \( due to price \) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance . 
this is great dog food , my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him . 
this food is great all ages dogs i have a 3 year old and a puppy they are both so soft and hardly ever get sick the food is good especially when you have amazon prime shipping \) . 
my golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs i 've ever met after experimenting with various types of food , i have found she loves natural balance what i really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties i mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it furthermore , i do like mixing up the flavors each time as i think the same meal day over day might get a little boring , so i figured why not i tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells br br additionally , i started purchasing off amazon because petco did n't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans i came home and to my surprise realized that i could save 20 each time i bought dog food if i just buy it off amazon br br all in all , i definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food while i have never eaten it , my dog seems to love it . 
this is the same food we get at pet store but it 's delivered to my door ! and for the same price or slightly less . 
i 've been very pleased with the natural balance dog food our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and i had someone recommend natural balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains since switching i have n't had any issues it is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger smaller sized dogs . 
my 1 1 2 year old basenji jack russell mix loves this dog food he 's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since i switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year despite the higher cost of natural dog foods , i find that he eats significantly less of the natural balance dog foods and still stays happy and full on the normal dog foods , he 'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day \( the recommended serving for his size \) , whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1 1 2 cup of the natural balance dog food a day when you take this into account , you 're actually getting more bang for your buck with the natural dog foods since you do n't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods and a healthier , happier dog , to boot ! add in the fact that you can get free , 2 day shipping with amazon prime i'm sold ! ! . 
our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods the cheap 'you can buy it anywhere' food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets this food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food br this message is ramsey frankenstein approved . 
my english bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3 the vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him \( iams lamb and rice \) and onto a new kind this was the second one we tried , and it has been working ever since it 's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food \( like chicken or beef \) . 
the mouth says , how do i love thee , let me count the ways br if you like apple products a must have item the only draw back , shipping cost these are very heavy . 
arrived slightly thawed my parents would n't accept it however , the company was very helpful and issued a full refund . 
the crust on these tarts are perfect my husband loves these , but i'm not so crazy about them they are just too sour tart for my taste i 'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling my kids think they 're great , so maybe it 's just me . 
these are absolutely scrumptuous ! my husband and i both love them , however , as another customer put it , they are expensive to ship ! the cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are ! . 
what a nice alternative to an apple pie love the fact there was no slicing and dicing easy to prepare i also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed . 
i like creme brulee i loved that these were so easy just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil they look amazing and taste great my guess thought i really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes i will be ordering more ! . 
i first bought pickled asparagus at an amish market and it was love at first bite hence , when i saw these on the discount rack at the local safeway i cleaned it out these are even better than the ones from the amish market they are fantastic , and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom i'm going to order the six pack and i'm a household of one they wont go to waste ! . 
i love asparagus up until very recently , i had never had pickled asparagus oh my goodness , when a friend introduced me to this exact brand , i could n't believe how great stuff tasted i loved it so much i bought the six pack i 've got 2 jars left gonna need more ! ! . 
i'm presently on a diet and i was at my fresh and easy neighborhood grocery looking over possible diet foods i wanted things that were tasty , non fat and low in calories i came home with about a dozen items that 's how i discovered the tillen farms pickled crispy asparagus well , i 've always liked asparagus anyway and i 've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus this tillen farms brand is really , really good ! it 's the best i can recall there 's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which i'm looking forward to eating i ca n't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says only 60 calories per jar ! now this is my idea of a good diet food ! br br gary peterson . 
i have been drinking this tea for a long time now i used to have to purchase it at a doctor 's office because it was n't available elsewhere i'm so glad that i can buy it now from amazon com i drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee wonderful taste . 
i have been drinking royal king 100 natural organic green tea \( 100 tea bags x 2g each \) as my every day tea for several years now i buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping for many years i used to drink coffee from morning till night but finally i realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me i finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together i tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit i found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier \( coffe and other drinks do not \) the only healthier drink is quality cold water in my opinion , for the price , royal king 100 natural organic green tea is one of the best tasting teas this green tea has a beautiful golden color , the taste is bright and fresh i recommend adding a tiny amount of y s organic bee farms raw honey to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too i also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea \( tribute xi hu long jing \) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea \( although i would if i could afford it \) br br cons on my latest shipment the package shown on the amazon page is different than the one shipped the one shipped displays naturally high in polyphenol catechins \( a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea \) , whereas the amazon package displays caffene free so i am not sure if this green tea is caffene free or not the other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when i unwrap the string from around the tea bag so if the string seems stuck to the tea bag i put the bag in the hot water to unstick it . 
this has to be one of the best teas i have ever tasted it 's clean , bright , fresh br br great delivery again quality just try it . 
i love , love this green tea it is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and i usually do n't get as many boxes as i did with this merchant i will definitely order from this seller again ! ! thanks ! ! i depend on my green tea fix everyday ! . 
i love this tea it helps curb my eating during the day my mom and i have given it all friends to try . 
i'm italian and i lived in italy for years i used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an italian espresso i could n't find them anywhere here in the bay area , so it 's great to have them again . 
in the 1980s i spent several summers in italy this biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid day snack they are simple and delicious and were not sold in the us back then they are so good that i brought back two bags from a recent trip to italy it is great to see that they may now be found on amazon ! br br note it is great to open a bag , smell the contents , pour a glass of milk , then dip the macines in the milk great routine and treat for kids ! . 
i had heard a little about this product from the local pet store , then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively the female , younger one took to it right away , and the older male , who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc in it , and would usually refuse a diet change , actually liked it too the older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor 's request , but he totally refused it he is a posh cat after all he still consumes too many calories , the fatty , but at least i know he 's eating good food of course , i know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market , but i just ca n't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there , marketed as being healthy why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal \? is that right \? i 'll stay with this for now , but stay tuned br br i'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats i upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them garfield still eats a little too much , but he 's just a big cat who does n't exercise much , let 's face it our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she 's so healthy she 's tiny , but happy and agile i tried the chicken version of holistic select , but garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one i 've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it . 
i started buying this after i noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his spunk so i decided it was time to start buying him real cat food not the garbage in the super markets i found this at the pet store out of the other million choices , and i'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one i went with to try first and it was a great purchase my cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he 's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft mainly , he loved the taste even more ! i highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals ! . 
i have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat , and this is an excellent food that is also according to my holistic veterinarian they put probiotics on the kibble as the last step , which is very important to me the best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and i had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat holistic select . 
this cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old cleo cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight it stopped her problems she does n't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price it aids in digestion since the ok sorry smells are gone if ya know what i mean had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food . 
i have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections i feed him this dry food in combination with wet food \( with water added to it \) and uri ease the combination seems to keeps his uti 's under control if i switch to another type of dry food , his uti gets worse the other cats seem to enjoy this food as well it 's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me . 
before i was educated about feline nutrition , i allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food i always offered both canned and dry , but wish i would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food i have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats the only good quality dry foods they will eat are wellness and innova innova 's manufacturer was recently purchased by procter gamble i began looking for a replacement after once again offering several samples \( from my local holistic pet store \) holistic select was the only one \( other than the usual wellness and innova \) they would eat for finicky cats , i recommend trying holistic select it is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters . 
my holistic vet recommended this , along with a few other brands we tried them all , but my cats prefer this \( especially the sardine version \) the best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear and \( and i do n't want to be rude , so i 'll say this as delicately as i can \) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the mcdonalds junk found in most stores , which is a definite plus for me ! the health benefits are so obvious i highly recommend holistic select ! . 
one of my cats is allergic to fish and beef this formula is one of the few she can eat , and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet both of my kitties are very active , have soft shiny fur , and neither are fat dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth , also . 
our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food they definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great they are fit and not over weight this vendor ships extremely fast is one of the top amazon suppliers in our book ! . 
i 've been a fan of hot spicy maruchan ramen for a long time if you enjoy spice , and love ramen , you 'll love this product too bad it 's way too expensive here on amazon it 's only 3 36 per 12 at my walmart . 
i 've been eating ramen noodles since i was a little kid , and i 've never found a better flavor than hot spicy chicken ! it is n't hot at all to a chilihead like me , but it sure is good ! . 
always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal , finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in . 
i really loved the spicy flavor these had i found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite if you are n't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough . 
got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup , which is half the price of my local grocery stores , plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors these things are a great snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you ca n't escape for a real meal this is one of my favorite flavors of instant lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale . 
i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon . 
i love this flavor of ramen ! i do n't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison for the convenience of having it delivered to my home \( i have prime , so i get it in two days and do n't have to pay for the shipping \) , the price on amazon is n't bad at all , but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store . 
the best investment i 've ever made for ginger it 's unbelievable ! it 's fibrous like the real ginger , has that spicy kick to it , but it 's perfect with the sugar calms it down it 's very worth the 40 for 5lbs of it ! i 'll be getting more soon i use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies \) . 
delicious i cannot get australian ginger where i live this compares favorably to australian ginger i 've purchased in other cities now i can enjoy it without traveling . 
i keep trying other brands cheaper brands stupid me ! this ginger is soooo worth the money tender , moist and never a let down . 
my son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement , until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and i automatically ordered it for him i was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried what a surprise ! he has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this ginger each morning he can now eat anything and actually enjoy it this product was a god send for him thank you all for it ! . 
i bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on because it 's bite size it 's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick my only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping . 
twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand br if you can get these for 2 to 2 50 a package with free s h it 's a good deal br the black and cherry have good taste but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there . 
i love these very tasty ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! infact , i think i am addicted to them br buying them in packs of 6 bags is very reasonable than going to target and getting a bag savings are about a 1 00 a bag i use subscribe and save on these and several other product i love subscribe and save ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . 
if you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children , then be sure to try these ! they 're soft , easy to chew , and they do n't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car , in the summer , at the beach , etc we love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack ! great item , great price too , highly recommend ! . 
being a fan of newman 's pineapple salsa for quite a while , i was looking for a comparable salsa this is one of the best tasting salsas i 've ever had my daughters love it too they do n't like super chunky salsa and the berry mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces the salsa is not too sweet , just sweet enough and although it 's mild , it has a nice little kick to it at this price , it 's a steal ! . 
this is one of the best salsas that i have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack the other two that come with it are not worth your money . 
this is the best cornmeal i made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding also fried some oysters with this meal , it gave them a great texture and flovor . 
this is a fabulous marinade ! i love to use it for chicken , either baked in the oven or on the grill this has enough flavor flair , i 've even used it for dinner parties , only to receive rave reviews from my guests ! ! definitely worth the price ! super cheap and super easy ! love it ! . 
works with chicken fish beef or pork fast easy and makes it taste excellent plus buying in bulk is more than 50 off from box stores . 
got this for my brother who is on jorge cruise diet and decided to try one for myself it actually tastes pretty good . 
awesome ! ! ! such a yummy flavor i got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and i am so glad that i did there are so many things you can do with jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you i will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful . 
i went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here this jello is wonderful ! evidently it 's only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the fall , i could n't find it anywhere in town this jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe i made with it takes like watermelon jam ! great made as regular jello too yummy ! . 
what a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use this box should last our family the year no problem iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will . 
perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket we love it shakes well , no clumping and flows freely . 
span class tiny length 0 26 mins br br span the expiration date is 21 months from the day i bought this product the tuna , tomato combination is delicious this is one of the many items i re order on amazon every month or so br edit added a short video , so you see what this combination looks like br br i was wearing one of those headlamps , but i did n't do a good job focusing on the tuna br i should film it over , but it does n't look like many people view this product anyway . 
i 've never heard of the safcol brand before but i was tired of only trying the typical pouches starkist and chicken of the sea i was really surprised as i thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning . 
these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion make a great on the go snack , and really satisfying with the tomato . 
i'm not familiar with the safcol brand but being a tuna addict , gave this a shot the tuna tastes like it 's good quality but i found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland it 's better than something plain but it did n't pack the punch i was hoping for it 's still a great option for a low calorie , low fat meal . 
i found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there excellent quality , and no need to 'dress it up' br br i put it the micro on about 20 power for 1 minute and shazam ! br br i believe a little heating brings out the flavor . 
i read about pomegranate molasses so i had to try it ! i have n't made anything with it yet , just eaten a little bit at a time but wow is it decadent ! it 's dark , syrupy , sour , and a little sweet a dab of this and i forget about dessert it 's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone yum ! ! i'm going to try making fesenjan next \) . 
used this in moroccan recipes , as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water wonderful , wonderful stuff ! . 
i purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with jungle theme ! they worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy i purchased 5 if you want more than 25 small bags , i would purchase a larger bag . 
i have drunk ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine i love this stuff in milk br it 's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk i am french and live in the us , br and bring back boxes of ricore at every opportunity savora is another hidden gem you can bring br back check it out . 
i first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in brittany france and thought it was delicious ! i wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that , i love this product ! . 
i could n't wait to try the 8 8243 cinnamon coffee cake because it is made with fresh eggs , creamy sour cream , madagascar bourbon vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel this 8 8243 cinnamon coffee cake is available online for only 18 95 now , i have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes , but , let me just tell you that the fantasicakes cinnamon coffee cake really takes the cake with size , price , quality and taste br the cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition it also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top , before serving i could n't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast , for three days the cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling the flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake the icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor pair the cake with your morning coffee and you 've got the perfect breakfast treat ! . 
i used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 5 6 years ago this stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going it feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong the stronger it is the less you use as well the product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost i thought these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad this is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like . 
one of the best lemon juice that i have tried i am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product when the season for fresh lemos is out , this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments br br i will continue buying it . 
this lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year round it has a powerful flavor and you do n't need much of it to zest up a dish i add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day br br i will buy this product again and again . 
fast delivery and good product this is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it 's really handy to have around to add to sauces , dressings , etc such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it , nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with . 
this is not as good as the frozen lemon juice , but it is good it has a slightly odd flavor , perhaps from a preservative sure wish i could order the frozen juice ! . 
could n't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was seriously , drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime if you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended br br i feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation after a short time my eyes start to get droopy and i am in another place br br love this stuff . 
i bought these at grocery outlet here in the seattle tacoma are for 4 00 a case of tweleve not paying 38 00 yes 3 for a dollar i like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price . 
this is an great product the taste is great , and it works exactly as described superb natural sleep aid amazing ! . 
we made chocolate chip cookies with brm garbanzo bean flour and the results were fantastic ! the brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned our friends could n't discern any difference from classic cccs the texture , body , and elasticity \( meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten free flours \) is nice and chewy the same as cccs made with regular flour and an added bonus the high protein and fiber level \( i calculate 2 3 g fiber cookie \) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower br br i highly recommend this flour even if cccs are the only thing you make with it . 
this is great stuff made some really tasty banana bread good quality and lowest price in town . 
we had trouble finding this locally delivery was fast , no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores . 
this packet of glaze is the secret to making those european style fresh fruit tarts i am about to make one for a pie auction at church , after a friend requested that something strawberry should be offered you can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit tarts by baking a base , layering it with uncooked , fresh , sliced fruit , then pouring over the made up contents of one of these packets they harden up at room temperature , hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart , and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through i 've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes , to hold a fruit topping in place personally , i do not like cheesecake \( too rich for me \) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous , i will admit to do this , slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it 's still in the springform pan pour on the glaze , let it set up and then remove the springform you 'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake cherries , strawberries or sliced mangos are nice , but the best one i ever had used thin slices of lemons , that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake br br i use a base of sponge cake , baked in a shallow form , but other bases can be pate sucre \( a kind of french pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie \) that works well in those fluted , straight sided forms you can also make mini tarts in a muffin pan , pre baking each mold with a layer of pie crust \( even commercial crust works , though again , i prefer pate sucre , it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb \) just blind bake the muffin tins lined with pate , then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits \( berries are great \) and pour over the glaze some people put a layer of creme patisserie , which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour , below the fruit and i happen to think these taste best br br if you get into baking , this glaze is a must have on the shelf the ingredients are vegan tapioca starch , carrageenan , dextrose , cream of tartar , locust bean gum , so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake , you can use this on top , as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base . 
my scotties were full of hot spots and when i used this within a week all the hot spots were gone the smell is kinda strong , but not bad it 's tolerablel . 
i bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants i did n't expect it to taste good , but it actually does ! i 've only had it for a few days and for 5 its totally worth it my sisters all take ganocafe but now i'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee i will follow up on this product in a few weeks \) . 
this coffee is great because it 's all organic ingredients ! no pesticides to worry about , plus it tastes good , and you have the healing effects for ganoderma . 
like the other people mentioned , this coffee has a great taste i 've tried different instant coffees before , but this one is one of the better ones another one of my favorites , if you want to try it out \( though not organic \) , is 'africafe pure instant coffee' . 
tastes great , and gives me energy without the jitters love this product br however , i do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip lock pouch because the zip lock ripped off and quit working after awhile but the product is fantastic , just not crazy about the packaging . 
these little guys are tasty and refreshing br br i usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath i eat 2 of these after lunch \( because they are so small \) and i find this sufficiently resolves the problem br br they 're sugar free \( sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow \) which is great and they 're tasty enough that i almost think of them as part of my lunch br br this is a good bulk value buy and i 'd highly recommend the mints themselves cheers ! . 
i like these better than the regular altoids , but they 're even more costly , so you 'd better like them . 
these little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great deal there perfict for on the go fifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary along and there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugar the price of twelve dollars was very resonable also there great for shareing if you are looking for a mint try these ones youll be glad you did . 
pros br packaging , shipping , price br sold about a year before its expiration date \( enough for me to eat share 9 boxes \) br not too fresh like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form it 's a real mint ! br br cons none ! . 
these mints are really strong and have a great taste they are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse . 
this is a huge supply of them i'm still working on these and have plenty to spare much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 7 11 every time you want a mint . 
i love , and use the empty containers for medicine advil in my purse , desk , suitcase also line with felt to keep earrings perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and love the mints tiny and powerful without burning my mouth . 
received as shown my mother in law likes these and walgreens quit carrying them it was great i could get them on amazon . 
i keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet when i find someone who keeps coming back for more i just give them their own tin ! one co worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes like i said , theyre a real hit since i would n't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish , this is a good alternative to have around and it 's nice to have them around if i have garlic for lunch ! i gave the item 4 stars because they are n't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints but what sugar free item is as good as it 's full sugar counterpart \? \) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove \( although i totally get why they wrap it it still does n't make it easy to deal with \) . 
the tiny altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability it 's full , but compact br br i have n't run out yet , and probably wo n't for a couple months , but i ca n't wait to buy it again . 
i loved these wintergreen altoid smalls so much , i had to come write a review the packaging is small for convenience , and the altoids are smaller as well with a square shape , blue hue , and even more delicious taste in my opinion i definitely prefer them over the regular size altoids and will continue purchasing them ! highly recommended ! . 
fresh scent and taste easy to eat one tin in few hours i use them as favors and everyone loved them . 
hard to find the wintergreen smalls sugar free as stores only have the red smalls peppermint such a common flavor the wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious driving cross country , if someone cuts me off , i turn to my daughter with my hand out and say wintergreen me ! she pulls one out , puts it in my hand , and all is right with the world . 
we have fed our cats a lot of stuff these 2 boy cats are not picky eaters they loved the purina they loved the nutro they loved the iams they love whatever we feed them br br this review is based on what we , their affectionate owners love after a certain age , we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods and lower carb foods , because the catties were fatties we tried a few types of food some evinced no change some made the litter super stink some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they did n't have to chew it to swallow it br br this felidae has done the trick no problems to speak of it is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose the cats love it the kibble is sized appropriate to chewing and here 's the kicker br after feeding the cats felidae , their demeanor improved their coats are super soft and lush both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food we 're now loyal felidae consumers br br additionally , the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat allergies . 
i started my cat on felidae platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it she 's an older cat , somewhat overweight , and had a grouchy temperament i first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which she ate the felidae and left the old food ! she 's now been on just the felidae for about ten days now , off the old food entirely , and she is a much sweeter , happier cat i think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested , or something in any case , i am a happy purchaser of felidae i do n't agree with the previous reviewer that cats do n't like it clearly , mine does . 
we have three cats , the youngest is about eleven years old , another is fifteen and our oldest is , well ancient that is what the vet told us ten years ago the youngest is a blob when he lays down , he looks like a footstool the other two are arthritic and skinny br br since we had such success with canidae platinum for senior dogs , i figured that we 'd give it a try for our cats i 'd had them on low ash purina one urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no ut problems br br buster , the youngest , is still a blob after six months plus on felidae for senior and overweight cats however , the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really feeling better since we changed their food to felidae even prissy , the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her , where before when she was on purina one , all she wanted to do was to sleep br br i think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems , it 'll be more effective br br however , the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life . 
do n't buy just a few of these ! i order these by the case i ca n't even remember the first time i tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but i have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite . 
i order these olives a lot they are un like any other olives out there the subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses one of my favorite appetizer treats for guests . 
a friend who 'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago even took me over to the store and bought me a pound at 7 lb in a retail store or a little over 9 with shipping from an online merchant , i think it 's great i 've been drinking earl grey , english breakfast , irish breakfast , lapsang souchong , assam , etc most of them were over 30 lb with shipping aside from the lapsang souchong , i think this is a great replacement for all the rest has everything i'm looking for in a strong , full bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring my current favorite afternoon tea unless you 're extremely jaded or a tea snob , you 'll love it . 
i love strong , full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam , irish breakfast or early grey tea , but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging so i have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that was n't bitter at a more palatable price point , and this certainly fits the bill and unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another , i e iced vs hot , this tea is excellent in both forms i would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that does n't cost an arm and leg . 
i drink this tea plain \( without sugar or milk \) , and it has a pleasant aroma br br the price from amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store one reviewer is right , i think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma so the label imperial blend kind of implied the herb br br i am not exactly a black tea drinker , so this tea is a surprise , and affordable too i usually prefer white chinese tea , like white peony , but it is more expensive , and requires lower temperature water but this is black tea , and this aroma kind of remind me the 'softness' of white tea . 
i 've tried a variety of ahmad tea not because i particularly like this brand , but they are just easier to come across the imperial blend , i believe , is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones i 've tried it 's full body like a good cup of assam , which by no means overpower the delightful , clean taste of darjeerling , complete with a long lasting note of bergamot i enjoy it best in the evening it gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day br br for those interested in the specifics i use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug , let it steep in 208f water for 2 3 min , take the infuser out , and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication . 
i have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the russian custom of preparing and drinking tea , and the ahmad imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced i buy the three packs as needed from amazon and go through them rapidly my family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too , try one box of it and you will love it too . 
this is an excellent tea one of the best i have ever had it is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar . 
makes a tasty , super easy meal , fast but high in calories br br the instructions say to saute the veggies first but i recommend cooking the chicken first the chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess i made it with snow peas and carrots only i dont like the little corn added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice it came out wonderful ! dinner on the table in less than 30mins . 
i think i have tried just about every bloody mary mixer on the market at one time or the other most have too much sugar or worst , corn syrup this mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty it does have a little kick enjoy . 
might be a little spicy for some , but this stuff rocks i use 1 2 and1 2 with v8 for a milder version , or the best is a bloody caesar ! br half mix , half clamato ! . 
took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste but now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand . 
i started drinking the power slim tea when i was on the hcg diet to help curb cravings since i liked it so well , i tried some of the others and i am now hooked ! they are so satisfying that i drink them all the time the energy gives you that extra pick me up in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day , no matter how long . 
i'm trying several of the wu yi teas i like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste it also has a natural sweetness br br the ingredients include organic wu li cliff oolong tea \( 700 mg \) , organic black tea \( 600 mg \) , organic green tea extract \( 100 mg \) , proprietary blend \( 600 mg \) , plus some ginseng \( panax \) , orange peel , lemon grass , and guarana other ingredients natual orange and citrus flavors br br my goal is to drink more tea and less coffee i am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day i 'll be coming back to this one . 
i cannot live without this citron falksalt , it is wonderful on watermelon , fish , almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does just try it on red juicy watermelon , wonderful experience . 
these things are huge ! i love the way the crystals crunch , and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle this lemony flavor is my favorite it 's good on almost everything you 'll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this . 
this is the ultimate puppy food the kibbles are great for small breeds high in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use less waste results from the high quality ingredients i have been hunting , training , showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years , with multiple national champions i have been highly satisfied with eukanuba 's quality and the results i have obtained feeding their foods my recent purchases are with wag , through amazon com their prices are the best i have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock . 
the recommendation when we bought our puppies \( lhasa bichon mix and lhasa poodle mix \) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned this is a somewhat expensive food so i ca n't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home br br let me just say this , i have had small dogs before never have i seen such gas issues both of them consistently had foul gas consistently usually when they 're sitting on our laps but , you know they 're dogs br br when we got through the first bag of this stuff , we purchased more on amazon it was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of \( i think \) a 15 lb bag at petco but , they continued to have gas i mean , they loved the food , do n't get me wrong and they loved it more when we 'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food somehow that made their gas worse but i think i 'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down ca n't blame the food itself for gluttony br br eventually , we switched their food no more farting i think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies they just need that in their diet i think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful \( they said up until 1 year \) yeah right , you try dealing with gas for that long around 6 mos of age we switched to puppychow much better granted , they do n't like it as much , but we humans like it a whole lot better . 
a very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste br br in the 20 years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years br br i am so happy to find ahmad teas available here \( thanks amazon ! \) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away the current deal for the pack of 6 is superb \( much cheaper than i can find locally \) br br this is a great tasting tea , which i am happy to recommend . 
fresh , a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories they taste just like chocolate pudding . 
if you like the ceylon tea variety , you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea br br i am so happy to find ahmad teas available here \( thanks amazon ! \) and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20 years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years br br the current deal for the pack of 4 is very good \( cheaper than i can find locally \) br br highly recommended br br note this listing 's description is confusing each packet of tea weighs 500 grams , which equals 1 1 pounds or 17 6 ounces . 
i 've been enjoying this tea for years this tea is good mornings , afternoons or evenings my local store went out of buisiness thanks amazon ! i use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot . 
hi , i have to have black tea everyday i have done it in the past 25 years and it 's a habit of mine ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and i highly recommend it if you like black tea i think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so \) . 
i have tried it out despite the other review and i found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either russian or italian groceries . 
ahmad tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea great flavor with no lingering aftertaste . 
i love love love this deal it 's way fun to pick from so many ! teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees the other outfits that assemble samplers are boring they do the choosing , and from a much narrower range the sellers here are very nice , also , and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method \( it 's easy \) if you want great packaging , forget it they ship fast , and the kups are just tossed loose in a box who cares \? . 
once you 've tried some random sampler packs \( and now are overloaded with decafs , extra bolds , or teas \) , this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what i ordered this was my second order and i 'll be ordering this item again . 
good products and fast shipping equals a happy me a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price . 
if used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack . 
wow ! this product is very impressive i bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging , price and shipping the powder dissolves instantly even in water ! i 've just been mixing a 1 4 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great ! , but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next this product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries , especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away i think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well i'm excited to add more of the superfoods to my diet in this fast and easy way i definitely will being trying the other flavors soon . 
i am chemical sensitive as well as sugar free i have been using this product for over a year i use it maybe once a week at the most i drink 1 2 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how i feel imo this does n't replace my a m coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when i start to fade once in a while i drink a full bottle before a workout i 've been drinking guayaki yerba mate teas for years compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there i highly recommend this this product is clean and does n't leave nasty chems behind in the body try it before you judge from a review everyone 's body reacts differently . 
these nature valley nut lovers variety pack was perfect although i was n't sure about the peanut butter bar , it was excellent i loved the roasted almond , roasted pecan and the peanut butter br br i will definately buy from this seller again quick shipping and very fresh . 
had this shipped to my sister who follows a gluten free eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking , too good product , good value . 
these are healthy and my mixed llasa , tibetan terrier adores them and they are healthy and his breath does n't smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products a great healthy product . 
a great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle , rio he loves the taste and it sure beats my arm . 
i really enjoy this product i had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store once i found it i look no further , it 's the only sugar i use thanks so much . 
sugar in the raw \( tm \) please harvest cane w o burning br to be delivered to hc s br dear sugar in the raw folks , br br we who buy your product care about the environment and we 'd like to know that you care too when you burn the cane fields on maui , it adds to the co2 and worsens climate change and the smoke from your burning is damaging the lungs of your workers , your workers' children and the residents of maui br br we love your product and want you to change to no burn harvesting so we can continue to buy it , knowing we are n't contributing to global warming and lung disease br br . 
love this sugar i also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar recommend ! . 
product is exactly as advertised what a savings ! at least half the retail price easy to store because of the individual packaging . 
it 's just sugar in the raw , it 's flavor profile is much better then white sugar and it 's suppose to be better for you or something i just wish the bags were resealable . 
this is a delicious sugar it has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma but the granules are quite big , however bigger than plain refined sugar this makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together but if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it , or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it , it is a great product it would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer . 
i only use raw sugar , it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good will buy again . 
this sugar is very good use this in your coffee , cereal , etc for a week and you 'll never go back to white sugar , white sugar will taste terrible plus from what i 've read , this raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our diets br br the product was delivered fast and well packaged my only complaint is the price i wish i could find raw sugar cheaper i would be happy to buy in bulk , but this is the cheapest i have found . 
i really love this sugar and price wise it 's much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else . 
love this sugar it tastes so much better and is n't as overly sweet tasting as regular sugar we 've used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good the price that amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff . 
ca n't say anything bad about sugar in the raw i like it better than the other natural sugars better consistency and i know it does n't matter but better color unfortunately , one of the natural paper bags got torn a bit in the box it did n't look like the box was damaged so i ca n't tell how it happened , but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when i opened it not sure what the solution is and i 'd order it again , but if it happens again , i 'd switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag . 
great service ! items arrived faster than expected very efficient ! will use this seller again i highly recommend this seller ! thank you for the excellent service ! . 
please ignore the one star comments , if you check the bag the main ingredient is in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower with anything that is gluten free you have to add another binder which is where the corn flour comes in for someone who has celiac disease and cannot have sunchips , because they contain wheat \( a key binder to any chip , cookie or cereal \) this is an excellent product my spouse and i buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious ! . 
best flavor ever ! i'm addicted ! they are all good but these are by far the best i could live on these ! and there is no need for anymore to say . 
so many healthy products do n't taste very good or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill i 've had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty i 've served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them it 's also nice to have something gluten free for friends who are borderline diabetic but i would eat them anyway . 
i found these crisps at our local walmart figured i would give them a try they were so yummy i may never go back to regular chips , not that i was a big chip fan anyway the only problem is i can eat the entire bag in one sitting i give these crisps a big thumbs up ! . 
this is one of the best tasting crisps i have ever eaten ! i only buy it on special occassions because i know i 'll eat the whole bag . 
i use the rotel mild and i love this product so much it saves me on a daily basis if you 're trying to cook lower fat , healthier foods and in a hurry , this stuff makes it so much easier ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird tin can taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever \? for some reason this product does n't have that it tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans , heat and eat br br or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup i also make indian dishes with this , and spicey spaghetti sauce i also prefer this to most canned salsas , so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off br br none of my local grocery stores carry it at all , nor do they carry anything like it so i have to pay amazon 's inflated price to order this by the case i do n't like that i'm paying a higher price , but i love love love the product . 
the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for 1 dissapointing ! . 
this is a fantastic product , and i wish it was readily available in most stores it 's taste is not the greatest , but it 's a 2 5 oz shot , and it 's gone in a second it tastes , more or less , like a concentrated sweet tea for the record , i 've had 5 hour energy , and that tastes far worse i will put up the taste for the results it 's got 150mg of caffeine , which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters i ca n't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes , and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it the sugar is at 9g , which is n't horrible i used to drink 4 16oz red bulls a day for the caffeine , and this gives me far better energy , and is much more subtle my preference is black coffee , but i ca n't drink 8 12 cups a day anymore overall , steaz does it right real organic ingredients in moderate amounts , and they create big results . 
i have to get up really early to work out before work and i get super tired by the middle of the afternoon i was drinking one 5 hour energy , usually extra strength , each day it worked well , but gave me a jittery feeling , almost headachy but not quite my husband got me to try this and i was skeptical , but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and does n't give me that jittery almost headache feeling br br i do n't mind the taste it reminds me of the inside of a fig newton \( mmm \) and the price is ok , on amazon anyway at my grocery store they were almost 3 each , yike ! br br and it 's organic so i can feel good about it , right \? it 's all about me feeling good ! . 
i bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there he takes one in the mornings and works hard all day good stuff ! . 
if you want an organic energy shot , your choices are this one from steaz and the assorted flavors from guayaki guayaki yerba mate is actually in the steaz energy shot and energy drinks , and they both use sambazon acai , so there are some similarities in ingredients br br great energy burst for 4 hours on a steaz energy shot , and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work this will help me cut down on my iced coffees , which are not helping my calorie intake br br already ordering 12 packs on subscribe and save , 2 per month great value . 
i was looking for a natural energy shot that works , and i found it steaz energy shot is my favorite ! br br i recently had gastric bypass surgery , so tons of sugar is a no no and i'm also allergic to sucralose \( splenda \) so most other energy drinks are out br br i tried bazi energy shots and they did n't work as well as steaz , and definitely did n't taste as well these have a taste that 's almost like coca cola not bad at all br br if you 're looking for natural energy , give these a try . 
i had tried both of the guayaki energy shots and i do n't like the taste of either of them ! this one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better i like them cold for sure my husband and i take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we do n't have to make stops for coffee ! especially on the turnpikes where it 's just way too expensive it 's worth the per shot we normally split them i'm really sensitive to caffeine , even the natural kind so i get a little weird if i drink the whole thing but that 's the same for coffee too for me my husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost i would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there you can feel good about putting this in your body ! i 'll be ordering again soon for sure \) . 
i 've been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon as a software engineer , this is entirely unacceptable ! so , i asked the nice lady at the counter of my local whole foods market , for something that will give me that extra energy i need to get through the day br br she excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle over three hours after drinking whatever that was , my brain is still working at unnatural speeds to summarize my experiences i believe this works br br she did explain that i needed to drink plenty of water with it , which i personally feel helped the energy level so if you 're feeling tired during the day and hate coffee , give this a shot preferably before you eat anything br br woot ! . 
the energy shot truly does work ! it had a terrible after taste at first , but now that i know what to expect , i am getting used to it i always have some water handy as a chaser which helps ! i am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy i need without all the chemicals found in other beverages it 's helped me kick my addiction to diet coke and other aspartame laced caffeinated beverages yay ! ! ! . 
i 've tried 5 hour energy , red rain , nos , and other energy shots this is my favorite in terms of taste and effect plus , it 's somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used sometimes i wonder what i'm really putting into my body with some of the other brands i purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years . 
if you 're looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals , this is a great option the taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters . 
i first found steaz berry energy shots at a local organic market i bought two bottles , which cost just under three dollars each i fell in love instantly the drink is delicious i can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice , like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea i am very sensitive to sucralose \( splenda \) which is in so many energy drinks these days i also hate the taste i love that steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners the rush it gives me is slow and even i have several medical conditions , including fibromyalgia , which saps me of energy and causes intense pain i like how steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so i can get things done no caffeine jitters , even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle br it was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores , so i started looking online for a bulk price i am so thrilled to have found the pack of 12 on amazon i signed up for amazon prime specifically for this product , hah ! . 
i have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all , its also the best taste , others taste like medicine , this one has a tea fresh taste i love it . 
i drive otr over the road truck and this helps to keep me alert it has no sugar high no crash i'm on a autoship which i like the price is very good i 've seen it over 2 bucks in the store . 
products takes pretty good , and it does n't leave you gittery with subscibe and save as well as prime membership i pay below 2 a shot my wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style i moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training i recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an awesome energy drink . 
i use this product daily , and it provides a steady stream of energy i do not get jittery or crash it also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant . 
i 've been buying and drinking this for over a year now , and the energy boost is excellent , with a continuous , 6 hour effect the most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well , or perhaps i'm getting more used to it i do n't drink it for the flavor , but it 's not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other , non organic energy shots . 
i loved this mold ! i wished i could have used it for more than one occasion , but it did n't last i did use it to make 30 suckers for my daughter 's first birthday but there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that i would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions , but for the price it did n't matter to me that much it served it 's main purpose \) . 
you have to try the vanilla tootsie rolls ! the regular chocolate ones are good , but these are the best ever ! ! . 
try this you might like it i did and i am quite addicted , it is too easy to prepare , it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with the price is really good and well worth the purchase if you like this type of couscous like i do , then give this one a try it can be eaten hot , room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors , it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed i cooked the couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time i will be back for more . 
this tri color couscous is really good full of flavor and fun to eat i love the texture i cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs \( parsley , cilantro , \) along with some red pepper flakes at the end of cooking , i add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish highly recommend . 
i tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck so i decided to try good ole amazon com and selected this product it is so good add a few herbs and it 's a great side dish , or add more and make a pasta type salad so very good i am hooked great flavor and so easy to prepare ! . 
i love ordering whole bean coffee on amazon i like this so much that this my first product review i have to say that i'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee , but i thought i would give it a try when my husband started grinding it up , i could smell it throughout the house sometimes with flavored coffees , the smell is there but the taste is n't however , not with this one i'm now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try . 
i love this coffee i do wish it came already ground as i do n't have a grinder and use a blender instead but it 's worth it many flavored coffees i 've tried only seem to have a flavored odor that does n't reach the coffee , but this one manages both . 
this brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time i 've believe the company is local i 've been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it i'm particularly fond of the turtle sundae but all the flavors are good i ca n't say that i 've had a bad one br br as it turns out , it 's less expensive to order it from amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local walmart to get it it 's a no brainer try it , if you like rich , flavored coffee , you 'll like it . 
it is hot ! i love it , tasty and a little sweet i usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot , but this one lives up to its billing . 
i consume about a jar every two weeks of this , either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip it is hot , but after awhile the medium salsa suprema was too mild for me i thought maybe i 'd cut down how much i ate by going to the hot salsa ranchera it 's hot enough that people who are n't used to it will say that 's hot ! br br flavor bright and forward the similarly hot salsa victoria is a duller taste to me , i guess earthy this salsa is much brighter in the mouth i do n't like to go hotter than this because the sauces i 've tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot \( this happens to me with tabasco sauce , for example \) br br a drawback is la victoria does n't make a larger bottle of salsa ranchera nor salsa victoria , nor do they sell them in or sam 's club to get a good deal you have to watch for sales . 
service was great , but i meant to buy swiss chalet chicken sauce not the marinade \) br br love the sauce have yet to try the marinade . 
use frequently as we like to do asian dishes at least once a week love this product fast shipping , as usual would buy again . 
these individually wrapped pieces are delicious \( although i wish there were a few more \) mildly sweet with no sugar free aftertaste , even a traditional marzipan aholic should enjoy these . 
put this in my husbands stocking for christmas and it was a hit . 
i love the convenience of the singles the best creamer around taste is just like the big bottle i can stick them in my purse and take them to work . 
these creamers come in 4 packs of 25 i have taken one to work and opened one for home so far , and have n't found a single broken or leaking creamer yet i usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee , but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because i wo n't allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup i think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping ! . 
even though we are international delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product we had no problem with the shipment , but the creamer itself is thinner than international delight other than that we are happy d . 
besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers , i liked this item specifically because of packaging i could n't believe how many reviews i read about coffee creamer cups but many of the amazon creamer options \( both coffeemate and international delight \) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging br br that was not an issue here the shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each \( as shown in the photo \) those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes thus , none of my cups were broken , no waste and no sloppy drippy mess plus the four boxes means i could put one in the kitchen , one in the bathroom \( we moved our mini keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen keurig best idea my husband ever had \) , and one at work , with a reserve for whichever runs out first br br if you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like i was by the negative packaging reviews on other options , this is your best bet as a bonus , the auto delivery price is very reasonable . 
this seller is very nice and the price is very good the only reason i stop ording is bacause i went to sugar free , and at that time he did not have it but for those of you that do n't have to watch there fat in take , i would get this product from them . 
i purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee tea bags they 're great because they do n't require refrigeration . 
i found these new spring pop tarts and bought them on a whim my kids and i were amazed and delighted at the fun , colorful , amazingly detailed artwork on these pop tarts fantastic for after school snacks , lunch boxes , and school treats tie with a ribbon for a bright thinking of you this spring gift the only challenge is finding more in stores way to go kellogg 's fantastic product ! . 
yes , i am having a cup right now i went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee i paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money highly recommend . 
this is honestly the best seasoning salt in all the land it tightens up any dish not spicy , just perfectly seasoned it 's perfect , hence , my purchase of this 35 oz mamma jamma . 
the order arrived as advertised i have had only a few chances to use it , but it is awesome the flavor is exactly what i hoped for ! it may take me a while to finish the entire gallon , but i will definnantly order again ! . 
i like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly great quality , flavor and aroma ca n't beat that its organic ! . 
bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months , and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat i cut up cantaloupe , apple , banana \( even used sweet potatoes a few times \) just whatever i could get at the restaurant and it would keep my son busy long enough that i could actually eat ! it 's great because i did n't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks , and he got to try out new foods i would n't hesitate to buy this again . 
i have a slightly different version of this different brand my son started using it around six months , and he really enjoys it he does get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon , but whatever anyway , i also had trouble cleaning it , until i tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush that works pretty well it takes some time , but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender , or cut it up , then clean it up off him , the chair , the floor , the dog , me , well you get the picture . 
what a great idea ! ! ! ! my daughter love it br i do n't think is difficult to wash , i mean , is not like just toss water and that 's it but , come on ! ! ! ! br absolutely recommend it ! . 
i loved this product for fruits and other food that i did n't want my new baby to choke on i also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething it worked great for this , as well as for the food i did n't like bananas in it though impossible to get clean ! . 
this product is amazing i know a few people with little ones that use these and they love them ! ! super easy to clean and use when ordering these , i was under the impression that there were 2 per package fyi they 're not ! ! only one per . 
i ordered these for my coffee themed wedding when they arrived i had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good i literally had to hide the box to the wedding ! they were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables it was a great tasting product for the lowest price i 've seen ! . 
these are delicious ! the chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose crunchy and not bitter a href http www amazon com gp product b00067ad4u chocolate covered espresso beans 5 pounds a . 
the product was exactly as advertised and fresh unfortunately , i keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast we need to reorder to keep up with demand . 
these chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful ! the chocolate is very dark and rich and the bean inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing . 
popchips are so good i have been following weight watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal these popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence they taste so good , . 
i 've purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix \( which is a great product , by the way \) this is the highest price i 've seen whole foods carries this item and it 's been on sale there for 9 99 \( that 's canadian dollars , too , as i'm in canada \) it 's even cheaper on baker 's box 's own website , and they 're the company selling this product through amazon for a two pack they should be charging 20 or less what gives \? i thought amazon was where you could find competitive prices . 
the sugar was sweet , that can not be denied as advertised , it did n't melt when baked either however , it will not do for your liege waffles gaufres what the larger pebbles of belgian pearl will do these grains are smaller , think pretzel salt , or seed pearls . 
that 's exactly what i was looking for to bake some chouquettes \( puffs with small sugar pearls on top \) works great , yum ! ! . 
this is what i was looking for and was missing it the taste is exactly the taste as the one made in india so just loved it and remember my days back in india definitely recommend it . 
i bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than i 'd original expected \( a common problem in some fruit wines \) br br this is , indeed , good strawberry flavor ! just add to your sugary concoction \( be it a baking good , a dessert or a drink \) to either give strawberry flavor \( or add to existing flavor \) , and presto , just about everyone will be licking their lips \( and maybe fingers \) br br for those interested , i found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid . 
great stuff and dependable , especially when there are a million brands out there to choose from i love the stuff for really high end desires , i go with the apollo olive oils from california but i buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again . 
i had n't tried \( or heard of \) till recently weavers not it 's my favorite i am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and have n't found one yet , they 're all so darned smooth no bite , no after taste , a little pricy but still worth it no worse price wise than starbucks or peets will keep running through the list here and see what happens love them all so far . 
having always been a strict peet 's coffee lover , i was reticent to switch brands but weaver 's won my heart ! ! the taste is clean and strong , the ethos is correct \( organic , baby \) and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate be still my caffeinated heart ! . 
go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of weaver 's peru organic whole bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee and when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they do n't know better , take along a travel mug filled with weaver 's coffee from home and enjoy a real cup of joe er , weaver 's . 
im learning that latin american and south american coffees have this distinct coffee caramelish finish as a peets coffee fanatics we learned that weavers roaster was the roaster for peet 's and we are hooked ! i already reviewd the french and organic blend , but i must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drink br met the weavers team at the warner brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast since them we are fans br you wont be dissapointed ! . 
i like eating these whenever i need an energy boost br it has everything that i am searching for in a , to go snack br fiber plus chocolate is never a bad thing ! ! ! . 
these are my favorite bars ever the combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful ! very filling ! these are hard to find in the stores i'm thankful for subsrcibe and save ! . 
my fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us do n't carry them anymore ! once again , amazon came through and he could n't be happier . 
i was buying quaker oats granola bars but these nature valley chewy bars are better tasting , they make a great snack when i'm on the go chocolate , peanuts and raisins it does n't get any better . 
hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school he takes two bars now and is very happy to do so it is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores so again , amazon com came through with a reasonable price now , i came keep the husband 's breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings i often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack . 
nantucket blend coffee is one of my favorites i was suprised that it was a single box every time i ordered before it was a 2 pack my fault for not reading closer i will not order any more at this price for 1 \( 24 count \) . 
green mountain nantucket blend k cups make a very good cup of coffee in my a href http www amazon com gp product b000aqpmha keurig b 40 b40 elite gourmet single cup home brewing system a this is a very smooth tasting brew that my wife prefers over the a href http www amazon com gp product b0029xdzik coffee people , donut shop k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 50 \) amazon frustration free packaging a i generally drink in the morning br br these are good on both small and large cup settings as well br br highly recommended ! br br cfh . 
when we received our keurig elite for christmas , we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors of the 12 pods we had in the box , four were green mountain coffee brand i 'd never tried anything from this company before , but from what i had researched online , they have the largest range of keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well br br unfortunately , i was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee we tried their dark magic , decaf and breakfast blend and all were underwhelming , to say the least i was almost completely set on writing off green mountain altogther br br we had one gm pod left and being of the mindset of waste not want not , i figured i 'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely and i'm glad i did br br the nantucket blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee it is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent \( unlike some of the other gm blends we tried \) i added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go to caribou blend pods almost all in all , this is a very standard cup of coffee which , while it is n't anything new or exciting , is very pleasing and definitely one of the better keurig options we 've been able to test out when we run out of all the pods we 've accumulated , i 'll probably pick up a box of these as well br br now that i know green mountain is n't completely disappointing i 'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees \( with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered a href http www amazon com gp product b004i3y4ie green mountain coffee golden french toast , k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers , 24 count a to try as well \) and see how it goes from there br br if you 're looking for a go to choice , this is your cup ! . 
green mountain is my favorite brand nantucket is my favorite coffee from green mountain very smooth flavor not too strong and not too weak . 
i was looking for a replacement for timothy 's kona blend which is no longer carried on amazon this coffee from green mountain is very nice , but not strong enough for me if you like milder coffees , then this one is for you . 
one of green mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion , love it for your everyday blend , perfect stregnth , excellent blend ! . 
this is just fantastic chicken noodle soup , the best i have ever eaten , with large hearty chunks of chicken , and vegetables and nice large noodles this soup is just so full bodied , and is seasoned just right i am so glad amazon carries this product i just ca n't find it here in vermont . 
i have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking , i love the regular , i use it on everything you wo n't be sorry you tired it , great for dipping bread and cooking omelet , and green beans . 
oh my gosh , is this good ! like most people , i 've been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it then hubby brought a jar of this home the tomato flavor is amazing i will never buy store ketchup every again . 
sir kensington 's did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product the refreshed taste of this ketchup is a great update , and now leaves me disappointed when i'm given heinz while out at a restaurant br br for you heinz die hard fans out there , this is not the ketchup for you but for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in heinz , be sure to give this ketchup a try br br do n't forget the spiced variety purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first sir kensington experience is definitely the way to go . 
this is ridiculous the best gourmet ketchup i have ever tasted it is pricey , but wow love this stuff it would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup yummy ! . 
the tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor it is clean and really fresh ! perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich br br the spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup i have ever tried it is so good i have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy ! . 
i have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years the roland extra fancy porcinis that i purchased from you are the best that i have ever used , including the mushrooms that i bought in italy and transported back to the usa . 
i was pretty pleased with these mushrooms they were mostly large pieces , re hydrated well and had good flavor i 'd estimate about 25 of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces , most likely due to the shaking about in transit not a problem since i sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes there was a small amount \( perhaps an ounce or so \) of very small minced size dust like pieces still useful to add into gravies and the like nothing gets wasted ! br br the label says it is a product of china and italy nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country br br i'm quite fond of dried mushrooms while they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones , the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus additionally , i find the broth used to re hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews to save time and add flavor , i sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re hydrating them really helps meld all the flavors together i also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta the pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom infused water br br this was the first time i used the roland brand \( got it on a price dip from the amazon warehouse \) , and would certainly buy them again highly recommend . 
if you are a peanut lover , these are for you much larger than cocktail peanuts six people on my christmas gift list ask for these every year ! ! . 
the cashews were nice and big , with the vast majority being whole there were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag , but that 's pretty expected with so many cashews they made an absolutely excellent cashew brittle br br my order took just over a week to arrive , which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country they came double bagged in clear plastic bags , and in two 5 lb portions this was highly convenient since i could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until i was ready to work with it br br great value for the price . 
although there were several shriveled ones , they taste just fine i mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they do n't have to look perfect anyways for the price , they are a great deal \( about half of what i find them for in the store \) . 
i ordered these after a fair bit of searching online even ordering the smaller 1 3oz bags i will admit , i was a bit sceptical when i ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good \( or bad \) the cashews would be br br the order came in pretty fast like 3 days the cashews were fresh and whole with like 10 broken pieces they were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape first i found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal considering the second pack stayed fresh till i opened them the trick is to actually keep them in an air tight box so that they stay fresh longer br br the only negative i can think of is that the price went up abt 5 00 for the 10lb since i bought them . 
these nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty they are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can . 
i bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that i have at a couple of restaurants plus , he likes nuts , pecans , almonds peanuts he loved these i actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin , so he could take one to work , or his place , and stay fresh longer although i do n't think freshness will be an issue , they wo n't last long lol . 
got this free with another order i placed i could n't believe how much the cats loved it i will buy again for sure . 
this is a great ham soup base i have used it in ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans great flavor . 
before i discover this mix on amazon i always bought it in whole food store br i like this mix and when i am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy br just one small secret try to add the seltzer water instead of regular one . 
i appreciate the fact that i can buy this product online and have free shipping this is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture thanks again amazon . 
arrowhead mills buttermilk pancake mix is my favorite mix it tastes great , cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make although it can be made using water , i think it 's better made with milk i love it with pure organic maple syrup . 
the pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my son 's egg allergy it 's also great for camping or any time you 'd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available . 
hey ! these are great waffles and pancakes ! we have to add 50 more mix , tho , as the recipies on the bag are very thin but we have a lot of fun with this arrowhead mills buttermilk pancake waffle mix ! we serve them as is with fried eggs and real maple syrup , a href http www amazon com gp product b002483tsq butternut mountain farm vermont pure maple syrup , grade a dark amber , 1 pint jug a , or with warm strawberry jam and whipped cream , or cool whip , or add brown sugar to the mix to change the flavor and make a crispy waffle , or add 1 4 cup sugar and 1 4 cup malted milk powder a href http www amazon com gp product b001eq4hvc carnation malted milk , original , 13 ounce jars \( pack of 3 \) a , for awesome gourmet pancakes and waffles like they serve at the hilton ! its handy to have extra bags on hand , too , and you cant beat the subscribe and save price this mix is 70 organic , too ! . 
we are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergy br they taste fine for our family we like them many ways ! . 
a good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition everyone get the munchies is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips ! . 
this is a wonderful warm flavored tea , especially now in colder weather br this tea has a sweet , soothing chamomile fragrance it is subtle and sweet it 's one of the better chamomile teas br if you find it hard to sleep at times , a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help br if you really like sweet taste try bigelow chamomile mango herbal tea br i highly recommend both . 
this is one of the best mint chocolate syrup i 've ever had so far the others pale in flavor by comparison there are only seven ingredients in this sauce , including organic natural mint flavor in the past i used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch , chocolate chips , oreo cookies , caramel et al , because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale now i buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the santa cruz organic mint chocolate syrup really stands out but does n't overpower the flavor of the ice cream there are only 110 calories and because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste , i use it sparingly , so this 15 5 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups i used . 
this is a simple product and it is simply good there are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are it is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup , so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out this will be great for people who like mint , it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate i use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half , tastes great sometimes simple is better . 
a grande item ! delicious fish with the ultimate flavor , best ever in a can for all purposes ! i sent a case to my mother recently diagnosed with diabetes , and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties ! . 
i ordered this product at the same time as the kirkland signature salmon the raincoast trading co salmon is very tasty , equally as good quality salmon as the kirkland however , the raincoast arrived in perfect condition , the kirkland cans were dented badly i recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon . 
this tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an indian restaurant it 's much better than getting a teabag and making it the english way , with a lot of water and a bit of milk this is very creamy and tasty my only criticism is that there are n't enough sachets in the box only 10 since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water \( approximately half a cup \) , it 's not enough for a good cup of tea , so i use two that means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea but it 's a delicious after dinner drink ! i would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box . 
i love this product cant find it locally sometimes little out of the way stores have it but i also love the chicken , pork chop bags every store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market . 
this is the best way to cook a roast our local grocery went out of buisness and so i could not find this product till i looked here please continue to keep this product available ! . 
it 's always a pleasure to find french 's products on the web all of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but mccormacks bland and tasteless seasonings br br this is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find . 
if you like oreo 's or the oreo cakester , then you 've got to try the double stuff cakesters ! ! ! these are the best ! ! side note shipping was very slow , but maybe your chances will be better . 
i was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when i told them i bought this but out of the can ready mix with a little salt , pepper , spinach , and some cheese and it 's a great easy meal ! . 
the thing about marmite is that those who do n't like it hate it , and those who love it ca n't live without it it 's very much an english thing and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor \( as in victoria beckham is marmite meaning that those who do n't like her etc \) amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price last time i looked , it was 25 a 500g jar in british stores in l a county , or about 4x what it costs in england the amazon supplier was quick and efficient , and i now have enough marmite to last me to the end of the year \( or would have , if i did n't decide to send one of the two jars to my son in japan ! \) good job , amazon ! . 
whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie ! the only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast hope these do n't go the way of the dinosaur ! . 
these arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap the cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store br br i have no complaints but i also now have no more cookies we ate them all ! . 
i was not expecting to like these cookies as much as i do i like chocolate chip cookies well enough , but i really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones i have to say these famous amos cookies have pertty much turned me around the cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients the chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing these are truly great cookies . 
they are n't fattening and they 're good for you , right \? that 's what i heard , at least , from an admittedly unreliable person . 
great if you are cutting back on fat , they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them extremely dry and hard . 
i have never met a kettle brand chip i did not like these chips have a great loaded potato flavor , which are flavorful i like the sweet onion chips better , but these are also at the top of the list for great tasting potato chips kettle chips are great chips f the money ! . 
after buying bags one at a time \( at a hefty markup \) at nearby stores , i decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on amazon i was very pleased with the price and the products br br these jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy they have a slow building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag , which i'm embarrassed to say i did quite a few times br br the chips arrived well packed and fresh they had nearly a year of time before they expired , which is pretty impressive for chips br br most importantly , the price per bag was much , much better than any local store could do , although i live near an expensive city , so that may play a role in the price difference br br i would n't hesitate to order another box of these once i run out . 
i buy mostly for vending , so the size of the bag is important kettle 's 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full salt vinegar flavor is satisfying , about an 8 out of 10 . 
glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full it 's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well sometimes they are too wide or too plump with air bag size is good bbq flavor is about an 8 out of 10 . 
one of the best chips that you can buy and i 've tried all the kettle varieties , and many others there 's only a slight taste of jalapeno , and they are delicious perfect with a sandwich or alone br if you like being addicted , these are the chip for you see you at addicts anonymous . 
the title says it all great flavor , hint of spice , excellent crunch we eat kettle chips by the truck load at my house , we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite , never enough bags to get us to our next shipment i just wish amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save ! if you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself ! ! ! . 
wow ! i have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day kettle chips are the best non baked chips i have eaten i decided to try the sweet onion chips , since i 've never had them i now have a favorite ! ! if you like onions , this is a must buy ! i will definitely reorder these , as i mentioned above , they are the best i have ever eaten ! the flavor is great . 
i cannot say how much i love kettle brand potato chips kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors , and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water the ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in i love that these are n't filled with nasty chemicals i ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but i was torn between the a href http www amazon com gp product b0048ifusc kettle brand potato chips fully loaded baked potato , 2 ounce \( pack of 24 \) a and the jalapeno flavor while i know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better they include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which i'm fine with since i 've a vegetarian i ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and i ca n't guarantee how many i will have left my fiance and i love these the packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches , or handing out in gift bags , even just for portion control . 
now , i have n't done a side by side comparison , but these chips still taste like the real deal these snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store i work for portion control and reduced fat \? yes , please ! with the subscribe save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store . 
i love kettle brand chips ! br i 've been in love with the honey dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors br br sea salt vinegar chips are tangy , sour , and make my lips pucker when i eat too many at a time i got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon \( 11 what \? ! \? \) br br personally , the flavor is too much for me , but my mom aunt love them and they hate potato chips . 
these chips are thick and crunchy i absolutely love them the taste is perfect i like to buy these smaller bags because i cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good . 
i enjoy these chips i got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change i think those are better but only slightly , like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering the small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag . 
i love these chips , i buy the 24 pack once a month the bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags the jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor . 
these are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips i 've had i could still do with more vinegar flavor , but i think this is as close as i'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself br br i did a side by side with the cape cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful additionally , as other reviewers have said , they have quite a good bit of potassium in them \( somewhere in the neighbor of 15 rda per serving \) . 
i have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year i love them , but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favorite will be ordering them . 
these are my favorite gluten free dairy free flavored chips many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it 's nice to find ones that i can eat the vinegar flavor is really intense and good . 
these kettle brand potato chips in the spicy thai flavor really do taste like food i have eaten at a thai restaurant the ingredients listed include garlic powder , onion powder , parsley , jalapeno , and spices i'm not sure what other spices there are , but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me yum these chips are thick cut and very crunch they come in a seriously heavy duty bag i tried to open it like i do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart no way ! the bag is so thick i wondered if it was plastic i started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it sure enough , there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions tear here so easy why did n't i think of that . 
for me , kettle is the best brand on the market they really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods ! i did n't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips , but these are my new favorite the flavors are pure and real they go great with just about everything and are highly addictive ! i hope they come out with a low fat version their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors . 
salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip these ones made by kettle were very tasty and i enjoyed them thoroughly i just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste . 
what i like about them br 1 \) very thick chips br 2 \) no trans fat and all natural , according to the info on the bag br 3 \) flavor , but that 's a subjective thing br 4 \) 2oz bags , which keep you from eating too much at one time just set a limit of 1 bag br br cons br as another reviewer said , there 's a lot of oil in them chips what i do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off it seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off , but it 's true ! and at least this way , you 'll get rid of some of the oil . 
these are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many , a handful or two does the trick very crisp and savory . 
i have always been a fan of kettle chips when you open a bag of kettle chips you know you are going to get quality these chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package br br the new york cheddar chips have a very subtle flavor to them you can taste the cheddar in them but it does n't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might the taste lingers as well which is a definite plus ! br br another aspect about these kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp , that crunch in your mouth on top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags i have had since the purchase the only negative i might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain this is n't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and does n't ruin the bag at all br br overall the quality of the chips is fantastic the flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover ! . 
tried many varieties of bbq chips and hands down these are the best on the market ! these r not too salty or greasy great crispy crunch plenty of good bbq flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of every bag \( after bag \) is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st ! ! . 
kettle chis are the best ever ! these used to be my favorite flavor until i tried their salt and pepper kind but i'm sure this is just a personal preference br br crunchy , real potato chips ! . 
these chips have the right amount of crunch and i enjoy the taste chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning i like the 2 oz size bags , just the right amount of chips . 
i subscribed to these one case every three months that comes out to about 5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever i want because it seems frito lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items i want rather than the items frito lay wants me to have the two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the subway \( for example \) which i find works very well they 're large enough to be a good snack on their own , or you can even share a single bag over lunch the size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh no chip clip needed ! br br the only problem \? i subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones kettle chip consumption definitely have to hide the case from the kids ! . 
this was the best deal ever the delivery was fast , the chips are delicious and very fresh love it \) . 
my husband and i love these chips ! personally i think the flavor is perfect try them for yourself ! . 
the barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect ! just spicy enough , a hint of sweetness , just a little smokey the chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial , but not hard this makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers , hot dogs or brats , chicken or just about any casual entree . 
i was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store , lunds , but they were on sale , so i bought a bag i 've found that going beyond the simply flavored chips , like cheddar or vinegar , usually results in disappointment tried the thai or asian inspired chips by target , archer farms , and they were awful these kettle spicy thai chips are just awesome so much so , that i'm considering buying them in bulk from amazon the taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate the taste sensations prevalent in real thai food is baked into this chip sweet , salty , spicy was sour in there too \? i do n't know , but this is a well made well balanced chip that is addicting . 
as a professional potato chip muncher , i see these as thee very best on the market rich taste and flavor ! ! almost impossible not to finish the entire bag the true meaning of decadence ! . 
these are hands down the absolute best salt vinegar chips you can buy they have a great , strong flavor that has left me addicted these are certainly my favorite chips i highly recommend trying them ! . 
oh , i love these chips ! and they 're so hard to find where i am , and when i do find them , they 're usually 1 2 more per bag for less great that these are so cheap here at amazon . 
i love these chips ! it is a little weird to review potato chips but these chips are great the crunch is just right , plus they have just the right amount of salt not to salty not too bland they are a little oily but that 's ok the best thing is the 2 oz package when i buy a larger bag it 's harder to resist eating them all this 2 oz package allows for a little portion control be sure to use your scissors to open , 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and do n't open easily enjoy ! . 
in the past couple years i have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips , from the best i 've ever had to big disappointments if you have eaten the lantchips varieties , there is no way that they are not the best as a group the kettle chips are rightly salted and i was so irritated by some pringles products kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors all in all , its good to have choice amazon does not stock the lantchips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice . 
these chips are good , and bad , and create moral dilemmas constantly if wou are strong at will , or having a large bbq go for it , but as for me , i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days , had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it beware . 
kettle chips flavors can be hit or miss some of their flavors are terrible but this is very simple and delicious probably one of their best flavors br br pros thick , crunchy potato chips with light salt that does n't compromise on taste , eco friendly business that is n't just giving us lip service br br cons the occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open they have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time i end up tearing down the entire side of the bag use scissors instead . 
we bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in sonoma while we were on vacation i was n't sure what to expect by the package , and at first bite i did n't know what to think and then all of the flavors hit ! br yum ! they are a bit spicy , but nothing overpowering just lots of crunchy , sweet , spicy goodness they are n't sold everywhere though , i'm still trying to find them somewhere close to where i live . 
i have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive i ca n't stop eating them ! ! ! it 's crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt just perfect ! ! ! believe me , some chips are so salty , i ca n't finish a small bag but this one i just keep on eating ! . 
these are some of the best chips that i have ever had they sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands they are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time ! these will be the only chips that i buy from now on and i thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time ! .

these honey dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty , tangy , sweet and crunchy other brands i 've tried use too much mustard flavor , which overpowers the honey dijon pairing br br these chips make a great side dish on a bbq plate with baked beans , coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat naturally , they also go down great with beer br br as an oregonian , i'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends , especially those living outside our state and who have n't experienced gourmet chips i tell them kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer br br kettle brand potato chips are unmistakable a light gold color , rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips do n't have trans fats , msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosher br br i also recommend these other kettle chips flavors a href http www amazon com gp product b000g6mbua kettle chips sea salt vinegar a and a href http www amazon com gp product b000g6q4gm kettle chips spicy thai a br br annette solomon , a reporter for the salem statesman journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips solomon wrote , you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy , so you would want to select a semi sweet white wine also , a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger , lime , garlic and cilantro without over powering them classically , a german style riesling fits these parameters perfectly . 
these chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school they are by far the tastiest chips i 've had and it 's impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag ! . 
these are by far my favorite chips , they are extremely crunchy \( similar to other kettle style chips \) , but it 's the extreme vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks i 've tried several other brands of salt and vinegar and none of them come close . 
they are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut i much prefer the salt pepper just for the krinkle cut they have a better texture all around this brand is much better than frito lay and a good price on amazon when you get free shipping these are similar to tim 's or zack 's chips in that they are very crispy br br on a side note , these are the hardest bags to open by hand i have to use a knife or scissors everytime . 
it took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you they sure were eaten all up by my family and friends . 
these are delicious the 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches , definitely more than a serving . 
i recently tried this flavor brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are the best thing was that there were a lot of brown chips in the bsg \( my favorite \) , so i bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends i am a little disappointed that there are not , so far , very many brown chips in these bags , but the flavor is still very good i like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty , and the onion flavor is better if you have n't eaten kettle chips before , i recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk they are thicker and crunchier than lays but just as fresh out of the bag . 
we are always pleased with amazon 's packaging chips are never crushed or broken , always fresh we really liked this brand flavor of chips very tasty ! . 
these chips are some of the best i 've tasted they are not filled with chemicals you taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato not greasy perfectly crispy if you do n't like salt and vinegar tanginess , do n't even bother to try these definitely have zip i love them my children and their friends love them even my 4 year old loves them ! . 
these chips were a great deal kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips they are hard to find in vegas and are my favorite flavor shipping was very fast , sooner than expected . 
fantastic ! you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover . 
eat at your own risk once i would open a bag i could not stop good and salty . 
i do n't eat many chips , but these i love great buy and arrived quick and packed great expiration date is a ways away , so i have awhile to enjoy them great natural potato flavor i love brown russet , hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee . 
i simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends \) \) my experience with a lot of cheese favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side but these ny cheddar from kettle really changed my mind thanks to amazon for great discounts and i do n't have to buy them from the store anymore . 
bought this box of chips as a father 's day gift because dad loves them they are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips . 
these chips are quite tasty and the price is right packaged very well , would buy again . 
for some reason amazon would not ship these to alaska ! so i sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them they are very good chips ! amazon should rethink the shipping to alaska thing i would order groceries online . 
my husband likes these a lot they are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy they are more browner than i would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture not bad , though just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health they do have about 1 2 the calories in fat , however . 
just got this order and it is ok a bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me , if it is there . 
i took one and said good russet potato chip but where is the flavoring \? then all of a sudden , within seconds , it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy as close to thai food as a potato chip can get these chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming the flavoring included garlic , ginger , jalapeno , cilantro and other spices , and it just felt great to eat these i will buy these again these were a treat . 
we love kettle chips lightly salted and do n't feel guilty eating them ! we used to buy them at whole foods but buying from amazon has saved us money we have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery . 
a friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , these will change your life ! while my life is fairly unchanged , i cannot get enough of these chips and i do not even like kettle chips for the most part , i find kettle chips to be too thick and greasy , but the flavor of these chips is amazing ! the are the type of hot that is refreshing if you do not enjoy spicy or hot things try these anyway , they may convert you . 
but if you happen to , like me , there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip i 've found in this country . 
these are the best potato chips i 've ever tasted it 's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping the texture crunchiness is just perfect , as is the salt and vinegar combination i do n't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips i 've ever had , but they do and , judging from the nutrition facts , they seem to be healthier , too they 're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c , which could be because they do n't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal br br and if you like these , all of the kettle chips are great . 
i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them they are really amazing i love cheddar too , but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor i recommend them . 
this is easily the best potato chip that i have ever had look at the ingredients ginger and 3 types of hot pepper how can you go wrong \? br br obviously , not for you if you do n't like spicy food but , if you do like spicy food , you 'll probably love these they have that hot with a hint of sweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of thai food . 
kettle chips spicy thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet , savory and spicy everything you 'd want in a good meal or better yet a potato chip since these are kettle cooked , the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over browned they are , however , sliced just perfectly , not too thick , not too thin , so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off the flavor is tremendous , although i would n't describe it as thai it 's more of a vague , sweet and tangy flavor with a kick , and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger if you like any spice at all , these really are not overly spicy , so most people can handle them the fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher 's snack cupboard . 
okay , i should not eat potato chips , nor should anyone br but these are so spicy , i would find it hard to eat br very many that makes them an indulgence that br rescues some people from overindulgence . 
i do n't write very many reviews but i have to say that kettle brand chips are the best i have ever tasted every flavor is dynamite if you are feeling iffy about honey dijon , i would recommend cheddar beer , absolutely amazing and they 're healthy ! \( besides a lil fat \) i have eaten a lot of chips in my day and kettle takes the cake enjoy , and do n't eat them too fast . 
i bought these for the office and no one can put them down i'm ordering more today and it has only been 2 weeks did n't have to shop for them either , amazon brought it to my door ! . 
perfect ! ! they are my favorite because i can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt ! . 
amazon 's suggestion for a 4 star review is i like it that being said , i gave a 5 star review to the spicy thai chips these chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip , but whose taste buds do n't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor the only thing i really dislike about these chips \( along with the rest of the flavors \) is that the serving size is half the bag really \? who can eat half and save the rest for later \? \? \? not me . 
these are a favorite at our home we like the ones that have sea salt we also like barbeque flavored these are not ruffly chips that have ridges these are thickly cut plain slice potatoes they are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth they also have a great taste the sea salt ones , which are a favorite , have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips br br enjoy . 
these are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many they have the best potato flavor they came when you said they would . 
great chips , great price odds are that you will have them to yourself if you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar , you will love these the best salt and vinegar chips i have ever had \( and i love this flavor , mind you \) they are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own since i have found that s v is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species i know that my afternoon snack is all mine , unless of course i run into another heavy brained , hearty breathed like mind summary if you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels it is the first and only time i have committed to a whole case of chips and i will do it again mmmmm vinegar . 
great price for an excellent chip at about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip everyone i 've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste i 've yet to find a kettle chip that disappointed ! . 
i love these chips , which is why i bought them , to stock up for the entire school year the chips taste great , and packages were all sealed and in good condition when the arrived the box on the other hand was in tatters , with holes and complely squished i do n't know if that was a result of customs or the voyage , but to receive it was a bit disgruntling given it was falling apart luckily , there were no victims within all the chips are as they should be . 
totally orgasmic these chips are the best spicy chip i have ever tasted signed up for the subscribe and save option the case contained 15 \( fifteen , full sized bags \) of chips the price per unit equals 1 73 per package that is not even the cost of plain chips if you add the free shipping and the fast delivery , this deal is a steal so run like you stole something over to your computer and order the spicy thai chips p s even if you paid the going price of 30 00 , you are still ahead of the curve enjoy . 
seriously , now tasty , tasty , tasty fresh , too ! br br the only problem is that you have a pack of 24 and that can lend itself to wanting to make multiple trips to the cupboard for more helpings ! or , grabbing multiple bags to begin with pace yourself ! i keep saying br br you ca n't go wrong with these if you 're a fan of the salt and vinegar classic flavor br br 2 ounce bags are about double the size of the kid 's bags about the same size as the ones in the small gas station racks it 's really a good size for an adult br br it 's a somewhat healthier snack than a typical bag of fried chips , but it has 300 calories per bag again , not too bad , but something to think about br br bottom line delicious ! . 
despite coming in an extremely large box , i found this to be great value all the bags were preserved with a reasonable expiration date that is months away i 'd definitely recommend . 
if you like spicy , then these are for you i like spicy , so i enjoyed these they 're also crunchy , as kettle cooked chips should be . 
these are the best potato chips that money can buy there is just enough salt to taste it , but not so much that it masks the lingering potatoey awesomeness after you 've wolfed down a bag of these beauties each chip has the perfect thickness my teeth get excited every time i put one in my mouth ! everything about these chips is so perfect , it 's like they were made by god and delivered by gabriel himself now that i know amazon carries these , i do n't even have to leave my house to buy them ! i may never eat anything else again ! . 
i first discovered kettle chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at trader joe 's with my daughter mindy i could n't believe how tasty they were the best chip i had ever eaten it was love at first bite , and i 've been munching them ever since br br other things in their favor they 're thicker than other chips , so do n't crumble as i'm devouring them they 're delightfully crunchy and the salt and vinegar combination is heavenly i tried to create an original line to describe this palate pleasing taste treat , but could n't beat what the manufacturer said tongue puckering tang and crunch is n't that poetic \? br br as for health values , since kettle chips are not peeled during preparation , i'm getting more nutrition , such as potassium and vitamin c my mother would approve of that , and the fact that they 're hand cooked in small batches br br i often enjoy kettle chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea , but they 're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch well , actually kettle chips go perfect with everything except sweets , of course br br my only problem is that they 're so delicious i ca n't stop eating them that 's the reason i chose these smaller packets i figured 24 could last me almost a month , if i was a good girl , kept my appetite under control and hid them from the kids ! for the sake of fewer calories , i try hard and have succeeded so far it is n't easy , but br br have i told you how much i love them \? br br reviewed by betty dravis , 2008 br millennium babe the prophecy . 
you do n't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips and these chips prove it the taste of the potato comes through , instead of being masked ok , so they 're still a snack food , but no salt and no trans fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get and if you 're on a low salt diet \( like i am \) , having these available means i can eat chips , and kettle are just the best . 
these potato chips are excellent there are no trans fats br br they taste absolutely delicious whenever i am in the mood for potatoe chips , kettles is the brand i buy br br a great product that anyone should enjoy and i highly recommend them ! br br enjoy ! . 
it feels strange to review chips , but i am compelled because these are my absolute favorite chips kettle has lots of flavors but i always go back to these regular lightly salted br br they are thicker and sometimes greasy at the bottom of the bag , plus they often looked burned they are not actually burned it has something to do with how much sugar is in the potato that makes it dark i love to open a bag and find some browned chips br br lays and wise have their place but i 've become a chip snob thanks to kettle br br like edy 's or breyer 's ice cream , some products are worth the money these are the best of the best . 
i have tried a lot of s v chips and these are the best ! real sea salt and real vinegar ! mouth watering flavor crispiness not for the faint of heart the flavor is very authentic ! \) . 
kettle brand chips are very crunchy i would say regular plain old lays potato chips are at the soft end of the soft crunchy spectrum ruffles brand potato chips used to be considered the crunchiest , but kettle brand chips are far more crunchy if you have a tender mouth or bad teeth \( dentures \) you might want to steer clear of kettle brand otherwise , you 'll love these chips the sea salt vinegar chips are super tangy i enjoy taking swigs of vinegar bottles from time to time i am dissapointed with all other salt vinegar chips either because the chips are too soft and or the vinegar taste whimpy and or chemically rest assured kettle sea salt vinegar has a gourmet flavor the vinegar flavor has no chemical flavor and could never be called whimpy ! . 
someone brought these to a party we had last month and i did n't put them out because the buffet was full and did n't think anyone would like saltless potato chips last week we had some friends over and these were all i had in the pantry so i put them out oh my gosh they are so good ! i was so wrong to think they would be bland they are full of real potato flavor , wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting i am here on amazon to buy a case , i only want to have these with dips truly delicious ! . 
these backyard bbq kettle chips were a great deal with the promo code it was nice to have a larger size bag some kettle chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch ! they arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from amazon grocery have been great flavor and all natural ! . 
i have tried herrs , utz , wise , pringles , lays etc but kettle tasted the best the quantity of salt used is the optimum which is required br br although they say serving size 1 ounce , you will finish the whole packet in no time total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag this is slightly on the higher side but still it is ok , as they have not compromised on the taste br br only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips , which taste bad kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there br br thanks to amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon . 
chips are not as tangy as i hoped or expected poore brothers is a better choice for the hard core salt n vinegar fans . 
chilling in the fridge seems to boost the flavor even more and using them , rather than corn chips , to make nachos will have your tastebuds singing like janet jackson \( but without any of the associated wardrobe risks \( \) highly recommended . 
i was getting very worried , when i read some of the other reviews here specifically , the one star reviews , to which i always go , to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it br br wow ! they sure seemed to hate the kettle chips , backyard barbecue 9 ounce bags , \( pack of 12 \) , that i had bought as 1 ounce bags , liked a lot , decided to subscribe and then , for good measure , got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags br br yes i love potato chips especially these kettle chips , backyard barbecue flavour but others seemed to really hate them or at least , hate how they had changed br but then i realized they were talking about other flavours ! amazon , in it 's deep wisdom , has obviously seen fit to put all comments concerning all flavours of kettle , \( and other brands of \? \? \? \? \? \) potato chips , together ! br br of course , this does have some advantages , because most potato chip lovers , \( like me ! \) , enjoy eating several flavour , and brand varieties so , comparisons can be made easily also , as we 're all potato chip lovers , but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing , we are , here a sort of united nations of potato chip lovers all different , but all united in our love of potato chips ! \( the rest of the world can really benefit from the example of our tightly knit , but ever er , expanding group here , i think ! \) but not at first realizing that these br different flavour reviews were all together , did cause me a little confusion and dismay at least to begin with \( amazon should have mentioned that this is the kettle potato chip review forum ! \) br br i am happy to report that kettle chips , backyard barbeque flavour , are totally delicious ! \( at least they are in the one ounce bags hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same ! \) these are definitely chips for adults , however and or children whose stronger than adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips they are not the strongest flavour i have ever had that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me ! br these backyard barbeque chips by kettle , however , have just the right amount of sweetness , \( with honey powder , onion and sugar \) , to take the edge of the stonger flavours br \( paprika , chili pepper , cayenne pepper , and natural smoke flavour \) , of which there is less , \( they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners \) br br the complete list of ingredients of these kettle backyard barbecue chips , \( in the 1 ounce bags , and hopefully , in the 9 ounce bags as well \) , is as follows br br potatoes br vegetable oil , \( safflower and sunflower oil \) , br honey powder , \( dried cane sugar , honey \) , br rice powder br sugar br salt br onion powder br tomato powder br paprika br torula yeast br garlic powder br chili pepper br citric acid br cayenne pepper br paprika oleoresin , \( colour \) br natural smoke flavour br br naturally cooked , natural ingredients the combination is a true taste treat ! br br of course , as with all ptato chips , moderation is the key br potatoes contain a lot of potassium which gives energy and othr good things but too much of which can damage kindneys the vegetable oil is great but too much oil , \( as well as too much starch , from the potatoes \) , can hurt the eyes natural smoke flavour is so yummy but it , \( as well as sugar \) , has in very large amounts been linked to cancer production br br as far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go , this br can be ameliorated , \( a bit \) , by drinking tea which is good for the eyes but as far as the potassium , \( energy good , too much bad for the kidneys \) , and the sugar and natural smoke flavour , \( too much leading to cancer production \) the only thing is to do what is good in everything m o d e r a t i o n ! br br twice or three times a month , i allow myself to go on what i call a potato chip diet i eat only one large bag , \( or the equivalent in small ones \) , of potato chips all day i supplement this with tea , coffee , and lemonade , as well as several servings of carnation instant breakfast essentials , \( i like the dark chocolate flavour \) this adds up to fewer calories than i would normally eat , if i had my normal three meals a day plus snacks it also teaches me to eat s l o w l y , because that one big bag , \( or many little bags \) , never lasts as long as i 'd like anyway , with excercise and sensible eating , the rest of the month , \( and keeping my scale nearby , and weighing myself at least twice a day , every day \) , i 've taken off ten pounds in the last three months ! \) br br these backyard barbeque flavour potato chips from kettle , br are totally scrumptious except for those jalapino chips , \( which tasted good , but were far too spicy for my own taste buds \) , i have yet to meet a potato chip i did n't like to eat these kettle backyard barbeque flavour potato chips , with their combination of potatoes , sweetness , and spices , have truly become one of my top five favourites if not the very first favourite , of all ! br br flavoured potato perfection ! . 
these chips are very good ! ! i could n't stop eating them they did n't last very long br br the reason i gave them 4 stars , instead of 5 , is because i think the bags are a little hard to open i'm not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy , you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier . 
they are good but wish they were also baked have not found baked no salt potato chips anywhere if there are any i wish someone would post . 
i have loved kettle brand sea salt and vinegar chips since the first time i tried them the fact that i was able to find them on line for such a great price , was wonderful i would definitely make the purchase again they are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich . 
kettle chips are the best potato chip god has ever invented i give the lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice , a veritable cornucopia of flavor i have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the spicy thai sea salt and vinegar flavors , alternating days i have already lost 5 lbs , not to mention the myriad of other health benefits i have been experiencing get your life back with kettle chips . 
my daughter that has autism craves hot , spice and pungent foods these are her absolute favorite chips ! she calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time i love the crispy kettle way they 're cooked . 
i am a great fan of potato chips and of thai food i was so happy when kettle chips decided to meld two of my great loves together ! \( what a concept \) these chips are spicy enough , without burning a hole in your tongue also , they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming \( careful ! \) once in a while , this is a treat definitely worth indulging in . 
after reading some of the reviews , i got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst ! no worries here all bags are in great shape and expiration dates are n't until june chips , at least from the first bag , taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world ! by the way , fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so , yay team ! . 
i am glad i was able to find these on this site i love this flavor and they are so crunchy the box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs most of the bags survived in tact . 
these chips taste awesome and unlike most other flavored chips , they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip just do n't pass gas near any pretty ladies after consumption they 'll totally know it was you . 
with kettle chips , you really have to be careful some of their flavors are nauseating with that said , they do make fantastic plain chips thick cuts of potato , fried to a dark golden brown they are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt i ca n't recommend these chips enough you wo n't regret it br br some people say they are burnt but they are n't from their website take a quick look and you 'll see an immediate difference kettle brand potato chips are a beautiful tawny gold during cooking , the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize , creating chips from light gold to a deep amber the results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors , and an artisanal display in every bag br br some have also said that these chips are oily , which is true but they explain that on their website at kettle foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and or safflower oil to make kettle brand products both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way we have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are trans fat free meaning none were detected you will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging that oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used br br you will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor i'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips for those of us watching our salt intake , the unsalted chips is the best you can get period . 
these are among the best chips i have ever eaten ! i first came upon them when i visited a costplus world market store in opelika , al , in the tiger town mall , in 2007 i was n't a big fan of dijon flavored anything , but i decided to give these chips a try i was hooked i probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months' time i searched all over my part of alabama \( the northwestern part of the state \) and could not find them i later tried to find them at the world market in hoover , at the patton creek shopping center , and they did not carry this flavor however , when i learned that they were available on amazon com , and also available for prime shipping i bought them as soon as i read kettle chips honey dijon , 9 ounce bags \( pack of 12 \) ! br br you get a pretty big box , filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels they last quite a while , but i will re order , very , very soon ! i suggest you buy them , in this bulk form , and enjoy them you wo n't be disappointed ! they go great with hamburgers and hot dogs so they 're perfect for spring and this coming summer 's outdoor activities and cook outs ! br br take my word for it , these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods ! buy some today , and fall in love like me ! . 
i have never been addicted to anything in my life until i tasted these chips i have tried other brands of the sea salt and vinegar flavor and they are just not the same you 've got to stick with this blue bag of chips ! . 
i'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors , so when i opened my first bag of sea salt vinegar kettle brand chips i knew i had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber , carrot , celery and cherry tomatoes skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable br br as an oregonian , i'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends , especially those living outside our state and who have n't experienced gourmet chips i tell them kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer br br kettle brand potato chips are unmistakable a light gold color , rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips do n't have trans fats , msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosher br br i also recommend a href http www amazon com gp product b000g6mbv4 kettle chips honey dijon a and a href http www amazon com gp product b000g6q4gm kettle chips spicy thai a br br annette solomon , a reporter for the salem statesman journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips solomon wrote , you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy , so you would want to select a semi sweet white wine also , a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger , lime , garlic and cilantro without over powering them classically , a german style riesling fits these parameters perfectly . 
i bought these when on sale through amazon nice crispy thick chips definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale . 
i 've found a new taste treat i'm not a big one for potato chips , so i am sure i 've come late to discover these i think they are really good the processing ingredients list is actually pretty good no trans fats , etc so , if you want an indulgence , these are a ! they are thicker more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we 've all come to know they are much more flavorful never had a honey dijon potato chip before incredibly good a flavorful combination of sweet , tangy , salty also not overly hot or spicy excellent ! br br if you want a snack , have something really good it 's got to be worth the calories and these are ! . 
this is a real good product i love these chips and so does my customers ca n't go wrong wit these the best . 
i love these chips and now the whole family is hooked on them these are the only chips i eat . 
i do n't know what to say that others have not covered if you like potato chips you will like these get em on sale when you can and limit your intake if you can . 
if you 're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips br this is a great deal and i have not had any problems with them going stale br the 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over eating . 
only 5mg sodium per serving , chips are crisp i sometimes will dip in a low salt ketchup and that adds a bit to the flavor . 
i have found this product , kettle chips unsalted to be fabulous i found them by accident on amazon after hunting all over my local stores they are crisp and tasty without all of the salt . 
when i saw the spicy thai chips , i knew i had to try them i love spicy and i love thai food , so why not \? first off , these chips are not super spicy they actually taste sort of sweet at first , with many degrees of flavor the spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards i 'd say these are definitely a good , unique chip but if you absolutely hate sweet chips , i 'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet . 
smiles thank you lord , for i have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted , and tastes great i almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this the only thing i would ask kettle to change is the texture it 's slightly hard crunchy , but not a problem at all i would just prefer it to be softer kettle if you do make that happen , please keep everything else the same thank you . 
these are my favorite , but they are n't for everybody in a way , they sort of taste like oriental flavor ramen , but with a kick for me , how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger \? they are a bit rich , so they are n't for everydayforamonth snacking because this is a case purchase , i recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case the 2oz size seems to be no longer available , which is a shame i can eat the entire 5oz bag . 
salt vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so i think i 've tried every brand out there these are by far the best i also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy they seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste . 
package arrived double boxed , wrapped , and the inside box \( that holds the goods \) perfect not a single dent or rough mark , outstanding packaging br br the product \? br br these are the best chips on the planet , salt 'n vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips i 've ever had you might , actually i'm sure you probably wo n't like it at first bite 'if' you have never had these before but try it again br br not to mention , this particular flavor has held up in numerous surveys and comparisons against other manufactures . 
if you love jalapeno chips then kettle is a must try br nice and cruncy with the kick of jalapeno br delicious br addicting br recommended . 
my son bought a package of the jalapeno potato chips a couple weeks ago , and he and i have become addicted br br first , kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc than many other chips , as one peruses the dietary information br br second , individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them br br third , the jalapeno has some kick \( not overly hot , of course \) too many products labelled as spicy are not , have no kick , and are as bland as can be here , you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno my preference \? a bit more heat but i understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than i would still , decent spicyness br br all in all , i have been pretty happy with this product , in the few weeks since we first bought it i now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store . 
after looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box , i had to write a review i have bought these chips numerous times from amazon warehouse deals and each time they came packaged perfectly there was a sale at the end of the summer and i received a few cases boxes for just over 10 00 the chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag i hid them in the garage and only remembered them when i went out there that way i did n't eat them all as far as the pictures , if the person contacted amazon , he made out ok amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called amazon thanks for a great tasting product , good price and quick shipping i 'll buy these again soon . 
this is the second purchase of kettle potato chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them we bought them by the a carton of 24 bags the kettle chips were in a 2oz bag which is just enough for a single size serving snack or with a meal the chips are so delicious , baked not fried and lightly salted with sea salt they have 0 fat , no preservatives , nothing artificial and they only use real food ingredients what more could you ask for in a great tasting chip ! . 
how to achieve potato chip nirvana \? it 's simple buy these chips , get them tomorrow , eat them ! br repeat br br why \? br br best old school bbq flavor out there br kettle quality br incredible price with amazon br br did i mention delicious and a terrific bargain \? . 
i found these more than 10 years ago in a health food store after i bought one bag i found myself stopping by that store once a week to get these chips the new york cheddar flavor is so good , you will have a hard time not eating a whole bag . 
but you will enjoy ever step i gained 5 lbs within a month of buying this 12 pack of full sized bags damn it ! they should warn you about this ! tastes awesome though when i finish my crash diet i will order another box \( case \? \) \) . 
these are the best spicy chips i have ever had the pleasure of eating they start off sweet , then as you eat more the spice builds up they are fantastic if you do n't want to commit to a whole case , pick up a bag at your local whole foods first , then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are got my case right here , and loving every bite on a side note , this brand \( kettle brand \) has many delicious varieties this is just my personal favorite i also highly recommend backyard bbq , honey dijon , sweet onion , buffalo bleu , salt and pepper and death valley chipotle lays aint got nothin on kettle brand ! ! ! . 
i 've eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and they 've always been terrible i did n't expect much when i bought these but after i tasted them i was amazed i have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these they have a natural potato flavor with thick , crunchy chips the only bad thing is the bag is a pain to open use scissors and save yourself the aggravation . 
kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips i 've tasted thus far they are thick , has a bite to them and i love their creative flavors my favorite kettle chip happens to be the honey dijon i think it 's a great combination sweet , salty and tangy , perfect for one of those snack attacks when you do n't know exactly what you want i especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch these 2 oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions \( like me ! \) . 
as an oregonian , i make a point of sharing these oregon made snacks with friends who visit the state i tell them the kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrew does for beer br br kettle brand potato chips are unmistakable a light gold color , rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips do n't have trans fats , msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosher br br annette solomon , a reporter for the salem statesman journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with spicy thai chips solomon wrote , you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy , so you would want to select a semi sweet white wine also , a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger , lime , garlic and cilantro without over powering them classically , a german style riesling fits these parameters perfectly br br i also recommend a href http www amazon com gp product b000g6mbv4 kettle chips honey dijon a and a href http www amazon com gp product b000g6mbua kettle chips sea salt vinegar a br br the honey dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty , tangy , sweet and crunchy other brands i 've tried use too much mustard flavor , which overpowers the honey dijon pairing the honey dijon chips make a great side dish on a bbq plate with baked beans , coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat naturally , they also go down great with beer br br the sea salt vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber , carrot , celery and cherry tomatoes skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable br br in summary , i highly recommend kettle brand chips , a great buy on amazon com . 
i'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors , so when i opened my first bag of sea salt vinegar kettle brand chips i knew i had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber , carrot , celery and cherry tomatoes skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable br br as an oregonian , i'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends , especially those living outside our state and who have n't experienced gourmet chips i tell them kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer br br kettle brand potato chips are unmistakable a light gold color , rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips do n't have trans fats , msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosher br br i also recommend a href http www amazon com gp product b000g6mbv4 kettle chips honey dijon a and a href http www amazon com gp product b000g6q4gm kettle chips spicy thai a br br annette solomon , a reporter for the salem statesman journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips solomon wrote , you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy , so you would want to select a semi sweet white wine also , a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger , lime , garlic and cilantro without over powering them classically , a german style riesling fits these parameters perfectly . 
kettle chips are thicker and crunchier \( though greasier at times \) than other chips , and the honey dijon flavor is great they do n't have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have , and the 2oz size is great for an adult size snack . 
i 've always liked salt and vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag not with these , the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until you 've finished the bag these are very addictive if you like salt and vinegar , these are the ultimate chips nothing else compares . 
tasted good spicy those that do n't like spicy should stay away from this for the price paid , very good buy . 
these are seriously delicious , especially if you like plain potato chips my only concern is they 're very oily i understand they 're kettle chips and they 're fried \( small batches and all \) but when you open the bag \( that 's another thing , very strong bag ! need scissors ! \) there 's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves i suggest a blot shake on some paper towels before consuming either way , they have a yummy potato taste , and very satisfying crunch delicious ! . 
this bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool , such as scissors , do n't even try without scissors br br they are crispy and taste like chips that are n't advertised as being salted they definitely are n't healthy , because i can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them , and i can see the grease at the bottom of the bag , too br br they are high quality chips , and deserve to be put on your table . 
kettle foods , inc makes the best tasting potato chips i 've ever eaten with a variety of flavors , from classic barbeque to their unique spicy thai you 'll find the right flavor for your mouth and not only do they taste wonderful , but these all natural chips are cooked in safflower or sunflower oil for zero cholesterol br br but why is it a gogreenmart more product of the week \? kettle foods , inc is a green giant , a company highlighted for their environmental practices they convert waste oils to biodiesel to power some of their company cars a roof top solar panel system creates 120 , 000kwh annually for production and they offset 100 of their additional u s energy usage by buying renewable energy credits not only are their efforts for the future but they care for the present by rejuvenate a neighboring 2 acre wetland eco system and during recent building construction , they earned a gold rating from leadership in energy and environmental design \( leed \) br br now your mouth will thank you and so will the environment . 
these really are amazing chips do n't be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheese it is so subtle that even blue cheese haters \( like me \) will enjoy these . 
these chips are delectably delicious i am on a low sodium diet i did n't have to give up totally something that i truely love to snack these chips are bursting with flavor , and you ca n't really tell they are missing all that salt there is just a kiss worth on a chip , but beleive me , it is a total makeout ! ! ! . 
not too salty like regular supermarket chips , this is a snack that will not overwhelm you with guilt ! when you just gotta have some chips , kettle chips lightly salted chips are the what you 've been searching for br br there 's no cholesterol , no trans fats , no artificial anything and because of the manufacturing process , they actually seem to have kind of a home made quality br br this is an excellent product ! . 
i agree with the company motto a natural obsession i tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent the flavor of these is very strong , so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor , like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread otherwise they compete or clash with the other food . 
the new york cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the kettle brand potato chips these are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy unfortunately , it may do the opposite to your backside , so do n't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom br br i still give it a 5 of 5 stars br br also , the online price at amazon is better than anywhere else i 've seen them combined with amazon prime you 'll be getting a great deal on these chips . 
these are my new favorite ! i have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one ! they do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these br br price wise i do not see that they are that much of a deal here i purchased them for 2 99 at the grocery with no shipping i would have given the product 5 stars \( easily \) had it not been for the price the taste is fabulous you wo n't be disappointed . 
these chips were good i ended up eating a whole bag a day for a while cause they were so good i am glad that they do not have any dextrose in them like lays do . 
these are the best chips out there nothing can beat this taste if you like honey mustard then you will definitely like this once you eat it you wont stop addicting stuff . 
at first i was thinking , cheese flavored chips \? but i love them the herbs they used are just delicious the cheese is not overpowering they are yummy and crispy ! ! . 
i try to be good , but when i feel like indulging in some delicious , gourmet potato chips , these new york chedder potato chips are the first flavor i like to go for , when i see them at the natural food store the chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand . 
i got the sea salt and vinegar chips from kettle i am used to the salt and vinegar chips in the white bag if i am allowed to say that anyways , my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price i got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price you can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging , also well being used to the cheaper chips i was n't expecting how mellow these things are the ones i am used to have a really sour taste to them which i did n't mind but they had tons of flavor these chips do n't have any sour to them at all , and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste if you want to try out salt and vinegar chips i suggest you try these out first so , for the price and how many you get , these chips are definately worth it they are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants i recommend these , 4 stars . 
we 've long enjoyed this brand of chip , so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these br br granted i bought them somewhat reluctantly because i'm a confirmed salt aholic , generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans i was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot br br how nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt . 
for those who love salt and vinegar potato chips , this is the one to choose the flavor is zippy and tart , with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less natural versions of this snack the 2 ounce bags are just right to share at lunch the chips are a little greasy , and that 's why i 've given them 4 stars instead of 5 . 
kettle lightly slated chips are my favorite on the market i do n't care for the fancy flavors and these are salted just right thick , super crunchy and full of flavor , they are the best ! . 
fantastic tasting potato chips i love the individual bags , great for kids and adults too no trans fat , no cholesterol , no artifical stuff br low in sodium and high in potassium , which is great for people like me with hbp br only problem is amazon is out of stock some times and price is high . 
the chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips the bags are very strong much thicker than , say , lay 's potato chip bags inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips , salted just right because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion , some are cooked more than others , which gives it a more authentic , non manufactured feel some people may not like that br br i reccomend them ! . 
my 8 yo is a kettle chip addict so i was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch ! ! ! great quality and much cheaper than in the stores ! ! ! will definitely be buying more ! . 
this may sound rediculous , but i actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when i ordered these kettle brand jalapeno chips at the time i placed my order , i could n't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that i had recently discovered and liked , and the kettle brand chips were packaged in a similarly colored bag but , it all worked out for the best because i do really like the kettle brand of jalapeno chips , and will happily munch away on them during upcoming tv football games when i run out \( probably sometime next year ! \) , i will likey purchase miss vicky brand of jalapeno chips , and i plan to try the other flavors of kettle brand chips imho , kettle brand chips are excellent and i recommend them to all potato chip 'affection ados' br br sincerely , br br homiedog . 
i think these chips are awesome if not the best along with poor brothers salt and vinager chips but if you buy these spicy thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor \( at the bottom of the bag \) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time i bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010 so i would suggest trying spicy thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces . 
this kettle chips taste good , crispy crunchy too ! u will enjoy it also ! moreover , it 's thinly cut sliced ! . 
i knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips the price per bag ca n't be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated . 
this is a delicious tea ! br br i'm just now becoming a tea geek and really exploring the stuff i like , and earl grey is amongst the top , especially with bergamot br br the problem i find is the amount of bergamot added is usually too little , or too much br br this one is perfect ! i really like the balance in the flavor i do n't add anything to this tea , just a part of a teaspoon in a cup and in 2 3 minutes it 's ready br br tastes like an expensive tea but priced like lipton definitely recommend it for fans of earl grey with a kick ! . 
i bought this tea as an alternative to very pricey teavana black teas i have a cup every morning , very smooth refreshing tea . 
the tea tin is guarding the aroma very well br the taste is beautiful the malva flowers do soften the taste and the amount of bergamot is just right br the first time i used too much tea and soaked it for too long \( i used as reference darjeeling ftgfop first flush \) br since then i save on the quantity of tea leaves and soak the tea for only two minutes br a delight the best earl grey i ever had the price is very competitive . 
pros br extremely fragrant br full bodied br can be steeped twice br nice air tight container br organic br br cons br price br br the tao of tea , blue flower earl grey black tea is the best earl grey i have ever tasted , and i would recommend it to anyone br br a href http www amazon com gp product b001eppfgo the tao of tea , blue flower earl grey black tea , loose leaf , 3 5 ounce tins \( pack of 2 \) a . 
after a lifetime of tea drinking , i can honestly say that this is the best earl grey i have ever tasted i have ordered it a number of times , and each batch is consistently excellent i have even given it as a gift , as its container is superb for keeping loose tea fresh the metal canister has an inner lid that is lifted with its own attached knob , so the tea stays dry and fresh for the length of time it takes to use it up do yourself a favor , if you like earl grey , and treat yourself to this tea . 
these biscuits are delicious , not too sweet , with just enough crunch we love them quick delivery we would order them again very satisfied . 
excellent , lo fat , lo calorie treat for dogs i have a german shorthair pointer and these treats are her favorite \( the organic peanut butter cookies are for smaller dogs , but she loves them and for weight control i like them ! \) . 
my male maltese dog had been enjoying the old roy 's puppy biscuits from walmart then i could n't find them i was desperate to find a treat that would measure up i ordered six bags of the peanut butter and crossed my fingers br br they arrived , and my little guy loves them he gets one heart shaped biscuit at bedtime he sleeps in a crate when he hears me touch the bag of treats , he beats a path to his crate in high excitement they are a big hit with my him they are well worth the price they are high quality and i can even smell peanuts in them . 
this product does a great job of clearing out the kidneys it has helped make my husband feel lots better even though he is in early renal failure . 
love this with a bag of shrimp 3 4 pound , some stir fry veges and a little onion chopped not too hot but very tasty . 
so i got this and tasted it strait out of the bottle , it tasted like smoky flavored milk yuck ! i was depressed i was stuck with 4 bottles of this it sat on my shelf and i forgot about it last weekend i tasted a zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor , it tasted weird and smokey like the lorann oil i had gotten i tried to doctor up the soda with a little sf vanilla torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream it tasted amazing ! ! ! the odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel br br so i wanted to see if this would help the lorann oil too i put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it , it tasted fine then i added one drop of the oil , it is very strong , and stirred it in it tasted so much better ! i whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat br br now i will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream it was such a happy accident to find out how to use it when added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream br br it is very potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting , if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch . 
we make up a coffee creamer with 1 4 part commercial coffee creamer , vanilla , butter creme , almond and bavarian creme flavors and the rest milk it tastes wonderful and is half the price of store bought ! br br it is excellent ! . 
i'm from detroit , and i was raised on vernor 's ginger ale once i moved to california , though , i found it difficult to find vernor 's it would pop up here and there , and then disappear i guess without advertising , it just never found a home br br i prefer the plastic bottles , but the ideal size is the 16 9 oz \( 500 ml \) or the one liter the problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person \( me \) too long to drink it , letting it go flat br br in any case , vernor 's is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years , i think that imparts a great , unique flavor br br i wish it would catch on again , and become available more widely br br \( recently i did see it on sale in redwood city in california 's bay area , south of san francisco the next day , it was gone ! . 
i like vernor 's , and drink it all the time it is old fashioned drink from michigan , since 1866 , and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character if you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste vernors has a strong vanilla presence , is smoother and more moist , and sweeter than a ginger ale it is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale , very good a ginger ale is more dry , higher in carbonation , and has a spicier bite to it vernors has 39 grams sugar per can , versus 33 grams per can for schweppes ginger ale neither has caffeine br br the recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners they use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost cutting mega soda companies use , rather than the cane sugar they used to use the down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors many microbrews are using cane sugar again , although it costs more , to get a better taste vernor 's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years , no doubt accounting for the smoothness all in all a great soda for anytime the soda is also known , like other ginger drinks , for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach br vernor 's is a regional soda , and there are many areas of the country you ca n't find it in that is why it sells here they may be selling it in glass bottles again soon , at least there is a page that says so the day i am writing this comment search at amazon for asin b001jk2seg to see what i mean vernors has quite a history , and there are two books at amazon about the soda the first is vernor 's ginger ale \( images of america michigan \) isbn 10 0738551856 the second book is the vernor 's story from gnomes to now isbn 10 0472066978 a book about the company 's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome , and vernor 's fans . 
if you want to find a good flavor substitute for maple syrup , barley malt , or brown rice syrup , this will do nicely i use madhava 's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time , and am always pleased with the results at the time i'm writing this , amazon was out of stock as a vendor however , when it was in stock , it was priced well for the 2 pack br br other than baking , i 've used it to top waffles , pancakes , and in small doses \( 1 2 teaspoon \) added it to oatmeal a little goes a long way br br using agave nectar use 1 3 to 1 2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener \( depending on your taste and the recipe recipes with dried fruit need much less \) , cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees f if there is oil in the recipe , cut it by 1 3 \( alternately , use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid just do n't use too much or your recipe will be dry \) additionally , when baking , make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry most bakers might already know this , but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients \( unless beaten with butter first \) br br agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do , so you wo n't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy however , i highly recommend it for baking it makes everything moister br br if you are looking for less caramel flavor , you 'll need to use the light version of this product \( equally good in all applications \) . 
good quality nectar very tasty br br however , i was expecting 46 fluid ounces , not 46 ounces in weight br br i find that 46 ounces in weight makes about 32 fluid ounces . 
first time i 've ever used agave nectar and it is great keeps the blood sugar stable great buy also ! . 
this sweetner is the best , it brings out the true flavors in what ever you add it to and it has great health benefts . 
i love this stuff it sweetens without affecting the blood glucose levels now if i could only figure out how to make tequila i would be set just kidding . 
i finally have found a natural sugar substitute that has the added benefit of having a low glycemic index agave is delicious ! i have recommended it to many friends , and it is very economical to purchase the 46oz bottles . 
i used to buy the wholesome sweetners agave and like it a little better , but switched because it became too expensive so this is the cheeper option the taste is the same , but it seems a little less sweet because i find i have to use more of it to get the right sweetness in my coffee i do n't like the container it does n't pour well , so i have to pour it into a better squeeze bottle , so that i do n't have a sticky mess on my counter every day it 's fine for the price i continue to have it shipped to me every other month . 
i love using this to sweeten tea , coffee , etc it tastes much better than other low glycemic sweeteners there is no bitter aftertaste . 
i ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product it works great for cooking , baking and as a substitute sugar in my chai lattes . 
i really like this product and taste great with the coffee or tea , and i have lost weight by cutting the sugar and replacing it with the honey and agave nectar . 
we have been using 17 day diet guided by low glycemic eating for about 6 7 months , with fair success this amber agave nectar has become our primary sweetener because of the low glycemic effect on blood sugar the taste is mellow , and the sweetening power is higher than sugar so you use less , but without the twang of honey the one thing i have not tried it on \( still using sugar \) is making kombucha i still use sugar , as i'm not sure it would be a good idea to introduce a raw element into kombucha but actually , that may just be my own over caution and nothing related to actual chemistry or circumstance br br our primary uses are sweetening yogurt , using it in the little baking i do , and use in salad dressings , fruit desserts , etc because we are limiting our sweets consumption , we do n't use a lot of this , but it 's nice to have when we need it i plan to try using it in some homemade jams later this season i buy it on subscription , and the cost is about 33 less than the local walmart and more than 50 less than the health food store on this same brand best by date on the bottles i received in may is 2015 . 
i am so glad i was introduced the this brand of sweetner to replace sugar , this is so much better i really like how it sweetens my herbal sweet teas without having to use too much , and how it can be used in place of pancake syrup too learning how to use it what the first thing i had to learn , once i learned how to use it , i became hooked i would not even look at sugar any more i highly reccomend if you want a clean fresh taste and feel to your foods if you do purchase this sweetner , take advantage of ship and save , it will save you lots of money in the long run . 
i love this product ! it is the best natural sweetener i have ever tried , and i have tried many you can use also as pancake syrup or as a substitute for honey on your peanut butter and honey sandwich it last a long time , and is a good value . 
i have been using agave nectar for several months now and have found it to be a staple in my home madhava agave nectar is good tasting , it was a good buy ! . 
this stuff is great because it 's low glycemic substitute this to sugar and you 'll be doing your body a great favor this size is economical and shipping is fast , too i got mine very soon . 
save a little money buying in larger quantities , as opposed to the smaller bottles i like the taste of agave , cross between honey maple good for pies , cereal , frozen yogurt , etc . 
this is an awesome product which i 've ordered many times honey like flavored , lower glycemic sweetener that 's great in coffee or tea . 
thank you for this product we use it all the time and appreciate your promptness and the price was excellent thanks again . 
i am on a low glycemic index diet to help control my blood sugar and hormone levels my nutritionist recommended agave nectar as a sweetener since it 's gi index is in the low 30 's as opposed to honey in the low 50 's and sugar in the mid 50 's i 've tried supermarkets , health food stores and wholesale clubs the prices are usually around 13 for a 32oz bottle and this is 19ish for 2x46oz it 's used like honey substitute 2 3c for every 1c sugar and reduce liquids by 1 4th br br i also use it in a carrot cake recipe \( equal substitution \) instead of sugar where i substitute whole wheat flour instead of white flour and i do n't decrease the other liquids it 's delicious and you 'd never know that 's it 's actually good for you . 
i was out to dinner with friends family at the saloon in rte 46 entertainment complex in sanford fl besides having an awesome staff \( ask for keith \) and fabulous food \( the escargot is a must \) they serve china mist tea this is the 1st time i chose the tropical organic green i have no doubt it is the best flavored tea i have ever had . 
if you 've tried the conventional kettle crinkle chip verson salt and peper , you can't compare these to those ! these are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat , but oompletely enjoyable you finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices great stuff . 
these are the best tasting tortilla chips i have ever had ! i have become allergic to tomatoes , but i love tortilla chips there is so much flavor in these chips that i no longer miss pico de gallo i prefer to eat them plain they also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful , but not overpoweringly spicy . 
these potato chips are delicious ! i have not had potato chips in approximately two years as it has been difficult to find organic chips amazon lowered the price on these , and i finally had a chance to order them i most definitely will be ordering them again ! my family and i love them they are pure and void of all artificial flavorings the true flavor is present , and it satisifies the need for something salty , sweet , spicy , and crunchy a . 
these chips are a great snack if you do n't want all the junk assiciated with chips try them you 'll like them . 
i love these chips the flavor is not plain they are sweet and spicy all at the same time the only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt but , it still a great flavor ! . 
thesedo n't like hot food they might be a bit much for you they have a great balance of sweetness and spice of course , kettle chips are just good chips they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty i also like that they are ridged chips those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me i do n't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness if you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips . 
just the right amount of spice to make them hot and they are also sweet ! very hard to find in new jersey can not have just one bag around ! ! . 
i ca n't believe how wonderful this chip is ! the slightly spicy after taste gives the chip extra punch and flavor my family and i are offically addicted . 
these chips are perfect for snacking with or without salsa the texture is brittle and thin , like other plocky 's chips br br the only downside the spice is minimal . 
i think plocky 's brand as a whole is a cut above in quality but i found these to lack in taste somewhat and be a little greasy . 
these are the best chips i have ever eaten everyone in our family loves them sweet but spicy crispy really good delivery was perfect , no crushed chips fantastic overall . 
a nice case of chips that are quite tasty i definitely enjoy the kettle sea salt and black pepper i just wish they were bigger bags \) . 
i ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service oh my word ! spicy \( but not burning spicy , more like tongue warming \) , sweetish , salty a really strongly flavored and delicious chip if you like barbecue flavor , this is a nice sweet mexi fied barecue br br i also like that it 's organic br br i ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes my bad but dang , if they 're not sinfully delicious br br granted , 5oz is not a whole lot \( it was skimpy for the price , which is often the case when it comes to organic \) , but it was 750 calories at a pop geesh br br yes , 150 cals per 1 oz serving that 's about par for the course for fried chips br br verdict fattening , crispy , flavorful , delicious best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low fat sandwich or soup br br enjoy br br mir . 
at first you think that these chips are n't all that spicy , but the spice will grow on you with each bite they are really very good ! . 
i ca n't say enough good things about plocky 's chips ! ! i have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor a href http www amazon com gp product b000gwko7g plocky 's tortilla chips , black beans 'n rice , 7 ounce bags \( pack of 12 \) a and i love them ! they taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying i have never eaten a tortilla chip that did n't make me feel guilty afterwards not with plocky 's i always eat less and feel satisfied i actually prefer these eaten by themselves no dips and i keep a bag in my desk at work i have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something i bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too i am a fan of plocky 's chips and will continue to purchase them on amazon . 
my aunt gave me a bag of these and i was immediately addicted there are actual pieces of beans in the chips and they are not overly salty like other chips i love the zip , agreed they are awesome without salsa , and no trans fat ! . 
we love these chips they can be eaten alone , since they are so crisp and tasty or with a dip every one that we have introduced the chips to , loves them and the expiration date is for 8 months from now , so ordering 12 bags did n't come near to them going stale . 
i bought these chips , and wanted to try if they were tasty it sure is ! unique and different flavor and the right thickness br br it remains crunchy , spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat there are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips however , some of the spices are lacking from this chip but i liked this very much br br i would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips go ahead you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese maybe some el pastor , shredded meat , tomatoes , etcetera . 
i love these chips for its unique taste and incredible crispy texture used to get them at henry 's in san diego , ca before we moved out of there and have been ordering them from amazon since running out of them constantly ! . 
these chips are the only ones i found to be tasty and healthy they have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutrition the perfect blend ! . 
we love these ca n't always get them in local stores , they do n't keep them stocked even though we are always buying them out strong enough to dip in any condiment , great flavor and grain texture . 
these spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned , you will be left with some stanky breath afterwards ! the first time i ate these was at night and then even after brushing and flossing i could taste them in my mouth the next morning so just be careful about when you eat them , especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day . 
the first time i ate these chips was in aruba in 2007 i could n't find them in our area \( ct \) so you can imagine my joy when i found them on amazon i love these and hope you continue to carry them your prices are terrific too i pay 2 99 in aruba and they run about 2 46 a bag when i buy the case of 12 through amazon good job ! ! ! ! only problem is , now everybody wants them here and they steal my bags when the case comes in , but that 's ok sharing is good . 
these chips are delicious if you like salt pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch , then you ca n't go wrong with these they are the tastiest bag i 've come across the sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt , in fact i have trouble cutting myself off mid bag even though i normally enjoy a low sodium diet i would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8 9oz bags . 
i used to buy these at the local supermarket , but they are no longer carried there finding them on amazon i purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as i remembered for chips they are also very healthy i definately will buy them again . 
plocky 's red beans and rice tortilla chips are really tasty i shared a few bags with my daughter in iraq she said ummm they are good they are good for you too no artificial stuff . 
we like plockys br they like us br plockys plockys br mean no fuss br taste so good br and healthy too br plockys plockys br grab a bag or two br thank you plockys ! ! . 
i love these potato chip they r soooo good ! \) sweet and spicy but not overwhelming just enough to work up the palate , not salty just enough to balance out the sweetness i will be ordering these again soon love it ! . 
the best potato chips i 've ever had at the best price i 've ever paid the service was respectable and the shipping free . 
i love this product all of the different flavors are fantastic my family likes the 3 grain the best no more corn tortilla chips in this house ! . 
love these chips , and i do n't even like black beans very tasty yum ! ! plus , good for you ! . 
these chips are fanfreakintastic they are with out a doubt the best chips that i have ever had a nice sweet smoky flavor and then a little bit o heat oh ya baby . 
nice amount of heat and smoke very tasty chip that goes great with a brew . 
these chips are salty with a hint of sweet they are crisp and crunchy they are the best chips i 've ever had ! . 
we ordered these only because the black beans and rice , which we really really love , was out of stock after about a week , we finally opened up a package and then kicked ourselves for not having tried them earlier there is a little kick to them after you swallow them to let you know you have had a hint of hot pepper of some sort we took them to a pot luck that night and came home with an empty bag i used them , from another bag , as a garnish on a salad that i took to the pot luck and we came home with an empty salad bowl ! br we will definitely order these again a href http www amazon com gp product b000gwlugu plocky 's tortilla chips , red beans 'n rice , 7 ounce bags \( pack of 12 \) a . 
i was first introduced to the red rice beans chips in my hometown of bethlehem , pa when i moved to north carolina i was unable to find these chips in my local area on my trips back home , i would buy a bunch of bags to bring back with me to nc then i discovered that i could order them on line and life was great these chips are my all time favorite and everyone that i serve them to loves them just the same you just gotta try them you 'll be hooked ! ! ! nancy walsh . 
ok if you do n't want to get addicted , do n't try plocky 's red beans and rice tortilla chips ! my husband and i started with one seemingly anodyne bag from a store now , we 've just received our second case it wo n't last long beware . 
my husband \( who , being mexican , is very picky about his tortilla chips \) and i absolutely love these ! the texture is light and crispy , rather than thick and crunchy he actually usually prefers a very hearty , cruncy chip \( like el ranchero \) , but the flavor of these is so fantastic that we 're both thilled with them the bean , rice and corn base makes them incredibly flavorful , and they have a touch of onion and garlic in addition to that we go through an embarrassing amount of them i never , ever like plain chips , but these i can eat without anything else , although they 're particularly amazing with a fresh salsa i highly recommend these ! . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b000gwlugu plocky 's tortilla chips , red beans 'n rice , 7 ounce bag \( pack of 12 \) a i first tasted these chips while visiting relatives in ky they are not available where i live , so i ordered them from amazon wow ! my friends and family are all addicted to them the spicy flavor grabs you at the first bite once a bag is open , it is gone ! . 
we like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market they are even great by themselves we will order these as long as they are available thank you for making them accessable br br shelly kenyon . 
plocky 's chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness they are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips the flavor out performs any tortilla chip i have ever eaten they hold up great to salsas and dips nothing wimpy about them i just wish the company made a bigger bag ! love them usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery , but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty order by the case you 'll be glad you did as they disappear fast . 
i love these chips and ordered them after i had some in florida my case of chips came without any packing inside all bags in a box with no cushioning at all needless to say most of the chips were broken and i would not order them again a great item but if they ca n't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money . 
i received this chips in a gift basket and absolutely loved them i searched high and low , but was unable to find them until i saw them here i immediately ordered a case these chips are light , crispy , flavorful , and good for you i love them with dip , in chili , or just plain once you try them , you 'll be hooked ! . 
these chips are truly amazing they have it all they 're light , crisp , great tasting , nice texture , and they 're all natural and low in fat and sodium ! need i say more \? i recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store , and could n't belive my taste buds that 's why i excited why i saw them here on amazon , and decided to buy a case ! . 
these are the most fantastic chips i 've ever had ! i could eat the whole bag myself ! they 're made with lots of whole grain and beans , and make a complete protein , so i have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks they are great ! the only problem i have with them the bag is too small ! ! ! we need a bigger bag ! ! \) . 
they did a very good job with shipping the order quickly nothing like ace hardware who took a week to ship . 
wonderful candy , hard to find i got a huge bag and put it in freezer it came shipped nicely in a sturdy box and heavy plastic just great ! . 
i bought thi9s for my dad for a surprise birthday present because he could not find them any where else ! ! . 
so surprised to find the taiwan shaped pineapple cakes , they are so cute ! br i 've never found any pineapple cake like this at our local asian supermarkets , so i ordered some from here these lovely pastries made our dragon boat festival party much more fun my friends and i think it is a good idea to order them again for our mid autumn festival party . 
i really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here unlike some of the mass production pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring , tasselfield 's pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference you can even taste the fibers from pineapple br br i opted for the traditional pineapple this time i will be interested in trying out the longan or mango variety next time . 
i purchased this 24 pack of big ass soda and only got 23 immediately i was all like oh man , this is gonna suck ! regardless of the quantity error though , it sure kicked some red br br everyone in my town absolutely loves it i highly recommend along with other soda , voltages br br malcom . 
well being the big red fan that i am , i bought some of this first of all let me tell you the price is amazing , i mean where else can you get this type of deal in saudi arabia everyone in village loved it , of course now they are wondering when the next shipment will get it . 
this cinnamon cake loaf has a wonderful natural flavor it 's moist and tender and a great little sweet treat when you want something that is n't terribly bad for your diet it 's delicious ! . 
i work in college financial aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students i used to buy them in the grocery store then learned i could get them for less online \( 17 for 3lb bag \) and thought that was a good deal until i found this great deal ! . 
well worth the money i did the calculations on different bags and this dollar amount is an excellent value there are approx 2338 pops in the box so far i 've been through about half the box and have found about 3 without wrappers that 's pretty good considering if you need 30lbs of dum dums go for this product enjoy . 
this is pretty good canned meat the sausage i used in dirty rice , the hamburger i used for taco salad , the chicken with wild rice , and the pork with stuffing the turkey i gave to a neighbor because i do n't eat it the various meats are all pretty good quality and was enough for 3 large portions each can there were n't large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans , which i 've experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats the proportion of liquids to meat was fair too , it 's not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either , though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat none of the meat was seasoned , at all this is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring there is a mild spam like texture and taste to the meats \( but way better than spam any day \) , almost a brine or something , that 's why i heavily seasoned it do n't plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats , it gave everything a slightly rancid , soury taste no idea why ! due to the higher calories and higher price , i will only stock this as emergency food i will buy more for that reason .

if this flavor lasted longer than it does , i 'd probably die of starvation for lack of wanting to take it out of my mouth . 
this gum is super sick tatooes are killin flavor is a spankin' this brings back bomb diggity memories yo peace out . 
this is pretty good regular style soy sauce but it is not super wonderful better than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an asian market the main value is as a unique gift br in the japanese soy sauce world , there are 4 types regular , mild \( usukuchi \) , for raw fish \( sashimi \) and light colored bluegrass soy sauce is regular style compared to kikoman \( a good commercial brand that is widely available \) bluegrass starts saltier , is flat in the middle , then ends with a complex interesting flavor kikoman is less salty initially and has a round , full flavor in the middle does n't have the complex ending flavors for me , the initial saltiness of bluegrass is a minus and kikoman 's full middle flavor is a plus i prefere kikoman , especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct but i lived in japan for many years and am used to the standard japanese flavor i have n't tried bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor , which is how soy sauce is usually used br bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite if you want a unique kentucky gift for an asian friend , this is different than the standard bottle of bourbon or box of chocolate . 
i watched an episode o how things are made on discovery channell and saw bluegrass soy sauce featured on a whim , i ordered a bottle it took several weeks to arrive , but when it did what a surprise my teenage son wanted to try it , and did he loved it immediately now he puts it on many things my wife and i were very pleasantly surprised and liked it very much in the past , i made many trips to the far east and developed a real liking for soy sauce \( where virtually all of it is made \) what a treat to find a handmade american product , that competes with \( and wins \) , against a japanese chinese national staple ! . 
my bottle arrived just in time for a sushi dinner and game night planned with friends i had three soy sauces to choose from after some sampling we were all using the bluegrass ! everyone enjoyed the light smoothness a subtle sweetness we were splashing right on every piece , rather that dunking dipping friends wanted to know where i found it i'm going back to order more right now , and i 'll be ordering 3 extra bottles because they are going to make a great little gift that 's affordable and unique instead of the traditional bottle of wine that so common it 's boring . 
if you enjoy the flavor of soy you will really like this br br plus its hand made in the good ole usa . 
i recently acquired a bottle of this and was immediately impressed it has good flavor without all the excessive saltiness of supermarket brands i 've used it for marinades and dipping sauces in addition to straight use and in all cases it has added a little something extra quite a surprise to find an american made soy sauce that tastes this good ! . 
this soy sauce is the best we have ever had thanks to amazon , we were able to find it again it makes a big difference when using this product thanks again . 
this is the most delicious soy sauce i have ever tasted i will surely order it again such deep flavor . 
saw this on how it is made , which was a very interesting process br decided to give it a try , i really enjoy the flavor it adds br looking forward to trying it on several more dishes br thanks to those who brewed it ! . 
most soy sauce is from japan but they are having problems with radiation in their soy bean fields i am not sure how long the contamination will last i like the idea this product claims no gmo seeds yea you pay more but decided not to take a chance on japan . 
i'm pleased with these was n't sure how they 'd be able to replicate the autumn classic flavors of caramel apples , but figured werther 's was a good bet i'm diabetic , so wolfing down a real caramel apple when the mood strikes just ca n't happen as often as i 'd like to do so but these are tasty enough to get me through until i can 'carb budget' the real thing these are made with sugar alcohols , so it 's wise to limit how many are eaten in a day unless you 're going to be near home and have turbo flush on your toilet \( tmi \? \? \? \) this pack of 6 will last a while , but they 're definitely a 'will reorder' \) . 
this is a bold blend that has a great taste the flavor comes bursting through i usually brew drink organic sumatra mandeling from bj 's i use this blend exclusively , so to get a cup that rivals the complex flavor from my tassimo brewer is fantastic come on amazon add it to the subscription service . 
we 've tried many tassimo flavors this is by far our favorite our normal cup of coffee is starbuck 's house blend out of a cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our tassimo this coffee is rich but not too stong i do n't understand the current price over 20 for 14 disks and hope that it will be lowered on amazon for now , we 'll buy elsewhere . 
this is one of the best choices , in my opinion i also adore amazon , but they need to negotiate a better price for their tassimo disks these are available at bedbath beyond for 10 and i always get 20 off which brings it down to 8 00 they were 7 50 \( before the 20 off readily available coupons \) until about 3 months ago again , this is an excellent blend with full flavor not bitter i think it 's my favorite . 
i have tried about 75 of the available t discs , and the kona blend is one of the best regular unflavored coffees for tassimo it has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering , and has a pleasant aroma personally , i would enjoy it more if it were stronger bolder however , being a bit mild , it goes well with breakfast and or \( gluten free \) baked goodies i find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect , nor is a subscription service available originally found this at \( dead bats from \) beyond , used a 20 coupon , and was happy with the final price . 
of all the coffee 's available for tassimo this kona has the richest flavor and fantastic aroma by br far my favorite . 
i think these are my favorite cookies ever really light and creamy too bad you can no longer find them anywhere for less than two hundred count ! i do n't think i need that many . 
the milka naps mix gift box is a fun , unique gift for those tired of whitman 's and the usual american brands nothing wrong with whitman 's , but sometimes a change of look and flavor is nice br br as a sampler , it provides only a few of the milka options four flavors are here noisette , hazelnuts , alpine milk and strawberry all are delicious , though i do n't like strawberry chocolate \( in any candy \) personally , and give those away to eager friends the naps box are perfect for coffee tables and as a standalone dish at work br br milka and its famous purple cow , is owned by kraft , is an eastern european chocolate originally produced in switzerland and is available in germany , austria , hungary and other nearby countries br br distribution is still weak in the united states , but can be found increasingly in larger cities usually , then , it is found only in international grocery stores , though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time it has been around 100 years whether or not kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen for now , the texture and taste are better than hershey 's and nestle it is a smoother , creamier basic chocolate br br i fully recommend the milka naps mix gift box br br anthony trendl br editor , hungarianbookstore com . 
i ordered for my dad for fathers day and he ate the whole box within two days br he said it tasted really good , now i want to order some for myself , haha . 
great candy and our family loved it it was smaller than i imagined it and i thought it was expensive for how small it was however , i am in germany and can get it easier here the shipping to the usa makes it expenive great product and fun for our usa family to receive . 
i eat mustard with everything , this is hands down the best mustard i have ever tried , in fact everyone i tell to try some , falls in love with it as well spicy , tasty , real quality br if you like spicy mustard , you will love this . 
this product works wonders if you have stomach issues i would buy again once i need more 0 \) . 
our ferret loves this rabbit it 's a nice high protein treat in addition to his regular evo ferret diet the price was reasonable compared to our local pet store , which does n't often have this item in stock . 
my son made this he did n't have the patience to be precise about the water temperature and when , half an hour before it was done , it appeared not to have risen at all i feared for the worse determined to be polite , i agreed to have a sandwich using the bread it was amazing apparently it rises during the baking or something br br great tangy flavor \( perfect for a meat sandwich imho \) and not heavy at all fortunately we had lots of deli meats , since the whole loaf disappeared within the hour br br we 've had all but the sourdough peasant bread so far i'm sure that will be delicious as well . 
these were great just as described used them for a bee themed party , and now we use them as to go packs of honey for our coffee and tea .

my son is a sb fanatic so i was so excited to find this for the 2010 holiday season as every year we do some version of gingerbread i knew by reading reviews that there would n't be enough yellow frosting so i whipped up so edible glue \( water and confectionery sugar \) to hold the levels of gingerbread that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside this worked great it was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating the licorice was worthless though . 
i was pleasantly surprised to find this item had been delivered the day after my order , my speediest delivery to date it probably helps my location is near everything looks just as described and pictured and i'm very happy to have done business with this seller the gingerbread house was carefully packaged as not to harm the fragile pieces inside i'm excited to give this item as a gift . 
these cookies were fun to paint but not too tasty to eat ! br the kids did not really care much , but it might have been br more fun if they could have eaten them br br they really had fun coloring them ! . 
this tea is the best tea i 've ever had i first tasted it in norway , and had to find it in the states i have it every morning . 
i love the aroma and the taste of the fruit and vanilla combo , and the addition of ginseng for an added energy boost rounds this tea out nicely for me it 's a sweet tea , which makes it a wonderful healthy alternative to desert after dinner br br i see that others did n't like it , but it 's really a matter of personal taste different courses for different horses ! . 
the best chocolate in the world , in this critic 's humble opinion , is made in the united states and the best chocolate in the united states is made in california , by the ghirardelli chocolate company it is surely the best chocolate that one can find in so many stores , malls , etc throughout the united states their actual stores are rare , but kroger , wal mart , martin 's \( formerly ukrops \) and a long list of other grocery stores and many malls stock their products br br i have never encountered milk chocolates with caramel filling to surpass the quality of these these are chocolates deserving of poetry you can eat them quickly , or take your time and savor every moment of eating every one the choice is up to you . 
this is a good quality brand of chocolate with many flavours of which this is just one very tasty and a fast delivery too . 
my mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven they did n't believe they deserved receiving these , but i know they did deserve to receive these ! . 
this is the best caramel chocolate combination i have ever tasted the caramel is liquid and complements the ghiradelli chocolate perfectly do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight you will end up an addict like me br the ghiradelli product is far better than the caramello hershey product in every way the caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the ghiradelli squares , and the caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste comparing the two is like comparing warren buffett to myself in terms of wealth unfortunately i am the caramello bar in this regard br at the very least try the ghiradelli . 
this chocolate treat is a great gift and it arrived right when i expected it to i gave it to my girlfriend as a surprise gift and she absolutely loved it . 
the first time i ordered this it came all melted but amazon was quick to remedy the situation by sending me another of the product and it was great thank you . 
low calorie and satisfying these soups are a nice fill in when you do n't want too much but do n't want to be hungry for a few hours . 
purchased this as a gift for my mother when it was a lightning deal she was very happy and loved the basket she enjoyed the cookies and the flavors of tea that were included shipped quick and arrived when expected . 
received very quickly and extremely well packaged since this is a smaller sized basket , it would be an adorable present for anyone who likes tea , for self or just to have to hand very nicely assembled with attention to detail . 
these small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that i have never been able to find in the past when i wanted them amazon now provides a link they can be used for what are commonly called jello shots , and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups . 
i bought these chocolate liquor cups for a party ! it was a big hit they are high quality and a good buy . 
great for serving chocolate liquor adds a touch of class to your event and elevates you to host supreme being able to eat the cup afterwards is just icing on the cake . 
delicious chocolate cups , each in its own aluminum holder i could not find these in any local store , so was happy to find them on line br most people are unaware of them , so they are impressed when i serve them a little cordial or other liquor in a chocolate cup after sipping the br liquor , you can eat the cup what could be nicer \? excellent product . 
the holiday liquor cups were exactly what i was looking for the chocolate is br delicious and holds up well to the liquors . 
strawberry twist has a long lasting pleasant flavor sweet but , not excessively so delivery is timely and price is just right supieror to other trident flavors ! though , spearmint is n't bad either my next pick would be blueberry . 
i love this flavor and i cant find it on the shelves anymore the gum tasted fresh which is actually way better than when i used to buy it in stores ! . 
if some other yahoo deems it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he does n't like the taste , i feel i must assert that in this as in all matters of taste de gustibus non disputandem est br br i really love this gum ok it does n't really taste like strawberry , but it 's still delicious it has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through , but then it gets tired , stuff , and squeaky br br you 'll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find , as i did , that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid by obsessively chewing this product i filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose 25 in 3 months br br also , it does n't lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight . 
best dog food on the market today had numerous ear problems with our cocker spaniel and they have cleared up since taking this food . 
my father could no longer take care of his beloved 6 year old cocker spaniel , so i decided to take her into my family when i brought her to nyc she had ear and eye discharge she was also slightly overweight after a check up with a vet that ruled out infection , i decided to try royal canin based on the numerous good reviews within a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight this is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her ! . 
our spaniel has tried several foods in her 6 years , and this is the only one she will eat by itself without any people food being added \( of course , we still treat her occasionally \) when we went in for our 12 month tooth cleaning appointment , the vet told us to take her home as her teeth did n't need any cleaning for another 6 months , at least it is specially designed for their teeth and health needs , and she loves it and it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store ! what more could you ask \? . 
royal canin was recommended for my dog , but since this line of dog food is specific to breed , it was difficult to find in stores petsmart and petco carried the cocker spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio finding a larger bag has been a great deal my cocker loves the food too ! . 
this is food especially designed for cocker spaniels who have a range of health issues i have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it it also is packaged very well and as a result stays fresh for a long period of time great product ! . 
i tired many different dog foods over the 3 yrs i have my cocker spaniel i then came upon this breed specific dog food figured i 'd try it my dog loves this food and always finishes his food i 've used this for over 1 yr now he has not tired of it i have seen a significant change \( for the better \) in him , he 's more active and doing well br br i only buy this brand food for him now br br buster gives it 2 paws up i give it 5 stars . 
i bought this for my one year old cocker however all the dogs love it all their coats look better , they all shed less , eat less , use the bathroom less , my cocker used to have this one chronic ear since the time i have had her as a puppy that it just gave her problems it seems to have cleared up , no more smell her eyes give her less problems and my 7yr old yorkie he eats less , he used to throw up all the time had the most sensitive tummy our black lab mix , hot spots and she would just lick her fur off all these great changes in a matter of a month i do mix it roughly 50 50 with naturals dog food blend they are doing great br br sept 2012 br i love this breed specific food , however i just went to place my next bi monthly order and i am shocked at the price hike in just over a month ! i paid br 41 79 on aug 3 for a 25lb bag and here it is sept 20th and the price has is now 53 94 , a difference of 12 15 in price ! this is a huge amount to go up considering that i am assuming this is a price gouge due to the speculation over crops \( i will look to my local vet for this product i can get a large bag now less at petco as well with the discounts they offer they will order a larger bag if you ask . 
fast and great service , my cavashon loves this low fat dog food thanks arrived in great condition , thank you thank you thank you . 
we are chocolate moose mickey moose , br br our nice owner bought this great food for us we love it very much , i have gained 5 lbs because i eat all of mickey 's food when he is n't looking ! our skin and fur is much better now too \) . 
my 7 year old cocker spaniel loves this food and it 's good for him he needs to lose a few pounds and this is doing the trick glad i found it on amazon hard to find elsewhere . 
my 50lb bag of oatmeal seemed like way too much , but as time went on i found more and more uses for it i have so many recipes that i make weekly that i'm running out ! this is a very high quality oatmeal and much cheaper and better than anything i 've found in the grocery store . 
better than organic oats advertised elsewhere takes lots of water these are not minute oats , so my oatmeal cookies come out right , not all crumbly and soggy \( instant oats have their place , but not in cookies \) . 
honeyville rolled oats is a delicious product i am using them to make a product designed to increase and enrich the milk production in lactating mothers br the oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is i only paid 4 99 shipping for 50lbs of oats ! i encourage anyone who likes oats to order honeyville rolled oats their flavor is above all the rest . 
nice flavor , not too bitter we really like this coffee we have been searching for a coffee that pleases the whole family 's tastes and this is the one . 
my first taste of this tea saved my trip home from santa cruz , when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags how i needed my fix ! a tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned , and this chinese breakfast yunnan black tea set me straight br br other reviewers have said it tastes odd the flavor is strong and a bit smoky , like darjeeling , only earthier like darjeeling or earl grey , it has enough flavor on its own no milk or sugar needed but it 's expensive by the box of teabags finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic ! it arrived promptly , well sealed , and true to the label unlike some loose tea that 's actually cut up , this has the whole leaves that unfurl ahhh . 
this tea has surpassed all other breakfast teas in this tea drinking household we love it and it really starts the morning off right perhaps it has more caffeine than our old favorites \? \? the taste is wonderful without any additions and it will remain our tea of choice in the morning and often throughout the day . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b001ell9x6 numi organic tea chinese breakfast yunnan black tea , loose leaf , 16 oz bag \( pack of 2 \) a i brew iced tea in the refrigerator by the half gallon with this tea excellent the resealable bags work well , and unopened they protect my large stash , making it easier to manage my subscription . 
i 've used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious , consistently good quality black tea mainly i use it and several other numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha . 
i grew up on yunnan tea as a child it was always my mother 's favorite so i was happy to find an economical source of it of a quality that was great for a large volume habitual tea drinker like me this tea is my daily regular tea yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time it 's aromatic and flavorful without any additives if you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than earl grey this yunnan or a keemun may be a nice option to explore . 
it always amazes me that there are not dozens of reviews here extolling the fine qualities of this tea i have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and i never get tired of it it 's an excellent morning tea , is smooth without being insipid , and is almost impossible to ruin by oversteeping just use decent water i like a little stevia in it , as i'm a wimp it brings out the natural sweetness of its malty , slightly floral style i just bought another two pounds . 
i hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent i decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers it is flavorful without being overpowering it is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced after the first try i have continued to drink it just as it comes you can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea . 
i read the other reviews before purchasing am pleased that i did i have purchased other numi teas and gave generally been happy with all of theri products . 
having eaten \( and re eaten \) my way though all of the das caramel range , this remains my all time favorite , and the one that usually gets the most rave reviews when i share them \( which is n't an easy thing to do just try one and you 'll see what i mean \) i 've been a caramel fan for ages , and while werthers butterscotch will do in a pinch , nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these they are chewy , buttery , and the little crunches of salt are spectacular \( ok my mother did n't put salt in hers , this is an improvement \) . 
although i did enjoy the other flavor i ordered a tiny bit more , the chocolate with walnuts one , this was still a very enjoyable flavor wonderful service from ms das , including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders , along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors i 'd order this or the chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure , along with more of das food 's gourmet salt . 
this is certainly the best caramels i have ever had i just wish it came in bigger pieces i finished the whole box in one sitting ! i will certainly buy them again . 
being an old chemist with a spectrophotometer i am pleased when the chemical is what they say it is this is what they advertized . 
this baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons i take it for acid indigestion and heart burn just a 1 tsp in a half glass of water and it 's gone i use it to make my body more alkaline , so it 's great for changing your ph level in your body ! . 
i recently started using bob 's red mill baking soda i'm very pleased with it 's performance and i can be sure that it is not contaminated with aluminum thanks , bob ! . 
the product is of high quality , and has a rich full flavor br br delivery was unexpectedly fast br br the only negative i would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack while this may be commonplace , a significant improvement would be to have an inner liner of a heavy weight , food grade , plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag could be either a zip lock bag or a twist tie closure does n't make any difference just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it br br this is a health and spoilage issue 50 's of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers \( very expensive and hard to find i am a single senior who likes to buy staple goods in bulk to save money and provide food security long term storage is a big issue with people like me br br thom \( missouri \) . 
i'm happy with the quality of the product and the price like the other reviewer , i would prefer if there was a plastic liner to preserve freshness however , i will continue to buy this product regardless as it is quality oatmeal at a good price br br edit i'm on my 4th bag , quality continues to be high . 
product is fresh , good and i'm not getting complaints anymore br br that 's worth the large quantity and shipping charges br br hey , its oatmeal my favorite ! . 
good quality oats package came on time oats worked well in recipes i will admit , as a single person i bought these oats with my boyfriend for breakfast food it lasted us for the year br br otherwise it 's an excellent buy . 
i looooove pocky , got once at lucky 's and couldnt stop , its like the chocolate is laced with crack anywho , the product is good , the only sad thing is that it was shipped or stored in a hot room and the chocolate melted together partially , but it didnt take too much effort to take apart the sticks br br great product , and great price from this merchant ! . 
of the many purchses i made on amazon this past december , i was most pleased with the pocky chocolate cream covered biscuit sticks \( pack of 10 \) they arrived on time , and they were a 'hit' as a surprised gift be sure to keep them refridgerated . 
got these for my kids as christmas stocking stuffers they love them as far as delivery , the product came in good condition , timely , and was terrific definitely a good buy . 
i'm not sure how you review something that 's as subjective as taste , but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker , you 'll like this \( it does n't taste exactly like either of those , but that 's the closest analogy for me \) the sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind , dipped in chocolate , with one end left just normal cracker to you do n't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating br br here 's some of the nitty gritty details each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets , that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks the packets themselves are really cleverly designed , with a little slit cut in the folded part , you just grab both sides and pull , and it opens up the package without any hassle gotta love japanese product design ! \) another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing side of the stick is right at the top br br each of the packets has 210 calories \( 90 from fat \) , and about 80mg of sodium so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option it does contain milk , wheat , soybeans and sheanut so if any of these are an issue for you , then you 'll want to pass it also says on the packaging that the facility they 're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts the product does n't use either of them , but the disclosure is nice if you 're particularly sensitive to either br br overall a great snack at a great price the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets , so that 's quite a few snacks one note , if you live in a hot climate , do n't order them in the summer because they will melt together \( in shipping \) ! duh ! \) . 
first of all , i love the packaging making it heatproof but it would n't have been a problem because i ordered it it winter and they were freakishly cold i also want to thank veryasia for the free sample of mi goreng it was delicious ! ! ! i now love mi goreng . 
i bought these back in january and never got around to reviewing them i had heard many people rave about a japanese snack called pocky so i figured i would try it out just like the description states , its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate i would n't say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess , well , as long as the chocolate does n't melt anyways , in case anyone is wondering , i ordered from a seller named very asia \( amazon com gp help seller at a glance html \? ie utf8 isamazonfulfilled 0 orderid 103 7071944 5595443 marketplaceseller 1 seller a3jw437i54sei1 \) i believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me \( maybe it had to be imported \) but when it did , it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever i'm definitely considering re stocking on this in the future if i ca n't find a local store br br edit oct 11 , 2012 br br inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase br br so i decided to restock after i could n't fight the craving anymore unfortunately the batch this time was not so good \( ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through amazon prime \) what i received was not the picture shown on the front page \( 2 per pack japanese pocky \) , it was a 1 per pack pocky ish thing from thailand in my opinion , the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back packaging was fine and i ordered in october when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door the sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste , more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate the original japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth , this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth br br personally i like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor i also have terrible self control so i buy things that come in small portions in order to a \) not eat everything at once and b \) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items i can honestly say that i wo n't be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because i and my stomach dislike it so much i wo n't change my original rating because that still holds true for the japanese pocky but if i were to rate only the thailand pocky it would be a 3 the taste is n't terrible but its definitely not to my liking if possible i will be uploading some pictures of what i received . 
bought these for my daughter 's grad party as well as the strawberry she loves these things they 're a great product . 
everyone in our family except one really likes the taste of this it is addicting that includes our 3 year old . 
pocky is just plain fun to eat i discovered these snacks at an anime convention \( though i 'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them \) they are very , very slim sticks of biscuity stuff \( the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels \) that have a charming tiny popping crispness the chocolate flavor , a nice non bitter , non dark , generically pleasing choco taste , seems to be the most popular \( given how fast they sell out at cons \) , but i prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream very nice br br this is by no means a health food \( it 's in the same category as a cookie , it 's got fat and sugar and non healthful ingredients \) but hey , it 's junk food we all know it 's supposed to be occasional and not habitual in the diet unless you 're really prone to binge eating or ca n't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat , 3 of them saturated i would n't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes in fact , just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect br br if you love the flavor of coconut chocolate together \( like almond joy \) try the coconut chocolate ones they 're really so good , oh man hubby says the taste reminds him of the girl scout 'caramel delights cookies which are , in turn , similar to the old yes yes cookies \( from the seventies or so \) br br anyway , if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick looking treats , or seen footage of cute japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats , this is what they were eating \) fun treats br br however , with this crazy hot summer , i 'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall 's cooler weather you might get a sticky , clumped mess of pocky sticks in this deep summer weather \( look for local stores that specialize in japanese anime or manga and they 'll likely carry japanese snacks like these in south florida , tate 's comics has them in a variety of flavors and fresh and not melted \) . 
pocky is an incredibly good snack , but more than that , i was impressed with very asia 's packaging i had stupidly ordered something as easy to melt as chocolate in the dead heat of summer on top of that the package of dessert pocky i ordered in 100 degree weather melted into this liquid goo t t so of course i was expecting all the pocky in my 10 boxes to be melted away , but they took the special care to put the pocky in a box reading protect from heat and my pocky arriving in perfect condition ! \( well , they did stick together just a bit \) i love very asia more than anything now . 
everyone loves pocky and if they say they do n't they are lying lol the pocky arrived in good condition with minimal melting and very few broken pieces . 
these where great couldnt stop eating them br lowest priced anywhere and will buy even more next time br cant say enough about these , they where shipped faster than what i paid to have shipped also br thank you so much . 
i had bought pocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no asian stores i have to shop on the internet the guys in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason for a bit of insanity , search for pocky commercials on youtube ! . 
this was the first peanut free product i bought for my son i thought they were tasty the kids liked them too for some reason they think they are strawberry bars i love the soft texture and the non crumbly state it makes for clean car rides since then they like the apple and chocolate bars the best berry is always left for last amazon has a wonderful price and i just wish it could be a subscribe item . 
my son with multiple food allergies really enjoys these bars i find that they have a good berry taste they also have a nice chewyness . 
i love them not too sweet but just right any allergy free food is great in my book hope non of these ingredients contains corn thats a no no for me too however i dont appreciate the fact that i opened my new box and the cut 1 4 of it off if the size it less then so should the charge this will effect my decision in buying again i am not a toddler i need a real size bar please . 
with all the allergies in our family , these ended up working out great we do n't have any negative reactions to the ingredients and though we do n't buy many pre packaged foods , these work for 'on the go' our family tried several varieties and i prefer the cocoa loco bars they 're almost like a tootsie roll to me though i ca n't eat tootsie rolls , so this is a great substitute for that occasional craving my family prefers the very berry bars because they can eat those when they miss breakfast , need a healthy snack , or my son will take them on his cross country running meets they are very dense and filling not a 'soft bar' and we always eat them while having some liquid to drink at the same time . 
i'm new to food allergies my 6mo son was diagnosed with some severe fa and since he 's still breastfed , i had to drastically alter my diet br br before learning about this brand , i was stuck eating chicken breasts with potatoes for every meal so when i stumbled upon this at my local whole foods , i was very excited to try it br br overall , i really like them it 's got pretty good texture , taste and heft it 's not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box \( which really is n't that big \) br br i know alot of people complain about the size packaging and i agree somewhat but each bar is an ounce and 120 calories on par with many other breakfast bars i like the berry flavor the best , it 's the closest to real , non fa specialty flavor overally , i'm grateful for these bars because now i can tote several in my diaper bag and car and know that when i really need a quick snack , i wo n't be left stranded . 
my son has severe allergies this is an item he loves and is a convenience for me i feel good giving them to him and they taste great ! . 
tasty , convenient bars for people with celiac disease they seem to have gotten smaller over time , but the taste and convenience outweigh the reduction in size \( and the price \) . 
if you are looking for a great gluten free snack you wo n't be sorry you chose this product my favorite flavor is the apple and nut . 
this brand of granola bars are really good the very berry are my favorite however , the bars are almost ridiculously small yeah , we 're gluten free , so our food is a lot more dense than other food , but honestly , can we not have normal sized , good tasting granola bars \? they really are tiny so , the taste is great but the bar is small . 
great taste great ingredients great texture absolutely delicious ! they are a little smaller and you may still be hungry if it is for a meal i give one to my 5 year old son for breakfast and he is still a little hungry for more either that or they taste so good he wants more . 
recently diagnosed a gluten intolerant , i have been looking for products that allow me to resume a semblance of my former life these snack bars fit the bill they have the mouth feel of a traditional snack bar , and a pleasant tart sweet fruit flavor . 
my son loves these fruit bars they are smaller than your typical wheat fruit bars my suggestion it to get your child to like these first before you try the chocolate ones now my son favors them \( chocolate \) ones more than the berry ones . 
if you want a really good snack bar try these , they are healthy and taste as good as any granola bar , but without the gluten ! ! i buy these regularly . 
my brother bought me a pound of this coffee for christmas he told me that weaver was the original roaster for pete 's coffee , he eventually split off and started his own roaster well let me tell you the stuff is delicious ! i 've never been married to a brand of coffee , usually would buy the starbucks 2 5 lb bag at costco , or whatever looked good at trader joes , but weavers is in a class of it 's own i'm subscribing to guarantee i can have this stuff delivered to me regularly try it ! ! . 
this is the best coffee we 've ever had a light taste but very full bodied i was very pleased with the packaging , having it resealable keeps it stay fresher much longer and unlike other brands this construction stays intact i must say you wont be displeased with your purchase , this is a must buy ! . 
this is the best coffee we 've ever had i run the american pavilion in cannes and weaver 's was by far and away our most popular coffee sponsor ! hundreds of people come to the pavilion every day looking for american coffee and they were not disappointed we did a booming business this year ! buy it ! you 'll be so happy you did ! julie . 
for those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white jasmine tea , numi 's flower jewel is worth a look about the size of a gum ball , these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower they are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea br br decorative does not mean tasteless as a white tea , the flavor is mild , but rich and soothing the jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea i have had stronger jasmine teas , but this one is quite balanced and tasty i used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade the white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and do n't get bitter if seeped for long periods br br i must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart , though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf better packaging might solve this br br if you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells , or are entertaining and want a conversation piece , then numi tea flower jewel should be on your short list . 
numi has a winner here with this tea ! my husband , son and i often share this wonderful tea after dinner it is very pleasant and the reason they love it , it does not turn bitter after longer steeping , like other teas do ! . 
the product is all that it says it is which is why i gave it 5 stars however , i do have issues with the product , namely , me and my family members ca n't take the smell the taste is horrible so i put it in a lotion cream and rubbed it on my skin this was a few weeks ago and though i 've since changed my sheets , the scent is still in my bed ultimately , i stopped using it because it made me smell in a way i did not like it smells like an indian spice and while it did n't work for me , scent wise , it may work fine with someone else . 
my twin 10 month old babies treat this one as dessert their first earth 's best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes after water , sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one , followed by apricot puree that 's dessert for them right there after that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour \( not as good as brown rice though \) br br this is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters add apricot puree and there 's really not much one could do to discourage babies after that i recommend this flavor brand br br ingredients per label water , organic sweet potatoes , organic apricot puree , mechanically separated organic chicken , organic brown rice flour br br the rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency , and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice color br br nutrition per label 80 calories , 15 protein , 90 vitamin a , 2 vitamin c , 2 calcium and 6 iron br br this one had the most vitamin a of all earth 's best jars i 've tried i 've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult . 
baby loved this one , but as he has progressed i had to cut this one out because it is too runny and if i have to move the spoon quickly out of the way of his grabby hands , it is all over ! i think they could use a little less water maybe a little more potato to make it more the consistency of the turkey dinner one . 
my little girl ca n't get enough of this ! i like that it is organic and contains fruit , veggies , protein and grains in one tasty meal i wish it came in larger portions since my 10 month old always wants 2 jars . 
its my daughter 's favorite first and foremost for me i love that i can get lentils , there are n't many stage 2 or 3 vegetarian choices . 
i like the earth 's best baby food line because of the organic ingredients amazon has great prices \( especially if you subscribe \) and free delivery to your doorstop , which is convenient when you 're a busy mom my daughter does n't like a lot of baby foods , but will eat this one as other reviewers have stated , it 's a bit runnier that other eb 's stage 2 foods , so i add some oatmeal to it it 's also a bit bland , so i add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up as an added bonus , it works wonders for her digestive tract ! she had problems with constipation for about 2 5 months , sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository , and then i discovered that this food makes her poop every time \( i also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber \) i rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken i wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein . 
this is my son 's favorite dinner ! best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein \( 21 \) , vitamin a \( 100 \) and c \( 30 \) it is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it love love love this brand and flavor i think i purchased 50 jars so far . 
i do n't know how everyone else got these broken , but when i received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap , not a single jar was broken my son loves them and the price was great and i had no issues at all . 
i would love to say that i have the time to make my son 's food everyday its not the case honestly , i do make it most of the time , but some days , you just do n't have the time energy to get it all done enter this product before i bought this baby food , i read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it , its like a dessert , yadda yadda yadda the truth is , is that yes , it has a bit of fruit in it , but its not sweet at all the fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you do n't have to add anything else its a great product to enter proteins into baby 's diet the consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal to it also , baby will not choke on it i highly recommend . 
we love earth 's best organic baby food , but this is not the tastiest one i 've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross but my daughter still eats it , just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors it 's got a decent amount of protein , which is important for us as a vegetarian family . 
soft smooth texture my little one devours this one it is one of the best meat veg dinners we have found ! . 
my daughter was not a big fan of baby food , especially any with proteins , but she did love this one ! the flavor is just right , not too sweet or too savory , and does n't have a strong chicken flavor almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp , thus it 's a very good first protein to offer , and good for picky eaters my nephews and my niece also liked this flavor , so it 's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you do n't know a particular baby 's preferences br something i wish i had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other stage 2 earth 's best , especially for having chicken i added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture , and she liked that just fine , but it is an extra step however the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging texture problems . 
this is the only food my daughter will eat consistly she really enjoys it the packaging is great never had any broken \( having ordered 4 times \) . 
my son loves the rice and lentil jars it 's not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars i have it on order with subscribe and save amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged . 
i have twin girls , they both loved the vegetable turkey dinner it was one of their favorite baby foods great price . 
my son really enjoys earth 's best lentil ! he eats the entire jar for dinner and always wants more the product shipped very quickly . 
i love the fact that there is turkey being offered this is my son 's 2nd favorite dish no issues with it and a good balance of nutrients . 
this is one of my son 's favorite baby foods it does have a bit of sweetness , but not too sweet it 's more runny than some of the other flavors , so we use a deeper spoon with this one , or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up . 
for whatever reason , our son really likes this flavor i'm not a fan myself , but i'm not the one eating it any time i can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting , i'm a happy mom . 
the rice and lentil dinner is our son 's absolute favorite i do n't know why but he gobbles this up every time he enjoys most of the earth 's best foods and we have only found a couple he does n't eat \( anything with too much apple \) which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination some of the varieties tend to be too runny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar . 
my 7 1 2 month old absolutely loves this one by far , it is her favorite jarred baby food i like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food , and i'm not ready to introduce her to meats yet br br i do subscribe save , which brings the price down to 0 80 jar that 's a fair price not an amazing deal , but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store the bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find i have to go to whole foods my regular grocery store and target carry earth 's best , but not this blend my daughter likes it so much , though , that i would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices it 's a good one ! . 
i always try the food before i feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good my daughter loves it she gets all excited when i make it for her . 
from 6 month to 12 month , my son barely ate any solid food he was so picky we tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he 'd actually finish the whole jar i did n't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it , but i guessed it wrong br now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater his current favorite seems to be tofu , but he still loves corn , zucchini , brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this i highly recommend to try this baby food br br also , earth 's best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well my son does n't really like any snacks from gerber brand , but he likes most of the products from earth 's best their foods taste great \( even for us adult \) and so good for you too . 
this tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too he 's constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these there is absolutely nothing bad to say about these i know some people have complained about the poor packaging but i believe that must 've been fixed b c i 've not had any problems at all in fact , they securely bubble wrap these , then place them in an air cushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time . 
i have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review , but they like all the flavors , the textures are great , and the jars open easily great on the go snack . 
my son started eating this when he was around 8 months old he 's now 14 months old and it 's one of his favorites unfortunately , they do n't carry it at the local grocery store \( they carry other varieties of earth 's best just not this one or his other favorites , spinach potatoes and spaghetti with cheese \) they do carry it at some of the whole foods so i buy them there i'm so glad to find them on amazon ! i get tired of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the store br br we use this as a base and mix in other things bits of cooked broccoli , small pieces of meat i 've also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors . 
my baby loves rice and lentil and is one of her favorite things to eat if we are going somewhere i wo n't be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold . 
my daughter loved this stuff it is all natural and made very well good to mix with other things as they get older too ! beats gerber . 
my daughter is outgrowing baby food but will still eat this we tried 3rd foods on her and she does n't like the texture of them this is really good for her and she likes it , so we keep buying it . 
my son loves the best earth 's baby food and his favorite seems to be the vegetable and turkey he smiles at every mouthful br br i would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way all the food i feed my son is through earth 's best . 
my six month old baby loves the earth 's best 2nd sweet potato chicken dinner it 's his favorite he seems to love all the earth 's best 2nd foods fruits , vegetables , and dinners the consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat not too thick , not too thin . 
the earths best he eats the most , this one is a little thicker than his original chicken sweet potato favorite which is very runny . 
i 'd continue to buy but i'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars shattered too many they like all the flavors though great textures too . 
i did n't eat any but my baby liked it she said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in tuscany also i like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste i just learned this and am telling everyone only glass recycles forever and if you do n't recycle then you and i have nothing in common and you should stop reading here it 's not even a hard thing to do anymore nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy you just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day stop being lazy . 
pretty good product the taste is n't the best but it 's definitely not the worse either it gives a pretty smooth energetic kick . 
i am a true seattle coffee addict , and i have never had a better coffee candy . 
sent this basket to my father for his birthday he said the fruit was very fresh and sweet happy with this healthy purchase ! . 
this fruit gift really was the perfect gift ! everything was fresh , well packed and tasty looking ! and the people that received it assured me that it was quite tasty tasting too and tried the chocolate covered cherries ad was surprised at how delicious they were ! so thank you ! i needed something in a pinch and it came even earlier than expected ! so thank you again ! dharana , san francisco . 
i got it for my girlfriend for her birthday the fruit actually tasted fresh and yummy ! i love dark chocolate , so i loved the dark chocolate almonds next time i 'll give the organic version of this product to someone close so they share with me \) . 
as a child my facorite memory was drinking sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my granddad i have never seen it in a tea bag before i found that to get the taste i remember i needed 2 bags per cup the bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that i will buy again and again plus the shipping time was great . 
i grew up in ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful i would dig tender roots or bark a few trees for a delightful tea i purchased breezy morning sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product not a good bargain i switched to pappy 's extract . 
i ordered this on line and received it in just a few days \( 3 \) the tea is excellent and the price was right for me . 
i purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present , she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time , i did n't realize it was so hard to find ! she absolutely loves it , made a great surprise christmas gift . 
i heard some great things about sassafras and wanted to try it i was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated i'm actually gonna order the 4 pack and continue drinking it over time do n't trust the fda ! ! . 
bought this for my dad for about 2 years he would complain to be about how he has n't had this tea since he was about 9 finally , after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed , i bought him the tea so he 'd shut up . 
great tasting tea i have been looking for a good sassafras tea forever finally i will be ordering this product again br thanks kim d . 
i love panang curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it so decided to try making my own , and with this product , i get exactly what i want , hot tasty panang curry adding lots of fresh veggies , tofu and brown rice and it 's very hot , did n't have to add any spices at all great product , will purchase again . 
best paste i have tried ! so easy to use just saute you meat , add veggies , paste , and a tin of coconut milk quick and tasty ! i am on weight watchers and tried using the light coconut milk instead of the full fat it works for the panang paste especially if you add a heaping tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter but the yellow , green , and red are spicy and need the full fat coconut milk to balance it out . 
this gravy mix is excellent except , do n't use water where called for , use milk instead , and it makes it 100 better ! ! . 
i'm not from the south , but live in sofla where sometimes we get a southern influence the gravy mix i am reviewing , pioneer country gravy is de licious ! ! ! i 've tried others publix brand , mc cormick , ect , but this is the best ! by far ! i chose to mix 1 2 water 1 2 milk , 2 cooked , chopped sausage links , and it was phenomenal on my bisquick cheese garlic bisquits \( like red lobster 's \) , served with a small side of watercress scrambled eggs it 's super easy to make and thick ! finger lickin ! mmmmmmm i heard you can put it on potatoes veggies and chicken , make soups and add for seasoning pioneer brand as the name says is a homestyle , american classic ! . 
nothing easier nothing better even beats grandmother 's white gravy recipe already peppered for you you do nothing but mix it with water takes only a minute or two i highly recommend this gravy mix it will not disappoint . 
i have used pioneer gravy for a number of years it is very easy to make and tastes great , also goes very well over mashed potatoes , meats , etc try it ! . 
its great to be able to get sugar this way its not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body , and i am helping the fair trade farmers it is a good thing all around i am happy i can get it in amazon . 
i am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because i never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar i really enjoy the starbucks via instant coffee but i drink so much , it is rather expensive so i thought i would give this a try both my wife and i were pleasantly surprised with the taste i do n't think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable i bought my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about 7 that seemed a little high but i figured i would check online to find the best price as i started calculating all of the online prices , they are charging about 7 bucks for the 19 count i would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper so you do n't have to do the math 7 38 184 per single online price 27 114 236 \( shipping not calculated in \) looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier , you can get a case of 12 boxes for 69 , no sales tax and free shipping sounds like a great deal \? \? 12 x 19 228 singles so 69 228 302 per single the most expensive at all . 
i do n't think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh brewed coffee , but they taste far better than instant coffee at work , we have a water cooler with hot water dispenser this brewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee i highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but do n't have access to a coffee maker individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning meetings . 
i keep regular bags and decaf bags in my home at all times br never have to drink old coffee best way to make iced coffee . 
i live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this especially when i need to stay up late to study or to wake up after 2 hours of sleep its just like making tea and tastes decent enough not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream . 
my primary point with this review is to note that this packaging is less expensive than the other size offered by folger you get more coffee for less money br br i recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years since i did n't know how many cups a day i would use , i wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker i do n't particularly like instant coffee i was delighted to find these folger 's bags br br they brew a very nice tasting cup of coffee i'm not any kind of coffee expert , so i do n't know what special terms might be used all i know is that if i let the bag seep for a bit more than a minute , it sure tastes good thanks to my very much better half , i 've also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffee br br very convenient , very easy , very tasty i intend to take some of these with me when i travel as an alternative to the in room coffee makers or \( yeck ! \) vending machines br br jerry . 
we ca n't have any kind of coffee maker at work , so we 're forced to buy at the in house coffee shop or starbuck 's across the street in this economy , no one wants to pay those high prices , so we started a coffee club 20 of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh , hot , tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices thanks folgers ! ! ! . 
these are great for at work , just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee this is the best tasting coffee it 's easy to make without a mess . 
fast , easy and definitely delicious makes a great cup of coffee and very easy to make good purchase will continue to order from here br thanx . 
i gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit and i'm glad i did it has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma it has a nice reddish color this tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea i 've had , and i look forward to experiencing any of the purported health benefits of rooibos that i 've read about . 
i tried this before having normal red tea so i waited to review the flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity the color is that of muddy water , and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well well worth every penny . 
i previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price i decided to give pure matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive the quality of pure matcha 's products surpasses that of all others i have tried stays fresh , has a consistent texture and tastes great both the quality and price are better than others that i have purchased for the same quantity i highly recommend pure matcha and will continue to purchase . 
this is the very best marinade you can buy as far as i am concerned of course , everyone to his or her own tastes , but all in all , i think anyone will like it i give it five stars . 
this is a great product for those looking for an msg and gluten free product , and is also lower sodium than any other marinade or soy sauce out there ! it does n't compromise of taste either , i use it as a soy sauce substitute and have found it to have superior taste and it looks and acts just like any good marinade should if you are celiac or gluten intolerant , or even just watching you salt intake , this product is a way to have your steak and marinade it too ! . 
my poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try and br our family really enjoyed it i looked at the ingredients and was quite pleased br with the natural ingredients and no calories . 
this hot sauce is one of my favorites its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy you can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle a mix of garlic , habanero , and other spices i put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week i highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce . 
i was never much of a hot sauce fan until i tasted black market hot sauce i was listning to the radio one morning and the creater owner was giving an interview , it sounded interesting the d j 's were sampling the sauce and raving about it , so i picked up a bottle at the local grocery , it 's so good ! i keep a bottle in the kitchen and an extra bottle on hand for gifts and for taking to potlucks , barbecues and party 's happy to see i can buy it online at amazon . 
this is my favorite hot sauce ! i liketo use it to give anything some extra flavor i have loved going out to some of my favorite resturants in town and seeing that they are offering this great product i really enjoy putting on my my breakfast burritos ! . 
they have this in a local diner that i eat in regularly i use it on all kinds of foods and i love it it 's hot , but not without flavor i do n't like those sauces that just burn but have no taste this has both burn and and awesome flavor i was surprised to find it on amazon \( just stumbled across it \) i would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good hot sauce . 
i was browsing around on amazon looking for gifts and was very pleased to see my favorite sauce on here i will just order and have shipped to my friends habanero is my favorite , i love the heat and the tangy spiciness i also love the pineapple you will not go wrong ordering this up . 
this is my favorite hot sauce i buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy ! my favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce ! . 
so far i have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing my fiance and i use them nearly daily and i just picked up 3 more it goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick br br the sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears it is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use we love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice . 
absolutely love the habenaro sauce use it on eggs , sandwiches most anything for a good kick ! have watched the progessing popularity of theis homegrown product have nothing but the highes accolades for the chef and the product get out there and try it ! . 
black market hot sauce is wonderful my husband loves this habenero sauce , its very very flavorful with a nice kick to it i in fact love the medium sauce the taste is so yummy with a bit of zing behind it we used it for everything and you can use it with any meal br br i like the fact that there are so many different levels of spicyness we love the medium habenero kind of like a his hers package thank you for your hard work guys ! keep up the hard work . 
man what can i say , this salsa is the bomb ! ! i have all the different kinds i have it with almost every meal the owner is a cool dude , he 's dropped off free bottles to me in my mailbox i stole the first bottle out of a friends fridge after i tasted and been hooked since dont sleep on this hot sauce ! ! . 
this sauce is so good with just about anything , i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles , it has a good burn with a strong flavor im hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon buy it you wont regret it . 
i never in my life tasted such a good babka its crazy good ! this is the real babka ! that my gram mother use to make . 
i am so convinced these are human animal crackers they look and taste exactly like human ones \( yes , i tasted it \) and they contain sugar , which is not one of the last ingredients in the nutrition facts either so ill just give my dog very small amounts . 
i have a whole box of peanut butter dog cookies and she wont touch them she loves these and begs for them so it was a good buy she is a little chihuhua and they are not too big for her mouth about 20 per box . 
my chihuahua loves these lil snacks when she sees me bring out the yellow bus she literally runs in circles ! . 
i purchased these little treats as stocking stuffers for our little furry friends both yorkies loved these treats we had to finally buy more since they liked them so much . 
these are just like the animal crackers we eat the price is great and my little guy loves them ! . 
i tried this and i found it too salty br plus i ate this fish sauce with some fish but i realized it was kind of redundant br br i'm kidding , of course this stuff is great ! . 
i do n't usually drink tea but i love this one i thought the shipping price was a little high but love the tea so much that i had to get it perfect with a little bit of honey . 
cavenders makes the best vinegar and oil dressing ever couple of tbls of cavenders and 1 4 vinager and 1 4 h2o , rest oil good ! . 
it 's balanced , it 's tasty , it 's filling , it 's good for you what more could you ask of a breakfast cereal \? br br i still miss kellogg 's sister product , just right , which was a somewhat lighter blend \( i loved it , they discontinued it \) , but mueslix is a strong second best . 
do n't know why i ca n't find these in my supermarket but i ca n't you get pack of 5 when you order was afraid 5 boxes would last too long instead found i need to order another 5 pack . 
i bought this product online because , although it is a kellogg cereal , i cannot find a retail store which carries it , and incidentally i would like to know why i called kellogg and they could really give me no good answer , and suggested i try another product of theirs , which i found not as good as this i appreciate that amazon offers this , and i will continue to order it by the way , it really keeps me regular , better than any other cereal try it , you 'll like it . 
this cereal is difficult to find in the stores so i appreciate being able to purchase it through amazon my husband really likes it and looks forward to the delivering of it every month seems like an unlikely thing to look forward to , but it 's the little things that count p looney . 
you could find this in local supermarkets about 4 months ago but now it nowhere to be found every time kellogg 's makes a great cereal , they quit making it soon after this is the case with just right , that was the best stuff on the planet ! . 
this has been my favorite cereal for probably 20 years the grocery stores stopped selling it , so i 've started buying it on the web in packs of 5 boxes i use them up pretty fast . 
i love this cereal not only does it taste good , it's good for you it's a pity that i can't find this cereal in any of the local supermarkets other brands do not match up . 
have been enjoying mueslix since early '90s some reason , i can not locate mueslix in local supermarkets in new york , so i order through amazon taste is perfect not so sweet i do not care too much about raisins but in this cereal i do enjoy greatly it is enjoyable way to supplement fibers with whole grain , a perfect breakfast that lasts until lunch time ! tried all different kind choices of many cereals out there but there is nothing like mueslix . 
amazon 's price may be higher than some grocery stores , but it is n't in my store so this is a good way to shop br i first tried this on a princess cruise ship i found it is very good and filling it stays with me , which is very important br i am super please to find this ! . 
i almost ca n't stop eating this cereal i eat it for breakfast and then in the evening , when i think i want something to eat and am really not hungry , i snack on these after all , it 's healthy , so long as i remembeer it 's not healthy to eat a cup or more enjoy ! . 
our local stores all stopped carrying this product and were putting their own imitation brands on the shelf just not the same ! great that i could order and have my cereal within days ! . 
mueslix has been my favorite cereal since it came out years ago however , they have \( improved \? \? \? \? \) it by adding more raisins and nuts to the point of making it too rich ! i simply add about half of a grain cereal , such as cornflakes which also reduces the high price stores keep discontinuing mueslix to the point that it is hard to find ! thank you amazon ! . 
this cereal is hard to find in local stores where i live my wife and i love this cereal for its taste and healthfulness whenever i find it in some hotel breakfast buffets , i am a happy man i cannot think of eating any other cereal . 
kellogg 's mueslix had replaced local muesli previously served in european b b 's on our last trip not available locally , but amazon provided with a fair price , rapid delivery and no shipping cost with my prime shipping excellent form of muesli ! . 
eating healthy never tasted so good tough to find in my local stores but amazon has it at a great price especially through subscribe and save . 
the kelloggs muselix are delicious and the delivery was quick a href http www amazon com gp product b001e6kbsk kellogg 's crispy blend mueslix raisins , dates almonds , 15 3 ounce unit \( pack of 5 \) a . 
this cereal is the best cereal on the market it has many flavors , including nuts , raisins , dates , and especially a light malt flavor i have enjoyed it most mornings for years . 
i have been eating kellogg 's mueslix for years i love the mix of fruit , almonds , and whole grain it used to be easy to find but when i could n't find it in my local super markets , i was afraid it had been discontinued when i found it on amazon , i was pretty happy . 
it was a sad moment when i was unable to find my favorite cereal in the grocery stores i'm not sure why it disappeared , but am so grateful i'm able to purchace this online thanks ! . 
its hard to find in the us my husband frm jamaica and he loves it he says it makes him fill full all day i get it every mo . 
my mom who is in now new york , in an assisted living facility love 's this ceral she was buying kellogg 's mueslix when she lived in florida , but when i went to buy it for her in ny where she is , i had no luck i called kellogg 's themselves and they directed me to amazon com i was so please that they sold the ceral and i can have it shipped for free to her i also save money on each box and i also do not have to pay for the shipping so now you have two happy people , my mom who gets her favorite ceral shipped directly every few months \( they send 5 boxes \) and me for saving money and time shopping and shipping the package to my mom . 
i have been struggling to find them in the shops nearby br much more convenient to order them through amazon \( slightly more expensive , but i save the gas and the burden \) . 
the kellogg mueslix cereal was ordered one evening and just a couple of days later it arrived the item was well packed contents were fresh encountered no problems br and plan to use this resource again . 
local grocery stores do n't carry this cereal so i order it it is full of nuts , raisins , and other great stuff i cut up a banana in it instead of adding sugar my favorite box cereal . 
just got the baby back ribs and the strips of jerky out of the smoker , wow this seasoning really added a lot of flavor , what was surprising was the fact that i knew i had added to much seasoning but it did n't turn out over powering i would recommend this to anyone who is cooking any kind of meat , the jerky is great , but the ribs are outstanding , and for 27 including shipping for 12lbs , awesome deal . 
i try every asian salad dressing i can find br this is my favorite one for salads because of it 's delicate taste br my other favorite is newman 's own , low fat sesame ginger br the ginger in newman 's gives it a stronger flavor which is great br as a marinade or just sprinkle on rice and vege dishes . 
wow , this is soooo good and has easily become my favorite dressing ! i typically make my own dressings , however i do use this one as a treat ! br br it was given to me as a gift and i absolutely love it ! it 's a perfect balance of sweet and oily and bitter granted , it needs a good shaking since it 's oil based ! i absolutely love this and am sad i am running out ! if you eat salads like me every day , then you will want this dressing ! it 's unique and i never had somebody over who did n't love it ! \) . 
this coffee company delivers on great coffee taste ! ! i like my coffee with deep , robust taste and jeremiah 's always is ! ! it makes me glad to purchase it ! ! thanks ! ! . 
this is a cute product to use in place of sprinkles the bright colors of candy coating look great , and the chocolate center keeps them from being overly sweet br br however this price is roughly double what you pay at michael 's \( or marshall 's , when they stock stuff like this \) plus you can get the same product but in a 16 oz bag on amazon here http www amazon com ck products rainbow candy coated dp b00375lao0 ref sr 1 1 \? ie utf8 s home garden qid 1300131716 sr 1 1 comes with prime shipping too ! . 
i actually gave these to a local baker for my daughters cupcakes they looked great showed up perfectly on white and chocolate icing in great shape . 
this is the first time i 've used the coconut oil from manila coco factory and i was so pleased with the taste , smell and overall incredible quality that i will buy more and recommend it to my family and friends i am so glad i tried it i have been using coconut oil for several years and it has changed my life and health this oil ranks high in my book also , i liked ordering this product through amazon because they make it fast , easy and painless thank you for having this product on your site amazon . 
i ordered the white christmas , christmas eve , and christmas morning blends last year for the holidays and fell in love with the christmas eve it 's the smoothest of the bunch and has such a wonderful flavor , i use it for iced teas all year round i can honestly say that i never got into tea that much until i tried stash teas i sent the licorice and lemon flavors to my father , and he called me to ask where i 'd gotten it , because his neighbor wanted to get some for his wife , too once tried , you will be addicted visit the stashtea website for lots of tea related bits and baubles these make perfect hostess gifts over the holidays along with a plate of cookies . 
this is my very favorite tea of all i drink it year round and never get tired of it like i do of others it 's good any time of the day not too strong , but still nicely flavorful , with a good balance of minty spicy herbal y . 
christmas eve tea \( which does not actually contain tea \) is not just for christmas eve \( although if you are frazzled , it does releave the stress \) christmas eve is good any time i do not know anyone who does n't like it , and have often given it as gifts it is especially nice in the winter when mint teas are a little too brisk and do not produce the same level of cozy comfort as christmas eve which is a soothing combination of spices and mint it is almost as comforting as a cup of warm milk , but without the calories . 
riba foods based in houston , texas makes this awesome black bean dip it is pretty much all natural and without the lard that regular refried bean dip has in it i am not sure why in dallas tx it 's so hard to find maybe because riba has so many good flavors \? \? \? i make the traditional 7 layer dip with this instead of the refried beans , and am thinking about creating a breakfast quesadilla with this and some verde sauce try it , it 's not too too spicy but is very good ! . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b001gcvlxg walkers shortbread highlander shortbread portion pack , 1 4 ounce units \( pack of 24 \) a br my family loves these ! it 's a great 'snack' to carry in the car or it 's a wonderful surprise in a lunchbag the flavor is so rich and pure i forgot how wonderful these shortbread cookies were and the price is nice , too as well as amazon com i love this place ! . 
walker 's highlanders are my favorite purchased cookie , so it was great to find them pre packaged into 2 biscuits keeps them fresh longer and limits my snacking ! . 
if you like shortbread you will really like these walkers always makes the best shortbread br a href http www amazon com gp product b001gcvlxg walkers shortbread highlander shortbread portion pack , 1 4 ounce units \( pack of 24 \) a . 
couldn't find these anywhere but on line it was worth the wait because they are trully great tasting cookies . 
yes , these cubes are expensive in fact , i almost gave them four stars for the expense regardless , these sugar cubes are my favorite sugar product i 've tried every brown sugar and cane sugar product you can find on amazon and in your grocery store , and none of them compare to the rich , sweet , unique flavor of the brown sugar cubes by la perruche because i 've tried so many brown sugar products , i believe the difference is the terroir , or the ground land , where this sugar is grown la perruche sugar cubes are made from african grown sugar more specifically , sugar grown in swaziland and or the congo also , the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes i do n't know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished , but the cubes are not regularly sized , but are large and irregularly shaped , and heavier sturdier than cut cubes by other producers br br the flavor is a rich , distinct and more molasses y flavor than other brown sugar cubes , and is somewhat darker as well i wish i could describe the flavor better , but it has been several months since i was able to find a somewhat affordable supply btw , now that this product is being sold with free shipping via amazon prime , i just purchased several boxes it is a much better deal as of the date of this review than it was a few months ago recommended ! . 
we love these sugar cubes in the office they are n't your grandmother 's sugar cube they have a rugged appearance \( can sugar cubes be considered rugged \) and we combine them with the white sugar cubes from la perruche . 
love this for espressos the raw sugar cube is not as sweet as the refined sugars and more rich in flavor . 
due to my husband 's and son 's inability to eat gluten , cornstarch is used very frequently in many gluten free recipes i am very concerned with the prolific use of gmos in corn especially and my family 's increased consumption of it i wanted to find an affordable gmo free cornstarch product to use in all my baking rumford natural cornstarch is the one ! i 've been using it for months now with great success satisfaction . 
if you love garlic , i recommend this flavored oil it is true to its name i was not expecting it to be so strong , so if i use it for cooking or dipping bread , i will mix it with some unflavored olive oil in the future . 
these things are awesome perfect size , truly wafer thin , consistent thickness of dark chocolate over minty interior they are like what would happen if you could run a steamroller over a junior mint i first tried them when i was living in germany 16 years ago , and to this day no other mint comes close and the copycat ones \? disgusting go for the original you wo n't regret it each mint is in its own sleeve , so you can pass them out without ever touching one elegant and delicious love them ! . 
love these mints they melt in your mouth and taste better than any others i have tried just wish they were n't so expensive you ca n't eat just one , a couple they are addictively delicious . 
i got it for my girlfriend very good stuff now everybody in the house eats them very hight quality if you are into chocolate and mint . 
a friend 's favorite candy is after eight , but they are not available anywhere in my area i could n't find them on line either amazon com came through these are imported from england and the most delicious peppermint these are so thin with a smooth mint cream center and a dark chocolate shell if you just want a little taste of mint , this is for you really special with a cup of hot coffee ! . 
nature 's recipe is now a division of that mega company del monte foods br br the test br br the neat thing about this food is that it really does look like the photograph on the bag it consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in when the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of farm selects unmixed and readily took to it since then they 've been eating it mixed with their blue food br br i thought evie and piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there , but they do n't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind br br the quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list only one ingredient , that animal digest , makes me cringe a little the girls do n't mind it a bit for goodness alone i can heartily recommend this natural food , but the price on it is relatively high rachel ray 's dry dog food , for example , is about half the price of farm stands selects , and buffalo blue is about the same price for a household like ours with three dogs , the farm stands selects is too pricey to feed the girls exclusively we 'd feel obliged to mix another good , but less expensive food with it for those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue , i say you ca n't go wrong with farm selects . 
you will not find a better loose green tea for the price i was able to get free shipping as well since i bought it with something else that totaled over 25 this is the tea used by many japanese people do not fall for those high priced organic green teas produced by american companies they are good but you are not getting anything better than hime ban cha tea . 
this is the favorite green tea in our household been using it for years was happy to find it here on amazon , otherwise we had to travel about forty miles to an oriental grocery store to purchase it ca n't even buy any leaf tea of any kind in regular grocery stores any more by the way ban cha in japan simply means common or everyday tea not ceremonial . 
i love this tea ! ! it is so flavorful yet there is no cut grass or off flavor as with some green teas it is so mild that even left steeping it does not become bitter it has a very mellow flavor that my kids enjoy too it 's great without sweeteners br it is a loose leaf tea and when steeped the leaves unfurl , long and slender a little tea goes a long way enjoy ! . 
i have been drinking this green tea for sometime and was purchasing it when i was going to syracuse every summer this year i stopped going there and did n't know where i was going to buy my tea until i spotted it on amazon and purchased it i was so pleased that i could get it , so i am now a happy camper once again . 
this is the real deal genmai cha loose green tea and roasted brown rice not in bags originally known as the peoples tea for those who could n't afford better very popular because of its mild flavor you can drink it all day long \( like i do \) you wo n't be disappointed . 
gatorade g2 is the way to go when you want the benefits of gatorade without quite so much sugar as i am in a pre diabetes state these days , i am drinking this type of gatorade instead of the regular gatorade which has noticeably more sugar in it the really good thing is that this still replenishes carbs and electrolytes after i exercise without putting unnecessary extra sugar into my system br br g2 comes in flavors including fruit punch and grape br br if you 're on the go , the advantage of these bottles of gatorade is this because the bottles are smaller you can carry them with you much easier than if you took the regular , larger size bottles of gatorade g2 br br i highly recommend this drink if you need extra carbs or electrolytes after exercising it replenishes them very well without the extra sugar found in regular gatorade . 
my partner is very happy with the tea , and is feeling much better since starting to drink it br she has been drinking it both hot \( normal \) and iced \( chilled \) and likes the refreshing nature of it . 
this tea won an award in the usa and i know why mandarin silk loose leaf oolong tea is like the name suggests silk silk on your tongue a tea that has a warm , relaxing taste that makes you feel wonderful well done art of tea ! . 
these are identical to jay 's hot chips \( are they made by the same company \? \) they have a slightly sweet taste , with a nice bit of heat definately not overwhelming heat , on a heat scale of 1 5 , i would give these about a 2 regarding the texture , these are not kettle cooked chips , so they do not have much crunch , they are comparable to regular lays chips for about 1 a bag , they are a great deal . 
i first had these uncle ray 's chips a few years ago while traveling out west i tracked them down on amazon and recognized the name they are just as good as i remember smoky sweet with just enough kick , and there 's adequate seasoning on all of the chips each bag also has a little story , courtesy of uncle ray , that usually has some moral message or anecdote they are pretty funny , but not intentionally my only problem with these chips is their texture they 're a bit thin , and there 's not much of a crunchy texture otherwise , these are good chips and well worth trying out . 
i am from michigan but have a vacation home in canada i have always been a fan of the primarily canadian product ketchup chips uncle rays is a brand i 've seen around there frequently since this is such a hard to find product i expected to pay big bucks to buy it online imagine my surprise when i found these chips on amazon for a little over a dollar a bag cheaper than the retail i would pay in canada unbelievably delicious ! ps the dill pickle chips are really good too \) . 
mine came with stickers to sell them for 1 59 but they cost more like 1 25 so if for retail that is not much of a mark up i bought these for myself so that does n't really matter and they are cheap similar to lay 's but cheaper unlike other knockoffs these seemed to taste fresher and the convenient size minimizes stale chips great product great price . 
i'm not a potato chip addict , but sometimes like them as a snack br br i chose these because i 'd never tried them before br br they are delicious , zesty , slightly sweet and spicy it 's like a combination of sweet and tart at once the oils in these chips are better for health it is hard to put the bag down br br they are made in detroit michigan and contain no trans fats , that 's good enough for me try them . 
these are some of my favorite chips on the planet ! they are light , crisp , not too greasy the flavor is very dilly love that ! great chips just hard to find . 
these chips are really good they taste better than other name brands they 're cheaper too ! ! they are n't too salty like other brands the flavors blend really well just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in once i start eating them , it 's hard to stop ! ! lol br br i will definitely be buying these potato chips rather than another name brand not sure if i can state the name brand or not \) . 
not as thick as kettle chips we have had in the past , definitely more like a potato chip and the college crowd loves it interestingly enough they feel more 'gourmet' when eating these the flavor is not heavily garlic while you can easily taste the cheese . 
i thought they were very good chips , delicious ! and as soon as i run out , i 'll be ordering more very soon . 
these are hard to find , but worth the trouble very tasty and very reasonably priced love the product , and received very quickly . 
i love uncle ray 's potatoe chips they have alot of spice on each chip they taste spicy with a tang of sweet when i order a box , i pass them out to friends who love them my husband , my kids and i eat a whole bag at a time i limit myself to ordering only twice ayear the salt content makes me blow up , but i still love them . 
i love old dutch ketchup chips but they are no where to be found in the us and pricey on ebay i tried herr 's but they were dull very ketchupy but not the tangy vinigary ketchup bite that old dutch has \( makes your mouth hurt in a good way if you eat too many ! \) uncle rays are decent more of a kick many loaded chips which i like , still , not the addictive bite i love so if you love herr 's these may be too much for you if you love old dutch give these a shot i am still on my quest for something equal to old dutch ! ! . 
i confess , i was originally looking at a different name brand , but they were out of the salt and vinegar , which is the only flavor i eat i had never even heard of uncle ray 's , let alone tried them , but the price was reasonable and it helped me qualify for free super saver shipping i am happy to say i was very pleasantly surprised with these chips somehow or another , even though they just seem to be in a normal box , when i opened that first bag i had a nice mix of big chips and little chips the salt and vinegar blend well , so much so that the flavors sometimes sneak up on you it sometimes seems that with the first crunch you taste salt and the second crunch gives the vinegar in any case , they 're terrific i was a little reluctant about buying a somewhat large quantity of an unknown product , but i'm very glad i took the chance . 
it 's difficult to purchase no salt potato chips at most retail stores , so i ordered a case of 3 ounce bags of uncle rays they are great not oily and they taste great you get the potato flavor instead of just salt i 'll be buying these from now on ! . 
we can rarely find these potato chips where we live , so i decided to find them online to satisfy our cravings we cannot be happier with the ordering from amazon ! the chips arrived fast and in a box that protected them from crushing excellent and will be ordering again ! . 
i have now tried both the ocean fish and tuna and the duck and chicken variety of this food my cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better , but i will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he 's gotten \( especially from the ocean fish and tuna \) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding also , with this food , he does n't drink much water , but still goes potty alot , so i feel good that he 's getting plenty of fluids in his diet my only complaint with this brand , and why i only give it 4 stars , is that it has little pieces of potato \? and whole peas in it , which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful , which i do n't like given the price not that big of a deal , but it is a minor inconvenience that i have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily \( in case you are wondering , it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea 1 5 pea size potato \? bits per 1 4 to 1 2 can \) . 
who does n't like vegetables that are portable and at a great price \? ca n't beat the convenience at about 4 cents per package ! . 
everything americolor that i have purchased works great ! i was looking for some lighter tone colors , everything i had was pretty bright these sheen colors are light with a pretty sheen , it 's great ! thank you ! . 
i love the metallic and sheen colors in a photo , the items airbrushed with the silver and gold look real the sheen really kicks the color up a notch . 
ordered these for my daughters wedding cake overnight so that i would get them the next day br they came four days after wedding br but they are nice . 
as soon as i opened the teabag envelope , the smell was truly divine nasal candy \) as good as the bag and the lingering scent on the envelope smelled , the tea proved to be rather bitter i may have steeped it too long , so will see if the bitterness abates steeping less however , as i prefer milk or cream products in flower teas , the bitterness was soon dispelled with a little soy creamer and an enjoyable cup was had lychee is truly a wonderful flavor for tea i suspect the flowers added to this lychee tea may contribute to the bitterness in the straight tea will definitely reorder . 
if you 're looking at choice tea , you 're probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic , fair trade ingredients for tea br br but choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations as for design , lychee white is part of choice 's new line , characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramid shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves as for creative ingredient combinations , this healthy white tea is enhanced by the ethereal marriage of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic osmanthus blossoms the flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate . 
sent very prompty , tea is delicious , will continue to use this company with great enthusiasm . 
i loved this tea ! it is refreshing and delicious with or without sweetener a great buy ! i would definitely recommend this product ! . 
3 boxes , under 6 each for all cherry great buy i could n't find all cherry in the store and do n't really care for the other flavors . 
almost 150 charms blow pops for less the 10 cents each these are great for bribing my children and a trip down memory lane . 
this salsa is definitely one for the books ! ! a perfect blend of the jolokia pepper and seasonings that made this the perfect dip for half time grown men crying because it 's soooo hot is a small price to pay for this awesomeness in a jar perfect for my cream cheese dip too ! a across the board . 
this salsa was delicious it was very spicy as i'm sure you 've guessed , but was also pretty dang tasty it was a bit sweeter than i prefer my salsa and given the price i do n't think it is something i would eat with any frequency but definately worth the novelty and if sweet and spicy salsas are your thing , you just might end up loving it ! . 
nice combination of ingredients so that it is very hot , yet still has great flavor it has a little added sugar , which adds a nice bit of sweetness to the mix for the hotter salsas , you really ca n't go wrong with this this is one of my top four favorites , which include mrs renfros hot salsa , screaming sphincter and pain is good 37 . 
i am very acustom to spicy foods and this has a very rich flavor half the bottle was devoted to given people my not so hot salsa reactions amazing worth the money ! as for me eating it the title says it all . 
my cats \( 7 of them \) love this food so i was glad to see amazon is carrying it again the local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag , only the 3 5lbs and 12 lbs this food is sealed very well , and is fresh i have tried expensive brands and really cheapo brands of cat food , and so far 9 lives agrees very well with my cats this food does not rifle through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors \( like cheapo cat food \) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy my cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old , and believe me , this 9 lives brand and flavor are something they all like the price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free br br i also buy the iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love again , no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now br br if you do try this , or switch your cat \( s \) over , be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust in the end , i think you will be very pleased with the quality and price br br also , we used to take in foster cats , and fed them this 9 lives brand , and they all did very well . 
my cats favorite cat food he is very pickey and will not eat a lot of different cat foods but he loves this one . 
i used to buy this at target but it 's cheaper at amazon br br my cat goes crazy when i get out the bag so i know she loves it cheap to boot , also ! br br i do n't really stress out about which exact ingredients are in cat or dog food i figure it 's all pretty decent so why not save a little money . 
there are 4 kittens that started hanging outside the house and i started feeding them rather than buying the smaller bags , this is a great value for multiple cats the kittens love the food and always look forward to eating it shipped right to your door ca n't go wrong with that ! . 
i purchase 2 15 pound bags of 9 lives daily essentials a month for my daughter 's cats they love it she says they often gather around the carton and wait for her to open it they know what 's in there and ca n't wait for it to be opened if the cats love it , we love it is n't that how it goes \? . 
my cats love this food for the money it is a great product i get it every month the cats love the flavor . 
i have 6 feral cats that i trapped , neutered spayed and released they still hang around our property so of course we feed them they really like 9 lives and i believe it is good for them being old and my husband handicapped , it is so easy for us to have it delivered right to our door step instead of wrestling with the bags at the store and unloading when we get home i am very satisfied with the product and amazon the subscribe and save option is even better as i do n't have to remember to order it . 
my two cats love this cat food more than the kirkland signature brand it 's also very cheap and affordable cat food at walmart i would recommend this cat food over meow mix or friskies any day get 9lives dry cat food it 's one of the better brands out there . 
one of my kitties is a complete snob when it comes to food and she loves this great product to buy . 
i love these pop these are rather small pops about 1 2 the size of a tootsie pop they come in many flavors i think this bag is great in the long run 300 just think halloween . 
dum dum lolly pops are the best ! they come i lots of kinds and tast really good ! . 
this stuff is great if you 're looking for a non alcoholic vanilla extract yes this is really a vanilla extract not just a flavor like the essence stuff i read somewhere on the net that the only reason they ca n't call it an extract is because it was n't extracted by alcohol so legally they have to call it a flavor br the smell and color are gorgeous plus its fair trade certified , the texture is a little bit like honey , i think it 's the glycerin br br going to buy again for sure . 
not paying attention , i thought this product was simply vanilla extract when i purchased it , tried it in my coffee , and got a shock yummy ! i had to go examine the bottle , and realized my yummy mistake i wonder what glycerin is , what it 's made of \? is it a fat \? br at any rate , it is delicious ! . 
i prefer the taste of this over the alcohol based vanilla extracts , particularly in uncooked items and beverages it has a fairly thick syrupy consistency . 
raw , organic , fair trade , tastes great what 's not to love \? my hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit . 
excellent in cereal , or on top icecream sundae i use them in my ramen noodle hot sour soup as well very very good almost a lite peanut flavor not too much salt , very lightly seasoned a must try for anyone wanting a low calorie addition of protien into diet even the dog loves them thinks they are some special treat . 
bought this for my mom for her birthday , she was dying to open it so we could all try it it was nice and fresh and everything tasted great ! wish i had bought one for myself ! . 
these dates were absolutely delicious i was a little bit worried because the one product review that it had was only one star but as i looked at all the other date reviews , the trend seemed to be bad reviews in the fall timeframe i had these delivered mid january and must say they were quite exquisite many thanks for a great treat at a large dinner party . 
expensive , but worth it , and ive tried every iced tea out there lipton is pretty good too , but this is the best ! ! tetleys sux , and many other iced teas like bigelow are terrible , but this is great ! like the coffee shop . 
i have nine cats and they are crazy about these kibbles ! the last thing you want is 20lbs of cat food the cats hate , but i 'll be buying them more of this . 
i have used your product for years and find myself in a town where they are sold only in very small bottles i am used to buying your product by the half gallon and would like to make my purchases online i have tried using other products which pale in comparison to your original barbecue sauce . 
if you like soft licorice , these cats are n't for you br br a perfect anise y balance of salty and sweet , these little licorice kitties are perfect ! you pop one \( or several \) in your mouth and let them melt a bit before you embark on your flavorful chewy journey br hard exterior lasts forever if you suck on them everlasting licorice katjes ! ! br br very fresh super fast shopping too thank you guys ! . 
very firm small pieces with an intense licorice flavor i love black licorice and have been trying different gluten free options i will be ordering more of this one . 
these tomatoes taste like home canned when summer is over and heirloom tomatoes no longer are available at the farmers market , these serve as an excellent reminder of the past season and a promise of the next i originally bought these organic tomatoes for my stepfather , whose heart disease dictated a low sodium diet and they are incredibly low in sodium but i soon bought them for myself after i tried them just once when the local organic grocery store and then sprouts stopped carrying them , i turned to amazon for a case they are as much a staple in my pantry as olive oil . 
the ingredients are simple and pure and one of the few brands that does not add unnecessary additives generally i like to make my own sauce from scratch , but this is my second choice if i am short on time its taste good and not artificially sweet i love the bionaturae products including the tomato paste . 
these are the best canned tomatoes i have tasted they have a fresh flavor , similar to home canned this is my second time buying a set they are a little more acidic bright , and have a rounder flavor than other tomatoes comes with a basil leaf in each can note , the 28 oz tins are a better value than the 14 oz ones . 
these arent diced , its just mush , but i like the no bpa and would buy again for that reason but dont expect diced . 
well one of my friends asked for a really big bag of gummy bears , she was very pleased when she opened the box than her co worker really like these gummy bears to . 
i have been eating these since about 5 years old and are my favorite chips in the world ! just dont eat too many of them ! . 
i love these chips and could n't contain my happiness when i recieved my box ! ! love them , if you love spicy foods get these ! ! . 
i used these and a bunch of other colored lollipops for a friend 's birthday and she got a kick out of it she had been complaining about feeling old so we threw a kid themed party she had a great time i do n't think it 's possible to eat one of these spiral lollipops without feeling like a kid ! . 
i used these lollipops for a candy princess costume for my daughter they came in perfect condition and exactly like the picture shows they do come in a group of 16 such a great value ! i was extremely satisfied ! . 
i had purchased these to go along with a candyland costume for halloween they shipped quickly and were packaged securely with bubble wrap none of the lollipops were broken in transit br br it turns out the costume i ordered \( from another seller \) did n't fit at all and was made of very cheap material so i could n't even alter it to fit since i had to return the costume , i requested to return these as well i was immediately fully refunded without even being asked to ship the lollipops back , so the five stars are so the amazing service br br now i think we 'll hand out the lollipops with the rest of our halloween candy , which i think the kids in our neighborhood will love ! . 
i bought these lollipops for my daughter 's 3rd birthday they are super cute and the kids loved them definitely met my expectations . 
i got these for my sons 3rd birthday i got it because i am doing a candy station for his birthday i wanted to put colorful lollipops as part of the candy station so this is just perfect for my idea . 
being the candy lover that i am , i wanted to buy some cute lollipops that i could pull out of my bag and enjoy whenever i felt like it for that purpose alone , i 'd give them five stars however at first lick , the lollipop has a slightly off taste but this goes away after a minute and is not unbearable or disgusting in any way i laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are 'made in china' i'm not dead dying sick good enough \? as well , the text on the wrapper is fine i was n't repulsed by it and i'm not afraid to share i 'd only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating br the colors are not as vivid as in the picture , and the lolipops are not glazed so they do not have that shiny look that many others have none of mine came broken , and they were well wrapped i'm happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all \( minus the few that i share with friends \) , but i 'd try something different next time . 
i used this for my daughters candy land birthday party and the kids loved them ! they are n't full size , but they are still sooooo cute ! ! ! . 
bought these for a birthday and they were perfect all arrived uncracked and wrapped really well super cute and perfect for 4 year olds . 
i ordered the lollipops for party favors at my son 's 1st birthday party the lollipops are 2 inches and i used 1 5 inch thank you stickers on them so cute ! the description states that 16 lollipops are included in the order i ordered 2 boxes and only received 12 lollipops in each box i contacted the seller 's customer service i received a response and apology right away they promptly corrected the order i was pleasantly surprised to receive another full box of 12 and not just the 8 i expected the lollipops are wrapped in bubble wrap out of three boxes only one lollipop was cracked not a big deal to me since i did receive an extra box great lollipop at a great price . 
comical that this is considered a 'toy' i bought these as a decoration for a circus themed baby shower and they arrived in perfect condition i used them in vases surrounded by colored crinkle cut paper and used as centerpieces on the buffet table lots of compliments i have kept them and plan to use again for future parties these will not be consumed so no idea how they taste . 
got these as part of a party favor for a rainbow birthday party , so i have n't actually tasted them the lollipops are cute the wrappers have writing on them , which i wish they did n't \( would have been much cuter without the writing \) they are a bit smaller than i expected \( just slightly larger than a regular lollipop \) , and a few arrived broken , but really , they were well packaged , and looked cute for the party . 
these arrived securely packaged , not even a chip on one lollipop they also tasted really good and looked very pretty at my sister 's baby shower i would buy these again for myself and suggest to future buyers ! . 
anyone who has been on a low carb eating program for any period of time will tell you that it gets boring we are new to the dixie carb counters line , but i was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent taste some of the other low carb lines \( like atkins \) have a terrible aftertaste , or require the user to have a great imagination \( yes this is really supposed to be a chocolate bar \) but the dixie carb items are great easy to make , nice portion size , great taste , and no imagination required it really is a muffin ! and no sugar alcohol ! my only issue is that they are a little pricey otherwise perfect ! . 
i'm going to guess that 'yuck' did n't mix it up right , because , frankly , these taste surprisingly good considering they 're supposed to be lo carb they 're easy to make , and the non diabetic in the house thinks they 're just as tasty as i do i do agree that the price is pretty outrageous , though . 
i love salsa and have tried many on the market i served dippin fiesta at a recent sunday football get together and got rave reviews maybe the best salsa i have ever tasted and served if you want to taste the best , try this one . 
i spent the first five years of my life in brazil and my american parents both spoke portuguese fluently and introduced me to brazilian food and culture this is one of my favorite foods ever , and the lingering memory i have of brazil fluffy , moist and made out of tapioca flour , these little rolls are nothing like american cheese bread seriously they are n't ! its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven , and they 're just as fabulous cold br br yoki is the best maker of the dry mix , and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy , delicious treat or side dish they never turn out wrong . 
i made these recently for a holiday party i have never seen anything go so fast ! br br they were very easy to make just add a few ingredients , mix , and throw them in the oven i will definitely be buying and making these again . 
these are not as good at houston 's samba grill but they tasted great the texture is different but in lieu of having these on a daily basis , i have found something that i can make i would surely recommend these to anyonr . 
since being gluten free i 've tried all types of gf breads and they are all very expensive who knew that the brazilians had the bread game on lock with this inexpensive tapioca version of cheese bread ! it 's custom which is probably why they are all so skinny ! lol but i loved it and will be ordering a whole lot more ! . 
my item got to my house on time and i was surprised on how well my package was packed i recommend this store to anyone \) . 
despite what some think there is a ton of fillers in here \( see the ingredient list on the omaha site \) , but that is not a bad thing in this case they are not unhealthy fillers and these are very delicious our kids just love them we serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal 1 piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wondering br br calories 120 br br fat 4 5 br br trans fat 0 br br sodium 270 br br carbohydrate 17 br br protein 3 br br for our dinners we try to keep our carb side to under 5 fat 25 carb this fits perfectly the taste is superb baked in the oven , they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside all with no grease we now keep these on hand instead of french fries i know they cost more , but they taste better and they are so much healthier we wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time . 
perfect year round with just about any meat dish , these omaha steaks twice baked potatoes are a gourmet delight the consistency of the whipped potatoes is smooth and the little bits of bacon , peppers and cheese add to the explosion of flavor they cook easily in either the conventional oven , or on the grill when wrapped in foil ! go ahead , treat yourself ! . 
these are actually very tasty pure potatoes with a great texture and no nasty filler stuff no bacon , no cheese just tasty potatoes they cook well in either the oven or microwave i add a touch of either salt pepper or fajita seasoning to spice it up i rated 4 out of 5 stars because they could be a bit bigger portion however , this item is a fairly good value for the money . 
they are more potato crockets in the shape of a ball rather than au gratin , but nevertheless yum yum yum ! . 
i love to order these type of cooked potatoes and they are so great with a steak . 
i really like this product it tasted great and only took a few minutes to make in the microwave . 
very good side dish , easy to make , easy to eat as others have said , needs a little spice , but other than that they are delicious ! . 
excellent will order again ! ! it 's nice to be able to order omaha items from amazon because amazon ships sooo fast , and payments are so convenient . 
i was surprised at the size of these potatoes i have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small these are perfect ! ! tasty , cook just right love 'em ! ! . 
excellent and tasty though i thought not enough garlic so i added more when i order garlic i guess i expect more of it but perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers , a premier company , hard to find anymore . 
we had these along with omaha prime rib both were great two where plenty to fill up made them in toaster oven in less then 20 minutes . 
i received 4 of these in my first ever omaha steaks order that i received today i was n't sure what to expect , but so far , i 've been pleased i tore the plastic open , put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious the cheese filling was crispy on top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft no way would they come out as good if put in the microwave , so i 'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go now , you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what omaha charges for these alone , but as long as you get a good deal on the omaha website , these simply make a great addition to any omaha steaks order as delicious are they are though , i would n't order a box of just these off the site due to the added shipping costs but like i said , as long as they 're part of a nicely priced packaged deal , i 'll definitely take them actually , i probably would n't order any packaged deal in the future from omaha that did n't include these a big plus , at least for me , is if you check the ingredients list on these , there 's no partially hydrogenated oils , so there 's no traces of trans fats , which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes also no high fructose corn syrup , which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus if you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example , chances are , the butter used , sour cream , etc will be full of chemicals , trans fats high fructose corn syrup these , not so much so there is a definite degree of quality with omahas stuffed baked potatoes each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat , which is 42 the drv , but that 's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon , cheese and sour cream i was also expecting there to be no fiber , but it turns out there 's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half another plus overall , the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy , being made with quality ingredients . 
these potatoes are really very good my husband and i both love them and way too easy we will be buying more of these . 
i got these in the mail today , i know right , sounds so weird to say i got hash browns in the mail , haha come in dry ice cooler and were in box all in their own lil plastic bags just stick them on a baking sheet for 35 min at 400 degrees when you get them out of the oven you smell the cheese and it has nice crunchy outside with creamy potato inside , if you want the best side dish to your steak or other meat , hey could even use for breakfast with some eggs and sausage , your choice , this get a 5 5 for taste , 5 5 for presentation , buy these now , great price too , thanks for your time , and thank you omaha steaks , the best at great prices . 
january 3 , 2011 br br i purchased these potatoes from omaha steaks online last week i was not sure what to expect the au gratin potatoes i had seen and tasted before were sliced potatoes with globbs of gooey cheese sauce , and by the looks of them , this certainly was n't it i opened the box and got out my skillet the first thing that i noticed is that these things were huge like a gigantic tater tot i browned them on both sides about 10 minutes each to my surprise , they were very tasty texture was light fluffy and the potatoes tasted extra fresh not frozen or freezer burned i liked them alot i think these are perfect for kids none of the flavors were overpowering and great texture i give these 4 stars . 
so so good ! delicious , easy to prepare food ! i would definitely order again had a gourmet taste , and took only minutes to get ready yum ! ! ! . 
i like em but nothing unique about the flavor basically saves you from having to make them at home a little pricey but for a treat what the heck . 
they taste pretty good i eat one of these with some of the poultry selections from omaha steaks it makes a great meal . 
these potatoes are pretty good they can be eaten alone or served with a meal really like potatoes and this is an easy choice . 
i prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven they are the perfect compliment to a hamburger , steak or chicken entree try them you 'll like them ! . 
very good transaction and omaha food was sent properly i already left one feedback . 
these potatoes are very good along with all their steaks and hamburgers i would definately recommend omaha steaks to anyone looking for a gourmet dinner at a reasonable price ! . 
i'm a big fan of outburst energy bites , and the peanut ones are probably my favorite they 're reasonably priced and a great snack think of peanut m m 's and a coffee all at once since they taste so good , it is very tempting to eat the whole box they claim it 's a lot of caffeine , but it does n't feel like more than a big coffee or a large energy drink , so i usually give in to the temptation ! br br i highly recommend these ! . 
energy bites f'ing rip your face off with molten lava energy br br infinity energy to the f'ing max i ate a whole box once and threw a car at a baby br br f'ing rave br br seriously these are great . 
i originally found this roasted garlic juice at one of those roadside shops that sell a variety of foodstuffs , plants and ice cream that was about a year ago and unfortunately , the place is now out of business i was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on amazon , as i could n't find anything even close at any grocery store in a 50 mile radius store managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice i told them if they carried it , they would sell a lot br br i have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor ca n't be beat ! it is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine i prefer the roasted over the cold pressed , but both are great in their own way it 's nice to be able to pour or spray br br bottom line if you are a garlic lover , buy this ! ! ! ! ! . 
it 's a great product especially if you like garlic ! no need for slicing dicing ! \( which is a good thing when your right side is stroke paralized ! \) just garlic too not an oily salty product just plain or roasted garlic ! and it lasts a long time too ! . 
i love my garlic spray so much , that i ordered more ! i grow garlic , but i do n't even bother juicing them anymore , not with this product there are 150 cloves in every bottle thats a lot of yummy garlic . 
i love the taste of real garlic not the granulated or brined stuff these are great flavoring agents , especially for popcorn as a liquid in glazes and rubs love the choice between roasted and raw , and a little goes a long way i first bought this product 2 years ago despite using one or the other at least once a week , i am only now needing to replace them br yum ! . 
i had heard about their prickly pear tea in a forum and decided to try it since i had n't had any since i was in arizona it was better than i remembered ! i tried it first hot and then used the remainder for ice tea and both were really good the company delivered super fast too which was great i recommend this tea highly , particularly if you like prickly pear teas . 
butternut mountain maple syrup is the real deal the grade b is wonderful on pancakes , or in coffee just about on anything you 'd like sweetened br delivery was timely and the product came as expected i recommend this ! . 
i just received my shipment and could hardly wait to try this product we love quot slickers quot which is what we call them , instead of stickers because they can be removed so easily my daughter designed signs to be printed in reverse to use on her car windows they printed beautifully \( we have 'the print shop' program \) i am going to have a lot of fun with this product because there are windows everywhere and other surfaces like tv screens and computer monitors . 
this was a really good idea and the final product is outstanding i use the decals on my car window and everybody asks where i bought the decals i made two thumbs up ! . 
after years of drinking red bull , rockstar , monster and some others , i have found the holy grail of energy drinks it kicks in within 2 3 minutes and it lasts an entire work day after seven hours or so , you gradually come down there is no anxiety or disphoria when it wears off you just get very sleepy when you finally rest br br redline power rush is the very best product on the market if it were illegal i would buy it on the black market 'nuff said . 
the normal 15oz can is too much spam for one person the 7oz version is perfect for me to make two sandwiches i cut the block in half each half i cut into 4 slices the 4 slices are perfect to lay on top of a toast with some salad green and 2nd toast , it becomes a quick and filling lunch sandwich when i hike or backpack \( need sodium to replace electrolyte \) the 2nd half will become my 2nd sandwich if i do overnight backpacking \( for dinner \) . 
our family loves spam and amazon makes it so easy and such a great deal to buy in bulk the 7 ounce size is perfect for our use amazing what you can use spam for add it to all your favorite recipes in place of other meats ! super convenient to have it come in automatic shipments without having to give it a second thought ! . 
it 's a long time since iv'e eaten spam but i decided to give it a try i always had left overs before but with this size can i simply enjoy every bit in one serving . 
well worth the price very large chocolate truffles that taste amazing ca n't wait for amazon to get them again 1 january 2012 just browsed to the truffle page and had a mini heart attack when i saw the price they were 12 00 when i purchased them in 2011 . 
excellent product crab cakes made with lump style crabmeat has been a family tradition during christmas holidays for over 40 years local grocery stores do not carry lump style and only offer fancy minced crab meat which is ok but not as satisfatory as lump style . 
these treats are the only ones my 14 year old dog will eat she loves them . 
she will play with it before eating it since she is small it acts like a tiny ball for her they are expensive , but less so at amazon than at a pet store . 
i have three small dogs and these are one of their favorite treats ! i do n't have to worry about them choking and i feel i am giving them a healthy treat ! please do n't ever stop making them pet n shape . 
terrific with english triffle beware though the pack of 6 each of the 6 containers makes about a gallon of pudding . 
after you 've made the customary , authentic english trifle with bird 's custard powder you might not want to go back to the usual grocery store pudding packages i did purchase a large quantity of bird 's custard power , the pack of six , but the packs have a longish shelf life , and i enjoyed sending a surprise pack container to a friend who is originally from england br br at christmas , i will also include a container of bird 's custard powder to special relatives and friends so they can learn how easy it is to make excellent trifle with this product for my non english family and friends , i will include laminated instructions based on my own successes with bird 's custard recipe for trifle br br english trifle is so easy to make with the following bird 's custard powder , store bought pound cake , thawed frozen fruit , some sherry wine \( or slightly sweetened juice from the thawed frozen fruit \) poured over the small slices of cake for the final touch , add non dairy whipped creme delicious and inexpensive ! i highly recommend this product and am so pleased to be able to purchase it through amazon and the price for the six containers is so very reasonable as to almost be unreal go for it ! . 
we found this on our recent trip to england and had to find it as soon as we got home br it 's a standard for the brits , and for us now too it 's been around forever br you can use it in so many ways pies , trifle , donuts , br cakes , by itself with fresh fruit and whipped cream , or even on french toast ! . 
i am from england and i was raised on this custard if you like vanilla custard pudding you will love this it 's rich and creamy and has lots of vanilla taste i love that it comes in a big canister and i can make as much as i want to i would never make a trifle with anything else . 
this is a great product , we have made custard with it for years and it always makes great custard we will purchase this product again amazon does a great job of getting us our purchases fast and without damage . 
life without bird 's custard has been hell ! i 've tried other varieties sthg from holland if i recall correctly just not up to snuff i ordered 6 to ensure i never run out ! better than ice cream and not half as fattening . 
i purchased this product because i have previously used it and it is not always easy to locate on store shelves i prefer it to other powdered custard \( pudding \) products for ease of making and taste it 's wonderful in trifles or just about any pudding type dessert you want to make amazon gets the product to you almost immediately and at a reasonable price . 
hard to find locally great price , especially with the free shipping have enough to share with family and friends . 
this is a wonderful and very handy product i'm thrilled by all the yummy ways this can be used my aunt , who lived in ireland for 7 years , said they used it all the time and loved it . 
i actually use this mix to make vegetable biryani and it works well for this purpose , with some slight adjustments to the recipe br br i do have one caveat about the product , but it 's about the recipe given , not the spice mix i think the amount of ghee it is suggested you use \( 200 grams \) is too much , and you can easily use 100 grams instead also , i think it 's easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken \( or vegetables \) with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying br br to make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken , coconut milk for yogurt , and safflower or peanut oil for ghee br br overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani i 've had outside of a restaurant , and even rivals some of them and the price makes this an incredible deal there are 2 bags per package and there are 6 packages , so this makes 12 large batches for 13 with free shipping i will definitely order more when i run out . 
i love this tea it has a mild flavor and no caffeine the only problem is that the string comes detached from the bag after about a minute in hot water this does n't happen once in a while , it happens nearly every time br br triple leaf tea , please fix this bag issue it 's frustrating to the point where i may look for a similar tea from another company . 
anytime i have started to get even the slightest sore throat , i drink this and the next morning it 's gone i always bought it at world market , but they said it has been discontinued but , thank god for amazon ! . 
this tea is so helpful for congestion and it tastes great too make sure you let it steep as long as the directions say it really seems to help you to feel better . 
a friend sent me two boxes of this for christmas i thought it an odd gift , as i can just go out and buy herbal tea shortly thereafter , i was flung into major stress and chaos during an extreme family crisis i started drinking this tea to help with unexpected stomach pains and it worked ! not only that , during this time , other family members got physically ill , but i was able to carry on without catching the bug since then , i'm a believer i make this as iced tea for daytime and drink a cup at night before bed . 
in cold weather , i brew this tea by the pot , keep it simmering , and brew a lemon ginger or ginger lemon tea , by the cup , made with this as the base my husband will drink it , and i ca n't get him to use any other medicinal \( hates licorise \) it helped a great deal last winter . 
have bought this from the folks who prepare it and i must say , this is the absolute best item i have ever tasted they make this at a farm in benson , az and it tastes like heaven highly recommend it for everything i tend to slice up apples and dip them have tried it on toast as well . 
i 've been feeding liver biscotti for years i was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog \( additives can be a seizure trigger \) and liver biscotti filled the bill the ingredients are top quality the bite size bits are perfect for training and do n't muck up your pockets the bite size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds , which is a problem with other treats and for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities , there is an anti allergenic recipe enthusiastically recommended ! . 
this is an excellent training treat for every day it 's not a high value treat \( used for more challenging training situations \) nor is it so bland that it does not serve as an incentive it 's a good size , though it does make some crumbs plus , liver biscotti is fun to say ! . 
my 2 dogs love this treat when my oldest \( male \) was younger , he would sit down , stand up , go down , roll over , etc and do every trick in his repertoire before i even gave him a command whenever i pulled out a bag of the liver biscotti my female also loves this but she 's a little less silly also , this has never upset their stomachs nor caused allergic reactions i finally had to find a place that sold this in bulk \( i e , 5 lbs bags \) since i was going to the store all the time to buy more of these i also stuff their kongs with a combo of these and their regular kibble and some pumpkin and freeze it i highly recommend this treat . 
five of my five dogs agree they 'd rather munch liver biscotti than almost anything else i pull out a treat and they come running it cheers 'em up , encourages them to obey , lets 'em know i love 'em , and got me over some really rough training spots with my 90 pound puppy ! ! ! and in a few instances when i 've been slow producing the goodie , they 've cornered me and dug in my pocket themselves ! i think it 's a hit ! . 
our dog loves these treats we sprinkle a few into his regular dry dog food , and he gobbles everything up as fast as he can we also use them as rewards for good behavior wonderful , nutritious , really good to have on hand at all times . 
lucy loves these treats as does her friend , daisy i do not know what else to say to fill up the 210 word minimum . 
my dog will do anything for these treats buying a five pound bag lasts about a year and they are dry so they are easy to put in your pocket and they last forever . 
despite what many say and think about bulldogs , ours are picky about their snacks they love the liver biscotti which can be a hand fed treat or used in a treat ball they last longer than most snacks and because our bullies do n't often chew their food , these are the perfect size i do n't feel bad about feeding these either because they are low calorie and without fillers . 
our dog named big red loves your liver biscoti and the closest store was 54 miles round trip i am not too keen on driving that far so i found your mail service on the internet now our 8 pound poodle gets his treats again ! . 
they 're perfect training treats for my dogs they go to the place where they 're stored and stand there until i get a handful for our play games . 
even my vet approves these little treats are my dogs favorite i just get the small ones because i have a small dog . 
my dogs go crazy over liver biscottis they are nice and crunchy which helps clean their teeth and all the ingredients are wholesome . 
my dog would have to stop breathing before she would fail to perform for liver biscotti even my friends with finicky dogs are surprised how their dogs love the stuff . 
if there is one thing our dog likes , it is the liver biscotti dog treats these make the best rewards and training treats we have used . 
as another reviewer mentioned , these treats are crunchy ! i like them for 2 reasons my dog ca n't just woof them down , she has to chew them , so they last and i like that the cruchiness may be good for her teeth the treats are small , but again , are crunchy i'm glad i found these she loves them and i like giving them to her . 
i have two dogs that absolutely love these treats ! the 5lb bag size that i purchased is very convenient and long lasting the vendor that i purchased them from is very thorough several emails were sent updating me on the status of my order and it 's upcoming delivery the price was extremely reasonable the best part is the fact that my pups adore these treats and they are good for them to nibble on throughout the day a guilt free doggie reward ! . 
our portuguese water dog has been trained on these bite sized little treats he loves them and will do anything for them good dog ! . 
i don't mind paying a lot for a quality treat for my dogs as these are , but i have a real problem in companies who price gouge on shipping charges its obviously not enough for them to get the amount of money \( which is high \) for the treats themselves they have to also make money off me for shipping charges there is no way that it cost them 10 to ship a 5lb bag of treats to me 6 dollars would be fair and accurate , this is the reason i gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 . 
our four dogs love this stuff ! this bite size treat is a perfect size for training the dogs like the crunch it 's shaped like a small square crouton there is enough in this huge bag to make little gift bags for friends with dogs . 
the ultimate treat for dogs of all sizes our dogs are absolutely crazy for liver biscotti we love the size of this treat , it makes it very easy to use them as daily treats and not worry that you are over feeding the size is also great for using as bait for conformation showing br br we love the fact that all natural ingredients with no preservatives are used all you have to do is open the bag and smell what 's inside it smells so good , you might be tempted to try one too br br we love the 5 pound bag having multiple dogs , this bag really is a cost saver you 'll see significant savings over buying the small 8oz bags br br it also makes a great gift for your dog loving owning friends , spread the joy of liver biscotti ! . 
a fantastic product for pet treats , great smell and has freeze dried liver treats beat by leaps and bounds owner of 2 fussy cockers . 
omg these things are delicious ! i'm not a candy sweets eater usually but ohman ! i liked them so much i may have had , two oops , now three ! . 
i was just messing around on amazon when i ran into this add for beer nuts , when i noticed someone had left a review it was pretty funny , being the beer lover that i am , i had to try them , well they 're here now and i cant drink beer without them , they have a story on the back about how the guy got started in the 50 's , and soon his beer nuts were in bars around america ! iican see why , they 're pretty darn good . 
i used to eat beer nuts all the time as a kid sorta like honey roasted peanuts , but more unique flavor if you never tried'em , if you like honey roasted peanuts , you 'll love these ! . 
great product ! wish they were still available in bars , pubs , and stores have given cans to several of my golf buddies and they agree with me i'm just glad they are still available on line . 
some reviewers must have a short memory i 've been eating beer nuts since childhood and the ones i ordered tasted like they always have \( sweet and salty \) bought them locally until i could n't find them anymore great product and price for 6 12oz cans . 
after a second purchase of a 12 oz beer nuts peanuts 6 pack , i can level no complaints the shipment again arrived without any adverse settling such as clumping inside the cans although the flavor may be a bit duller than my abiding childhood memory of them , this may be attributable instead to the diminished taste buds of a middle ager nonetheless , everyone i know who has tried this product likes it either as a stand alone snack or as an adjunct to a couple of beers , beer nuts is a tasty , if understated winner . 
this is the second time ordering beer nuts i can not find them anywhere in local stores the shipment came \( 6 cans per order \) and 2 cans were damaged called amazon customer service and the next day another 6 cans appeared at my door br br the nuts are always great \( unless can is damaged and nuts are stale \) but the customer service was the shining star thank you ! ! will order again . 
my husband is a beer nut lover looked in many stores br and could only find small bags love these large cans . 
i am 76 years old and i have eaten these nuts for many years the ones mailed to me are very tastey the only problem is that they were jostled around and a lot of the red skins came off and went to the bottom of the can no big deal but it would have been better if they had stayed on the nuts i will order from amazon again . 
not always available at our local stores i love them they are especially good watching football games , with you favorite malt beverage this is a good deal , and super fast delivery , too the nuts were fresh and tasty , as always . 
these are the long time classic not as sweet as honey roasted peanuts , these have just the right balance to go with a nice cold brew amazon 's price on these is really great . 
this is the good stuff ! i am eating some right now with some sweet basil tomato sauce this pasta has a neat shape and it cooks up nicely it 's colorful and tasty and is great al dente . 
all of the castellana pastas are absolutely wonderful they have a great taste , hold their unique shapes , grab lots of sauce in your dishes , and have a nice bite this is a great price for this item ! . 
br br oh , i love this pasta ! it is thick , chewy , absolutely extraordinary ! and made with authentic flavorings to boot ! the red are flavored with tomato and red beet powder the green are flavored with spinach powder and basil powder the black pastas are flavored with squid ink , the off white are au naturale the yellow pasta are flavored with turmeric , the orange with carrot powder a rainbow of beauty and natural delectable flavor br br the pasta are shaped like little cresent moons with a rough exterior to absorb whatever sauce or oil you might use because this pasta is so very flavorful , i enjoy it best with a good quality olive oil and some celtic sea salt sometimes i add some tarragon or fresh rosemary , usually not , so i can just savor the pasta alone it also is excellent with olive oil and fresh grated parmesan chees on top br br with only 1g of fat , 10g of sodium , this can also be a heart healthy meal there are 7g of protein and 42g of carbos , no added sugars or preservatives br br it is the perfect easy dish to impress company or a date ! br br to be able to buy the best packaged pasta in the whole wide world at half price in bulk from amazon is a wonderful privilege you will not be disappointed br br . 
yes , it 's expensive , but it 's worth it ! i have yet to find a marinade that stands up to this one add some crushed garlic , sauteed onions and vegetables of your choice , then mix it all with this sauce and whatever meat you choose \( i prefer using the resulting marinade by adding some fresh rosemary and lamb \) for two days you wo n't believe the oohs and aahhhs you get at the table worth every penny ! . 
it 's not a traditional bbq sauce in terms of flavor , but you could easily use it for that it 's very thick and has a strong hotness \( not too hot but hotter than most spicy bbq sauce \) and it 's made from much better ingredients than most bbq or sweet hot sauces it tastes very fruity rather than sugary sweet it would be great on almost anything grilled or stir fried , and it 's incredible in pork and beans do n't let the price scare you away from this outstanding condiment . 
it 's always wonderful to be able to give chocolates as a gift and to receive them it 's great to know that you can send someone some chocolates with the guarantee that they do n't arrive all melted good service and excellent chocolates ! . 
we love strawberries dipped in chocolate but locally we could not find the dark chocolate type so glad we found this at amazon it is wonderful ! . 
best dipping chocolate ever ! i dipped strawberries , pretzels marshmallows its wonderful my whole family loves them great to bring out to friends or occasions ! dont forget the wax paper , otherwise it will stick to your plate ! . 
i have tried a couple of different cocao powders but this one is a step above the other ones the richness of the bean has a dark smooth flavor within the powder it is just a better product . 
i use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks with the high price of cocoa on the commodity market , this is an excellent price , especially for an organic product the cocoa is less tasty than my regular brand , but does very well for the price my main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with no label i would like to see an organic label , as well as , the nutrition info for the product . 
this cocoa powder has a deep , fruity taste i highly recommend it i recently bought a vitamix blender , which means that i now make 5 smoothies a day this cocoa powder , plus some almond milk , frozen fruit , yogurt , and a dash of maple syrup , makes an excellent milk shake disclaimer i like 99 9 of all chocolate , so take this positive review with a grain of salt . 
almost identical to ghiradeli 's great chocolate taste but raw ! organic ! the best ! ! ! i also whip it into whipped up sprouted almonds with strvia and make ball snacks from it , yummmm . 
this was my first time ordering raw cacao powder and i was pleasantly surprised ! the item was packed and shipped professionally and i love the resealable bag i initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and i did n't taste anything i then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas i was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake ! this is one of the best deals you 'll find \( online \) on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great this is one of the healthiest foods in the world and i recommend this seller if you 're looking to purchase it . 
raw cacao powder differs greatly in taste than processed cacao powder commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor commercial cacao powder is mono tonal in flavor raw cacao is everything that commercial cacao is n't it is a antioxidant super food which has no equal the taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next as to taste , it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of mahogany in foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao in baking , i believe it goes well with other flavors such as almond extract if you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of almond extract , your icing will have no equal in chocolate cake i personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake the acid helps to unify and amplify flavors i like making cake with 60 cake flour which is about has about 5 wheat gluten and 40 rice flour the reason for this should be obvious the heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough br br raw cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols , such as catechins and procyanidins , and has been shown to inhibit low density lipoprotein \( ldl \) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high density lipoprotein \( hdl \) and decreases ldl levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens . 
this powder , and this company , are both superb there was a small problem with the order and they handled it in such a gracious manner that i will be a customer forever . 
this is a very tasty cacao powder it arrived in an unmarked bag \( does not have an organic symbol or product description \) but it seems to be the real deal good flavor , similar to or better than name brand powders i have purchased in the past will definitely purchase again . 
bought as gift for hard to buy for father he loved bread said it was delicious ! ! . 
wonderful product br br all the bread mixes i have tried on amazon are not disappointing ! ! ! br br will be back for more they will make great christmas presents . 
i figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be this is it if you are of a 'certain age' \( over 40 or 50 \? \) you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon this cannot be found in store bacon anymore modern bacon is thin , lightly poorly smoked even the so called 'gourmet' bacon this is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the good old days arrives nice and cool in an ice pack cheaper if you buy the 12 pack . 
love this , dont use too much because it is strong , but it tastes great makes even mediocre salmon taste great . 
these are thin , crisp , fragrant cookies and are very delicious and tasty they are excellent with a glass of cold almond milk or hot herbal tea \( my choices \) if you like ginger snaps you will love lars ginger snaps . 
these ginger cookies are it i do n't have to look anymore i have found the cookie i ate the entire box and did not share so hubby said when i order more i have to get 2 boxes cause he would like to have some \) . 
very good very tasty and authentic flavor ! i ordered these last minute for christmas , not knowing if they were going to arrive on time they arrived at my house on christmas eve . 
did n't have time to make these this year so i thought i would buy them i never buy cookies , but these i would buy again my son loved them the only thing i had to do was dip them in white chocolate br thanks . 
after finding out two of our family members have celiac disease , we had to give up licorice and cherry nibs candy tree 's organic cherry bites have no sugar and truly rival the cherry nibs with gluten after a year of not having the real thing my husband believes candy tree 's are actually better . 
this licorice has very good taste my daughter is on a gluten free diet and she loves these cherry bites . 
wow this was the first licorice i 'd had in two years after being diagnosed with celiac disease that was one of the hardest things to give up ! these are nice not exactly like the real thing , but close enough there are many companies that call their product licorice , but they are merely rip offs of dots candy i e nothing like real licorice very gooey and stick to your teeth these are quite firm , more like older licorice , but still a great chew it satisfied me and my craving for real licorice . 
gluten free foods tend to be extremely expensive when compared to regular foods this licorice follows that trend for the times when you 'd like to treat yourself , candy tree organic licorice is a tasty and safe treat for gluten intolerant people amazon seems to have the best prices on it too . 
this dressing became an instant favorite of mine it 's fat free without losing the flavor alot of other dresings lose alot of flavor in their fat free versions , and that only makes you have to use twice as much wish bone is now my only choice for ranch dressing my husband does n't usually go for fat free or diet anything , but i put this on our salads and he didnt even know ! . 
if i had not purchased this salad dressing myself , i never would have guessed it was fat free served it with fresh vegetables during thanksgiving pre dinner , and it was a definite hit with the guests too . 
like the flavor and it 's thick , unlike some fat free dressings that are really runny . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b000odry9i wish bone fat free ranch salad dressing , 16 ounce bottle \( pack of 6 \) a br br this is a great salad dressing tastes just as good and is as flavorful as the regular 'fatfull' dressing . 
the price is pretty good given that local stores sell one bottle for almost 4 do n't know why the price on this has gone up though . 
my doc has strictly limited me on what i can and cannot eat i can use this salad dressing and was pleased to find it in bulk at a great price good taste . 
want to taste something different \? then you are coming to the right place i just love the smoothness and flavor of the ranch dressingnow get on your horses \( or mules \) and order some today . 
this is a very smooth tea from argo tea i was so excited when they came to nyc , and i bought a bag of this tea to make at home it has an almondy chocolatey flavor \( but not overpowering \) it 's a great tea for everyone , including people just starting to drink tea i love it in a latte \( i just microwave some milk and use that instead of water \) . 
if you like jasmine tea , this is a great tea ! its lite not , overly medicine tasting like jasmine tea can be its also fun to watch the tea leaves unfurl i steep it so many times that until i lost count haha just great . 
we received a box of these at work and the whole package was gone moments after opening it up ! great biscuits and now i am ordering a couple boxes for a few gifts for people i ca n't figure out what to get . 
of all the flavors of tic tacs , these are my favorite great wild cherry flavor love them ! ! too bad they are n't more readily available to purchase locally . 
these little buggers are tough to find so i was happy to get a big pack at a good price online my daughter is content with these as a reward for doing something well and at 2 calories a piece , not all that unhealthy . 
definitely would reorder these again i think it would be better if they were offered in a bigger pack my kids love these great little valentine 's day gifts great stocking stuffers . 
i bought them for a friend because she loves the cherry ones and they 're hard to find i kept half for myself i admit , gone in no time . 
everyone knows what a tic tac is , but let me tell you something if you like orange tic tac 's , you 're going to love wild cherry tic tacs ! very cherry flavored with just enough of a mix of sweet and sour do yourself a favor and try some . 
i love these wild cherry tic tacs and they are impossible to find in stores i am so glad that i can get them from amazon and the price is excellent ! they are a great low calorie treat and i will keep buying them from amazon highly recommend this purchase ! . 
i low orange tictacs and after reading reviews i decided to try these and there almost just as good orange is still my favorite but cherry is pretty close . 
these are one of my favorite flavors of tic tacs the flavor is a true sour cherry and quite intense you really get a lot of flavor out of one 2 calorie treat , which can satisfy for quite a while ! . 
great thanks for the great service i do n't know what else to say i have said all i have tu say . 
since husband quit smoking many many yrs ago , he took up the tic tac habit with cinnamon tic tacs they no longer make cinnamon so he has tried the wild cherry and they are ok . 
very nice product br full of quality items not the cheap candies like other baskets . 
were just what my wife wanted and she loves them next she will get the other type of bar by the same vendor . 
i love sorghum flour it 's mild in flavor and smell , it 's easily mixed into flour blends for gluten free baking too it 's one of my favorites along with millet , sweet rice , coconut and almond . 
i buy most of my flours from bob 's red mill in the 4 pack boxes , if only because having all the bags and boxes the same size makes it easier to store them it 's good flour , and the bag 's a good size for baking for a small family also a good shape that will stand up on the counter while you scoop flour out of it . 
my sister is alergic to wheat so i make her a lot of gluten free foods i searched local stores and could not find sorghum flour so i looked on amazon and finally found it it was all packed wonderfully and arrived perfectly fine and i'm already using it . 
i love baking with the bob 's red mill 'sweet' white sorghum flour i use it in many things but i tend to lean toward sweeter treats such as cakes and muffins i make a crumble topping with this flour that my family and guests beg for ! i would highly recommend this flour to any baker , even more for the gluten intolerant ones i use normal recipes and just replace the wheat flour it always turns out fantastic ! . 
i am a big fan of sorghum flour for my baked goods it gives everything a bit of sponge \( especially cakes \) and adds an extra bit of sweet to the baking i highly recommend this for baking flour mixes you may not want to add it to savory recipes though because of the light sweet flavor . 
spectrum naturals walnut oil , refined , is a very mild oil i ca n't detect any walnut smell or taste any walnut flavor at all maybe that 's what you want in some cases , though i was hoping for a more nutty flavor like raw walnuts br br it does have the advantage of having higher omega 3 content than most oils also most oils that are high in omega 3 \( like fish oil and flax oil \) have a strong taste which you probably do n't want on your salad br br unlike some of spectrum 's oils , it is not organic . 
great product ! br br the stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all natural br br use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugar br br tastes more natural than artifical sweeteners and is healthy to use since it is an organic natural sweetener . 
i have recently been on a low carb diet , as i find that i can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave , honey , and dates these raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin , a hormone whose message is store fat ! insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore i would bloat from a high carb diet br br my dilemma is that i love sweets and now it is not a problem , thanks to products like stevia , a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years it has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar \( although for some people there might be a bit , as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar \) stevia used to be legal in the usa only as a cosmetic product because of politics companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition yet , aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis so i would use stevia at times , but the aftertaste was bad and to be honest , i was n't too crazy about the during taste either br br then i tried nunaturals this product is awesome and like no other stevia i have tried it is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste \( unless you put in way too much a common mistake by people new to this \) it comes in tablets and in powdered form \( in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings \) it also comes in alcohol free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor unlike aspartame \( which becomes even more toxic when heated \) stevia can be used in baking nunaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that \( since i am a raw fooder , i ca n't tell you how it tastes , but i am sure it is good , judging by their other products \) br br thanks to these great products , i can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets ! . 
i used to use agave nectar and honey even though i picked organic , there was still more sugar than desired after i put in my recipes i actually got tinea versicolor due to the sugars in those products br br but this product is great i use it in my protein shakes , smoothies , and baking recipes \( muffins , breads \) , and it 's awesome br br i make a chocolate milkshake and this stuff really rounds off the edges br cottage cheese br chocolate protein powder br cacao powder br almond milk br nustevia powder br br just need maybe 1 4 cup of each ingredient and 1 cup of almond milk and it takes just like a sugary chocolate milk shake . 
this is the best tasting stevia powder i 've tried most other powders have a weird after taste but this one does n't i recently bought a 5lb bag of it online and i'm making my way through it . 
cutting sugar out of our diet , we went to splenda then finding that it was also unhealthy and baking with it made foods flat and dry we went to stevia no calorie powder , after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects the trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste i also found that using a stevia that has an 80 ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that i have found because of using very small amounts this jar lasts for months this is also the best price anywhere ! swanson is a trusted vendor as is amazon . 
i am hooked on stevia not only is it all natural but it tastes great and is truly a guilt free sweetner br br of all the brands i have tried nunaturals is the best it dissolves easily in ice tea and it does not have any bitter taste br br i keep the packets in my car and my backpack for when i eat out , i use the stevia baking blend to replace sugar in all my muffins and cookies , and this is large 12 oz jar the best size for use at home i keep a 1 4 tsp measuring spoon in the jar to spoon it out br br i have given up all artificial sweetners i no longer drink diet coke \( and wont until they make it with stevia instead of splenda \) br br if you have not used stevia before i urge you to try it if you have used other brands and did not like them try nustevia and you will be impressed . 
this has been the best tasting stevia i have tried i also think this is a better value than some of the others i really like not having to open all the packets when i make a gallon of tea . 
if you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea , stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea you can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the stevia powder br br unlike artificial sweeteners , stevia is never bitter and wo n't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth the packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods br br by using a low calorie \( 0 calories \) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs , you will be ahead of the game every single time you use one packet of stevia , you are using less sugar and you wo n't even miss it br br the rebecca review . 
i hated stevia and it 's licorice taste until i tried nustevia since that day , i have almost completely eliminated sugar in my drinks i like that it is a plant based product and not bio engineered no after taste and you need very little to make anything taste sweet . 
i do n't like using artificial sweeteners because of the chemicals and because they do n't taste good i am a caregiver for my diabetic dad , and once i discovered this product i was hooked , except that it is hard to find where i live when i found it at amazon i put it on auto ship so i do n't run out the price has gone up a lot since i first found it on amazon , however , it still costs more in stores if and when i can find it there i make limeade with this which i keep on hand at all times in a gallon container of water i add 1 cup of lime juice and 2tbsp of stevia powder it is refreshing and almost no calories and no chemical aftertaste my dad uses the stevia in his coffee and his oatmeal i have n't tried cooking with it although i know they make one designed for baking , which i 'll possibly try this winter . 
i bought the nunaturals white stevia with maltodextrin several months ago as i'm trying to cut back on sugar and artificial sweeteners the first morning i tried it in my coffee and hated it it tastes just as bitter as equal or sweet n low i decided to give it another try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious i 've also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea so , i think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia all in all i'm glad i bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go i have tried many different brands of stevia but , so far this is the only one i have not thrown out i also tried truvia not a fan it makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice ! . 
if you are trying to get off sugar , this is the product for you i has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin , and no bitter aftertaste great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy i love this product . 
i have tried various brands of stevia , but i always come back to nunaturals i buy the 12 ounce container because i use it to sweeten everything if you have a sweet tooth as i do but do n't need the added pounds , then this is the ticket for you i drink a lot of tea , and this is my sweetener a lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste , but this is the best that i have found to resolve that problem highly recommended . 
if you need to cut down on sugar this is the way to go ! i love stevia in my iced tea and it 's great on your cereal also great stuff ! ! . 
i started using nustevia several years ago back then i had to purchase it from a health food store thanks to amazon i can now order and have it within a few days i never run out ! as for the product , it 's the best i 've tried several stevia products but they have an after taste not with nustevia please try if you have n't . 
i was looking for a healthier alternative to splenda and equal , nustevia taste great and this container lasts a long time . 
stevia is pretty much the only natural zero calorie sweetener there is , but most of the time the powdered stevia is so bitter ! not nustevia ! nustevia has absolutely no bitterness , and tastes exactly like real sugar ! it 's amazing ! add it to plain yogurt , you have an amazing guilt free dessert , breakfast , side dish , snack add it to tea , coffee , recipes , anything ! it is a truly magical product , and it is cheaper in the 12 oz container on amazon than anywhere else ! they also sell it at gnc , but it is 10 for 4 oz also , for drinks , i highly recommend the extremely potent liquid stevia , as sometimes the powdered version takes a while to dissolve in iced beverages \( it eventually does dissolve , though \) . 
after years of using synthetic sweeteners like equal and sweet n low , i realized their long term effects and wanted to find a good alternative nustevia was a lucky discovery it has virtually no bitter aftertase , it 's all natural and i 've been using it exclusively for more than a year now it works in both hot and cold beverages and comes in bulk and in packets for portability i have n't used it for baking and probably wo n't because the chemistry of most recipes depends on sugar or something similar to get a good effect however , for daily use in beverages , this product is very good . 
i was quite skeptical about stevia at first , but tried it with another brand and thought there was n't much difference in taste and i felt better about using a more natural product than the other artificial sweeteners out there i then started looking at getting a bulk container and happened upon this product i now have purchased this same product 4 times and am quite pleased the product is a bit more concentrated and we are using less of the product in our drinks and cooking than other competitors br br the deliveries are always quick and we have not had any issues at all with the product or packaging . 
we love this and use it as a sugar substitute in just about everything \( beverages , desserts , cooking \) it is not at all bitter , even in hot drinks like coffee for baking , there are good substitution charts online that tell you how much stevia to use per cup of sugar \( \) if you need to replace the bulk of sugar in a recipe , you also have to add homemade apple fiber to make it work \( \) my kids do n't notice the switch and i feel good about using it because it 's all natural . 
i am so happy i discovered this product i had tried several other brands in extract and powder form and nunaturals is by far the best virtually no aftertaste , quick dissolving and convenient it is also very economical at 1 5 cents a serving i use a 1 4 teaspoon measuring spoon and it sweetens my coffee or tea perfectly do yourself a flavor and get this stevia powder you 'll be happy you did ! . 
i discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee , tea and on fruit and oatmeal it was a lot less expensive in the packets then , but i 've switched to the large 12 oz container and the price is very good i do n't use sugar and this helps me have the sweet and not the increased blood sugar yeah ! ! . 
i love this stevia ! i have tried many different kinds over the years and this one is my fave ! goes great in my coffee and tea i have this one on auto ship and get one a month \( makes it pretty cheap too ! \) . 
i have tried every brand of stevia on the market and this is , hands down , the very best out there i use nu naturals nustevia for all sweetening purposes it can be hard to find even in health food stores and the ones that carry it usually charge a premium i was delighted to find it on amazon com for a very reasonable price , even less when obtained through a standing order . 
this stevia is the best tasting we 've ever tried it also mixes into beverages more thoroughly than some others the service from this buyer was prompt , the product arrived on time and in excellent condition would order from them again , and recommend them to others linda blyth . 
i ordered this after having much success with their liquid products it is not bitter at all and has a very fresh clean taste to it i have baked with it , used it on the stove , and in my oatmeal and hot cocoa when i run out , i 'll be ordering more ! . 
nunaturals stevia is the only sweetener that i use in my beverages and cooking i have tried other brands and this one is the best ! it has n't any odd taste , and tastes better than sugar to me i buy the large 12 ounce container and it lasts me for months ! i only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores there is a soda that has stevia in it that i purchase at a health food store called virgil 's zero and it comes in different flavors it is great and i do n't have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas this product is great and i think is the best of stevia products on the market . 
i find that this jar product works better for people without as much dexterity in their hands vs using opening sweetener packets this product works well both in cold hot things like homemade lemonade in coffee easy to open lid product dissolves more easily in cold liquids , than many other types of stevia . 
i used to buy this product in this size at a health food store in florida for 27 dollars where i moved to in ny i could not find it in the stores so i looked online with shipping costs , it still cost under 20 dollars br br i use this product in tea and coffee and i like it better than real sugar i do n't find it bitter at all even when i accidently put a little too much in ice tea sometimes i forget it 's not real sugar when it 's in ice tea i especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste i have used it in baking simple pound cakes and cookies and they were good . 
nustevia 's white stevia powder is amazing ! i have been on a low carb diet for the last year and have lost 27 lbs , and nustevia products were a big help with the success of my diet i love sweet things , and without them i do n't think i 'd have been able to stay on the low carb diet i have been unable to eat sugar for a long , long while i had previously switched to natural sweeteners like honey and agave , but when i discovered they were not on the low carb diet i 'd switched to , i had to find something else to use as a substitute nustevia products are what i chose i tried several other types of stevia , but nustevia products seem to be the best so far the bitter aftertaste associated with most stevia products is almost completely absent from nustevia products br nustevia white stevia powder is super sweet , so you 'll have to use it sparingly , and one bottle lasts a very long time br i'm very happy with the product and will be buying it again and again . 
the first time i tried this product was 2 years ago at the venetian spa restaurant in las vegas having a cup of tea with some friends we all remarked how delicious and tasty it made our tea we 've been using it ever since a little goes a long way and i use it anytime i would ordinarily use a sweetener since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and i have a sweet tooth , i felt this was a safe alternative not only is it safer , but there 's no aftertaste and does n't raise your blood sugar level this particular stevia has absolutely no bitter taste to it i 've tried others before and since and there 's no comparison . 
very happy with the product in a taste test , for the price , it ranks very high delivery was prompt and as expected . 
love this on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and scallions or even dill , great way to enjoy caviar and not break the bank . 
roland red lumpfish caviar is excellent the price is good and affordable , it makes a good presentation for company , and tastes very good i purchased many items from amazon , even large ticket items , and i am very satisfied with the products and service . 
because they brought bagels to america without which we never could get maximum level of enjoyment out of this delightful low cost caviar caviar for breakfast ! we use the small soft plain bagels cut in two upon which we smooth a bit of cream cheese then a nice ring of caviar in the center of which is colorful and delicious cut up hard cooked egg then add a perfect cup of coffee this is is best done on a week end so it can be savored ever so slowly no stress involved pure luxury yes , yes , yes , yes , yes . 
not knowing what to expect i decided to take a chance since it was n't that expensive i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the caviar i put this stuff on just about anything i could and it was amazing i do n't know too much about caviar , but for this price i do n't think anybody can complain . 
this is a joy to serve on my mini potato pancakes with sour cream and then a teaspoon of this caviar on top soooooo tasty and pretty for christmas thanks for offering it . 
all of the roland products are top quality roland 's caviar is the real deal , unlike some other brands that are really made from seaweed ! . 
if u have not tried this u r missing the best thing u could cook for your family i give this 10 stars . 
cooked in healthy coconut oil that 's why it stays crunchy ! will not give you side effects of vegetable oil oxidized cholesterol , transfats , rancidity , and free radicals when you eat foods fried in canola soybean or corn oil . 
these are a cheap alternative for summer when everyone wants a cold treat superior flavor and size than the fla vor ice case . 
we first tasted this coffee in the hotel coffee shop in costa rica while on vacation we bought a few bags and brought them back home with us costa rica grows arabica coffee beans , fantastic we enjoy good coffee and it is best in the morning it 's strong , flavorful , full bodied , and not bitter in our 12 cup drip coffee maker , we use two rounded scoops \( about 5 tbs \) when we finished the last of the coffee , we looked on amazon and found the exact brand we had purchased in costa rica we bought four bags and will be getting more . 
forget starbucks , peets or anything else this is the real deal like a good vintage wine , britt coffee is truly gourmet with no after taste ! i am really fussy about coffee , and generally avoid it , but after a trip to costa rica fell in love with the beverage again ! you have to use a french press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making contraptions , your beans deserve the best , your taste buds deserve the best too no i do n't work for britt and did not get paid to say this ! ! ! ! ! but if you guys at britt read this send me a sample or two ! ! . 
this coffee is the smoothest dark roast coffee i have ever tasted , and it was a pleasure to sip this full bodied coffee before breakfast and after dinner . 
i love this coffee ! like the other reviewers , i took a trip to costa rica and was immediately addicted to this bold , flavorful coffee i am a cover lover and have tried many different brands only to find that britt is hands down the best i 've ever had i brought back one bag from costa rica and have started ordering my supply because i ca n't go back to other bland store bought coffees definitely worth a try ! you wo n't be disappointed . 
this coffee is delicious it is full bodied and leaves a great almost chocolaty after taste my dad told me about it after a trip to costa rica . 
my husband and i took a vacation to costa rica and had a wonderful time the whole time we were there we drank there britt dark roast and loved the taste there was no bitter after taste , plus i normally drink decaf and noticed with the britt regular dark roast it did n't bother me at all ! ! ! i do n't have to order decaf anymore and can enjoy the regular i now order it on line and find it to be the best tasting coffee i 've ever had br thanks for growing the best coffee beans in the world ! ! ! . 
great tasting coffiee ! ! one of the best i 've ever had ! the problem here is the high shipping costs . 
my husband and i fell in love with cafe britt coffee while we were in costa rica upon our return we were delighted to see that we could order it through amazon com ! the coffee is easy to drink not bitter or harsh and is a great way to start your day highly recommended . 
i used to use this coffee after we visited costa rica and gave some to my aunt she thinks it is the best coffee there is , so i gave her some for christmas it is excellent . 
i first tried britt dark roast when i was in costa rica it has a lot of rich flavor , but it is not bitter at all i 've bought br it by the case ever since it 's really no more expensive than those gourmet brands you find at your local store this is br simply the best coffee i 've ever had , and i 've tried many supposedly special ones over the years . 
i used super gold luster dust to create the most exquisite chocolate aspen leaves for the groom 's cake at my son 's wedding by using an artist 's paintbrush to lightly coat the molded leaves with luster dust , the result was startlingly beautiful in contrast to food coloring , the luster dust brushes on easily and imparts a realistically metallic color and sheen the containers are small but the product goes a long way , making it extremely economical to use a href http www amazon com gp product 1933981350 the step dynamic a powerful strategy for successfully growing your business a . 
i have used this product multiple times in fact , i purchased four tubs of the gold and silver luster dust \( 2 each \) five years ago and i am just now running out ! i use this stuff to gild all sorts of things for renaissance themed banquets including gilding an entire roast duck and then , using vodka , painting filigree designs onto it ! the clients thought it was prop food it looked so beautiful i ca n't recommend this stuff enough ! . 
i purchased this item for a cake that called for gold dust , never thought i would find it , but im glad i did when i sprinkled it on it looked like a shining star the container is small but it will go a long way worth buying . 
this product allows me to make some really big splashes when providing spiced nuts at gatherings the fact that the gold spreads so easily allows me to use just a little but show off people are amazed that this is edible gold . 
these radiation treated dinners that do n't need freezing are a great convenience i 've tried quite a few of the hormel compleats and this is one of my favorites home cookin' , it ai n't , and it 's a bit too salty , but for a satisfying meal in 90 seconds , it 's hard to beat the only reason i 've given this flavorful , decently chicken filled dish 4 stars instead of 5 is because the rice is white we all know by now that whole grains are healthier , so , until these companies start making their dishes with whole wheat pasta and brown rice , i 'll mark them down . 
i subscribe to several hormel compleats this is definitely the best flavored dinner i have tried i am planning to double my subscription . 
not so sure about this product chicken and rice is not really what there is sure there is some chicken and some rice but mostly gravy all in all i still like it . 
these dinners are as close to perfect as can be found here in the mountains quick , easy and delicious ! . 
i'm not so sure why the other guy did n't like this so much , i love it ! ! in fact , it might just be one of my favorite foods around it 's tried and true , rarely cooks wrong , and always good to warm the belly and soul i only but this flavor , it 's so good , why deviate from it \? i have tried other brands before , bit maruchan makes the best ramen noodles in all of time . 
im on a quest to try all the ramen flavors ramen is a good lunch for me , being easy to make , cheap and versital the chicken flavor is one i remember but i havent had it in a long time , its one of the only flavors sold in stores where i live i made some recently its better than i remember , salty but good this is one of the more americanized flavors i recommend not adding 2 cups of water i added a bit more than 1 1 4 cup and it was perfect 1 1 4 1 1 3 or 1 1 2 seems to be the perfect amount i like eating it as a soup so i dont pour out the water you can add things to ramen like meat , eggs , or vegetarian protein and frozen veggies to make it a more filling meal or eat it plain or dont use the seasoning packet and add your own seasonings whatever you like this is a great product , i recommend if you want easy , cheap lunches . 
this is a classic ramen choice our kids , 3 6 love this when we 're rving , we have a case of this on hand a bowl , some water , and 2 30 in the microwave , and we 've got our instant meal we break up the noodles while still sealed in the package this helps the kids not make a mess when trying to eat them they do n't seem to tire of these and we 're not overly offended by the nature of the just add water product we each had our ramen eating college days these also make a great item to have on hand in a desk drawer for the days you forget your lunch , etc at work just make sure you have a pack of paper \( not styro save the enviro \) bowls and some fork spoons in that drawer , too . 
if you want a hot meal with no effort that is delious this is the way while cooking noodles microwave left over meat hot dog boloni \( sp \? \) also , microwave a spoon or two of vegetable left over frozen canned after noodles cook add season packet pour over meat veg after a minute pour some of the liquid out you have a wonderful meal with less sodium because you poured it out ! college kids live off this meal because it is cheap quick and can all be done in microwave if need be you can get a case of libby 's carot peas from amazon for about 11 ! since you are using only a spoon or two lasts a long time ! . 
a bit dry but still good they may be perfectly all right i just thought the noodles were hard and dry br i'm still enjoying them . 
i ordered this 13 pack sampler , and i have to say that i really do like the flavor of the donut shop classics pods they are mellow , smooth , and have virtually no bitterness i just ca n't believe how fresh they manage to keep their pods i give them four stars because i prefer freshly roasted and ground , but to date , when i'm in a hurry in the mornings , which is most mornings , i reach for a pod of donut shop classics . 
with this spice mix , you can recreate the taste of your favorite restaurant stews it is potent , so do not use too much it smells heavenly perfect for both meat and bean stews . 
if you like garlic this is for you i 've been making this as a dip with greek yogurt and reduced fat mayonnaise i usually add chopped spinach to it and serve it with crudites and chips i have gotten rave reviews from my friends my only complaint is that it consists of dried vegetables and a powder and it is difficult to make sure they are equally distributed when measuring it out . 
i 've been eating the mcdougall right foods for a few years now , and this is by far the best it takes exactly the way the name suggests it tastes great with cooked vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower , and it is very easy to make the only problem i have with it is that the noodles are n't thick enough for me , but i think one time i let them sit in the microwave a little longer and they became thick other than that , i 'd recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and who enjoys noodles and peanut flavor . 
span class tiny length 1 38 mins br br span skip the pad thai go for this br edit this soup has moved up to the 6 spot when i typed in dr mcdougall today i'm glad , because i want to order this for a while , and do n't want this soup to be seen as unprofitable by right foods \( dr mcdougall \) . 
i love the mcdougall asian entr eacute es and although i have n't tried all of them this one is amazing it has a really peanutty flavor that you would n't expect in a product containing only 3 grams of fat per serving i would imagine these would make a great dinner added to a pound of mixed stir fry vegetables i am buying a case now to test just that ! the peanut flavor is strong enough that i bet it 'd distribute among a fair amount of vegetables or tofu when added so you would n't get very saucy noodles and dry veggies br br i recommend this product the best tasting peanut noodle you 'll be able to find for only 3 grams of fat . 
this is a very tasty item my wife does n't eat meat and had to stay br in a hotel for 4 weeks during a training she attended i had this shipped br to her and she raved about the great flavor and wanted more ! . 
sure , i could have gone on a food crusade at the local grocery to find a similar product but i do n't think i would have found a product as good and tasty as dr mcdougall the noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite i was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a thai food restaurant overall , i'm pleased with my order and the quality of the product . 
these are super tastey ! i would definitely recommend the only reason i'm not giving 5 stars is because i wish they were bigger ! d . 
super tasty quick meal it 's a bit small , but perfect for a lunch on the go definitely not going to help you with any dinner hunger pangs though br br the sodium is a little higher than i 'd like , but i really ca n't beat it for economic and efficient lunchfood . 
there are many workdays when i only have a few minutes for lunch or \( all too often \) dinner on these days , dr mcdougall 's products are lifesavers ! i keep some fresh , washed veggies in my office fridge and can have a great meal ready in 5 minutes just microwave this one , for instance , while cutting up some broccoli , peppers , a carrot , and whatever else i have around \( i also added half of a slim yellow squash the other day , cut in little twigs delicous ! \) by the time you 're through cutting , you 'll have finished with cooking the soup and the soup 's standing time will be almost over \( it needs a few minutes to thicken up \) take a tablespoon of the broth and a tablespoon of water , add the veggies and the liquid to a big bowl , toss the veggies in the liquid , and microwave for about 1 minute 30 seconds when through , dump the soup and noodles on top and you have a delicious , healthy meal the men in my office come sniffing around when the aroma of the soup comes out of the microwave several are now also fans , despite being initially worried by the fact that the meal is vegan when i am organized enough to remember to wash and bring it in , i add a spring onion on top \( i just use an office scissors to cut it \) if you can afford the calories , a few drops of toasted sesame oil is a nice addition , as well , as is tamari yummy ! . 
these papers are great , they leave a delicious strawberry taste on your lips even the glue tastes good . 
these smell so good and are cute and a great size , with a bend in the middle to help roll , and holds together really well with tasty glue definitely recommend smell like strawberry bubble gum , does n't really affect flavor too much , but better than plain ones and very sweet box says printed with soy ink so it 's clean and i do n't have to worry about ridiculous chemicals for the graphics . 
these rolling papers are great they taste amazing and they burn slow and also prevent tar from running down the paper . 
love this soup i have been eating this soup for a long time i have tried several different soups with these same types of ingredients , and this one is the best by far however , i will not order it from amazon again i ordered a case , two different times , and the first time 6 of the 12 cans were dented the second order , the postal worker delivered it to me in a plastic trash bag because 2 cans were busted open , the other 10 cans , were dented with the labels coming off of them because of getting wet from the soup that had leaked from the busted cans it was a huge mess to clean up they need to package items better amazon did issue a full refund , but after having 2 out of 2 shipments being damaged , i am not willing to order soup , or any other food items from them . 
excellent very nice , rich and creamy with the pistachio nut in the middle mmmm delish ! ! ! . 
if you want a good quick cooked sauce without excess acidity these are the ones to use the real san marzano , beware of imitators ! . 
long ago i discovered that san marzano tomatoes were unparalleled for flavor when it comes to making sauces i tried many brands , and have done many side by side tasting comparisons , and cento san marzano tomatoes have consistently won out these tomatoes have a deep and rich flavor , and a nice acid to sugar balance \( though you may need to enhance this when making a sauce \) it 's pretty obvious when you pull these tomatoes out of the can that they were picked at their ripest , due to their deep red color and soft texture many tomatoes advertise themselves as san marzanos , but since sm is a type of tomato , they could have been grown anywhere not these these are sm tomatoes grown in the san marzano region of italy , in volcanic soils perfect for growing tomatoes i have no affiliation with cento , i just love a perfect tomato sauce use these tomatoes , be sure to not cook the sauce for more than 15 minutes , and you 'll see what i mean even using fresh , locally grown , in season tomatoes i have n't been able to get the depth of flavor that i do with the centos . 
i wanted to make authentic italian margherita pizza at home so i ordered this and caputo 00 flour these tomatoes are amazing , and taste just liek the tomatoes at our favorite italian pizza restaurant the label says there is basil in it but i did not detect visually or in taste any basil this stuff is jsut awesome i ordered another 8 cans shipping kills though . 
as i was growing up my mother always made apple sauce cake for every birthday and special occasion after i was diagnosed with celiac i began trying to make a cake that was like the one my mother made after 6 years i gave up trying then i saw this mix in the store 2 years ago and got very excited with the prospects when i make the cake i tweak the mix recipe a little i add to the dry mix 1 4 cup coco , 1 2 cup chopped walnuts and 1 2 raisins i use 3 large eggs , 3 4 cup apple sauce , 1 3 cup of oil and 1 3 cup water instead of what is listed on the bag this cake and the chocolate cake mix also made by namaste are our family 's favorites this includes my husband and children who are not celiac and are very picky eaters ! . 
i served this wonderful cake at a christmas party at my house as the only celiac in the crowd , i decided to wait until the others had tried it , before revealing that it was gluten free everyone raved over the great taste ! the package included directions for making the mix into a carrot cake , which is how i served it my own two boys said it was the best cake i had ever made , including the traditional wheat flour cakes i sometimes make for the rest of my family it was moist , spicy , and rich it reminded me of the cakes my grandmother made when i was growing up , and she was a terrific cook i highly recommend this one ! . 
this product arrived with the sanitary seal in place and in good condition after nearly 10 months in iraq , being able to shake pepper out of this thing and smell it in the air is heaven compared to the tiny little pepper packets they give us that have little to no taste i really do love the smell of this pepper and it tastes great you may be better off buying it in the grocery store and not paying for shipping if you can manage that , though \) . 
not wanting to pay 9 per pound at the local mall for black jelly beans , i came to my favorite online store , amazon with free shipping i could not beat the price i went from paying 9 per pound to 3 50 per pound i was afraid that maybe the good deal meant that they were stale but to my suprise they were fresh and delicious i bought them for my mother for mother 's day because she did not get a chance to buy any for easter with 10 pounds , i had plenty to share with my friends too . 
these jelly beans are wonderful they are smaller than regular jelly beans but that does n't take away the flavor i would recommand these to anyone . 
licorice jelly beans use to be my absolute favorite in the jelly bean flavors \( i no longer eat sugar \) these were bought as a gift , so i did get to try a few just to see how they are i 've had many over the years before giving up on sugar and honestly have never had any with this good a flavor ! also their customer service is excellent ! i needed to contact them and they were very responsive and also willing to do just about anything to make sure even one customer is happy something lacking in most companies these days br to compare i tried a couple jelly belly licorice ones and to me they had a fruit flavor that was just wrong not enough of a licorice taste gimbal 's is less expensive this way and superior in every aspect of a licorice jelly bean this is a large quantity ! ! keep that in mind when purchasing either have a lot of jelly bean lovers in your life , or a large family or collection of friends to share with unless of course your sweet tooth wo n't stop and then , just savor them all yourself \) br enjoy ! . 
soy milk is scrumptious and this variety has some extra nutrients added it 's a great , nutritious , high calcium , no cholesterol product at a great price buy a case . 
this product is very good it goes a long way but quite as good as the one at dd good product not the less . 
i absolutely love the just tomatoes tomatoe slices i thought the bits might be good for soups etc , but they do n't seem to have the same sweet flavor of the slices i will ues these up , but go back to the slices on the whole , a great product . 
i toss some of these in soups , or hydrate in a bit of hot water and add to salads or salad dressings they add a nice somewhat meaty flavor , \( almost like bacon bits but healthy \) , to almost any dish . 
my question followed by their reply very good customer service ! ! br br hey guys , br so we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can , however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs br so a formula is in order as a supplement with that , we are interested in your toddler formula , and it appears that since this meets the fda infant formula guidelines , that it should be safe , \( and opinions on the internet seem to feel the same way \) however , our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous he was also concerned about using the dha ara supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant any thoughts on this \? thanks ! br br their answer br br dear dave , br br thank you for contacting nature 's one firstly , you are correct in that our baby 's only organic formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the fda 's infant formula act no dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age please follow label mixing instructions br br regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in baby 's only organic formulas , calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health the american academy of pediatrics expert panel for nutrient levels in infant formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 calories phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health the expert panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1 1 or more than 2 0 baby 's only organic falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1 5 br reference committee on nutrition , pediatric nutrition handbook , the american academy of pediatrics , 2009 , pages 1245 1246 br br the balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development the calcium to phosphorus ratio in both baby 's only organic formula and enfamil nextstep is 1 5 thus , baby 's only organic formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus br br regarding our baby 's only essentials dha ara supplement , the dha utilized in our baby 's only essentials dha ara supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids you are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk additionally , it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction because we use the phospholipids \( not protein \) from the egg yolk , there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue br br if your child has a history of allergies , we highly recommend that you consult your child 's healthcare provider br br dha is also found naturally in other foods , including oily fish like trout , sardines , tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs dietary ara is available from animal meats , dairy foods , eggs , peanuts and nori seaweed as your child increases the variety of foods in her diet , you can include some of these foods in her diet other natural sources of dha would include fish oil or fish oil supplements unfortunately , it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins but , also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids \( nuts , seeds , grains legumes , vegetables and their cold pressed oils \) by including good sources of high quality fats in the diet , your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs br br most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white egg yolk allergies are rare br br proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white these protein allergens are ovomucoid , ovalbumin , ovotransferrin lysozyme , and ovomucin br br however , there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy the literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen , referred to as bird egg syndrome this is a very rare syndrome br br egg allergy can also be seasonal oak pollen , short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season br br the estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1 6 by 2 5 years of age \( 1 \) again , egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age br br \( 1 \) eggesbo m , botten g , halvorsen r , magnus p , the prevalence of allergy to egg a population based study in young children , allergy 56 5 403 br br i hope this information is helpful to you thank you for your interest in baby 's only organic formulas please let me know if you have additional questions br br sincerely , br br lori br nature 's one inc br br br toll free . 
hands down the best formula on the market sadly , my breast milk dried up so i had to fine a formula my poor son has so many gi , stomach , gas , crying , reflux , etc issues we were on alimentum for over a month we even tried the ready to eat b c i heard it was corn free i also tried the hypoallergenic version by enfamel nothing made him better br br after researching dha ara i found some scary things basically , it is made by using chemicals there are some babies that have had a horrible reaction to this b c of the toxins you can google it anyway , i found this organic formula that did n't have it in it \( you can buy dha ara seperate made from eggs organically and no chemicals \) i was nervous b c my son had so many issues i did n't want to make it worse but i tried it ! seriously , it has changed my son 's life ! he is a completely different baby ! i no longer even give him acid reflux meds anymore i mean of course it is still there but that is how much better it is my son has been on this since he was 6 weeks i know it says toddler , but if you go to their site it is fda approved for infants they say toddler b c they fully support breast feeding for the first year it has the same cals , fats , nutrients , vit , minerals pretty much as the other leading brands it 's just organic no dha ara and they do n't use corn syrup seriously , try this formula ! . 
i ca n't believe i am the first to review this great product br br we have been using a href http www amazon com gp product b001bm4jlc earth 's best organic infant formula with iron , 25 75 ounce canister a \( which is also a great product \) up until our little started showing signs of lactose intolerance after consulting with the pediatrician , we started searching for a suitable alternative br br whilst soy formulas are being offered as the lactose free alternative by many , our first preference was non soy alternative we also wanted a natural organic product , free of those nasty chemicals and ingredients after a considerable amount of research and shopping around , we found this was the best choice out in the market that was both lactose free and natural organic br br our little one also took to this formula very well and doing a lot better on this formula . 
you can find this 6 pack for 40 dollars less at diapers com no reason they should be charging this much . 
our 9 month old originally was spitting up a lot we had him 1st on similac regular , then went to similac sensitive and finally to similac soy the soy did the trick he was on similiac soy for the past 6 months when the similac recall went through , my wife became disgusted with similac and suggested we try a new brand i was reluctant but did so anyway we reminded ourselves that as babies get older , they become less fussy , less gassy and maybe they do n't need soy anymore if that 's what they were used to so i went to my local whole foods store and bought the lactose free baby 's only formula an instant hit ! ! ! ! ! my son loves it ! seriousely he gobbles it down all 6 oz in once shot before with the similac soy , he would have to take a break in between my wife actually tasted the milk and said it is delicious compared to similac soy well , if adults like it , i am sure babies would too ! i am very happy thus far with our choice we were going to get natures best , but read that the way they extract their dha is not ideal glad i realized that so far so good ! we always thought that our baby would be stuck with soy formula thank 's to the similac recall and some good old fashioned parent intuition , we realized that is not the case i am happy about that since soy can cause some hormonal problems babies and adults alike thank you baby 's only for making an excellent product ! . 
when my daughter was an infant , she was allergic to something in my breastmilk and was put on neocate which worked wonders for her allergic colitis for my son , we were therefore very careful when it came time to picking out a formula to supplement breastmilk his stomach does react when i have accidentally had more dairy than i can tolerate so my pediatrician recommended a lactose free formula , especially given our asian background i wanted something organic , not soy , lactose free , and with as clean of a label as possible and this formula fulfills all of those criteria my son did n't like it at first , but now he switches easily between breastmillk and formula he has not been gassy nor spit up on it i really wish amazon stocked it . 
i love pasta , but it does not love me i just do n't seem to be able to digest it but this pasta , not only tastes great , it is so easy to digest and , as an added bonus , it is healthy low in calories i have now tried every version of this pasta they are all amazing some reviewers complained that the pasta is too firm , but that is not the case you simply need to cook it a bit longer than regular pasta then it is light as a feather because of how wonderful it tastes because it is so light , you would think that you were eating homemade pasta almost hard to beleive that this stuff comes out of a box ! \) . 
i eat this pasta every day , without guilt i love this pasta i maintain my desired weight without any problem you have to cook this pasta a little longer than normal pasta , but it is every bit as good . 
each box is 8oz and usually i make 8oz mixed with some lean protein for a meal for both my husband and i , and if we have leftovers , it 's rare this time however , i had half of it leftover only b c we felt full and could n't eat anymore i wonder if this is b c of the high amt of fiber whatever , this morning my hubby tells me he 's down 3 lbs too i'm jealous also , i 've been on an eating binge almost 2 weeks , always feeling unsatiated last night i had no strong urges to eat snacks i ate an apple more out of habit to eat something than b c i was truly hungry i wo n't say this is the outcome for everyone , but i thought i 'd share i'm using the leftover pasta in my bean soup tonight i 'd like to eventually try the different varieties of shapes of pasta now , too . 
i love this stuff and only get it through amazon it arrived on time and good condition and i enjoy it . 
just a quick note a very good friend of mine who also battles weight issues and love pasta turned me on to this product we bought a box at whole foods and i was impressed by the taste but especially by the low calories and high fiber content amazingly it 's about 40 cheaper at amazon than at whole foods , and being an amazon prime customer saved me on shipping br i 'll be back for more soon i love quality and a bargain . 
love this pasta i mix this with regular pasta for a meal , half and half love the lower calories and the fiber content . 
my husband and i have been on a low carb diet for two years and i miss pasta most of all we 've tried other low carb pastas and were n't crazy about them , but we loved fiber gourmet the taste is midway between white and whole wheat pasta unlike other low carb pastas , we did n't experience any side effects in terms of digestive issues \( if you know what i mean \) i ca n't wait to try other products from fiber gourmet . 
love this pasta does cook up a little firm , cooked it a bit longer had it with pesto very good my husband could not tell the difference so i know it is good he is very fussy . 
wow this pasta tastes just like the real thing unlike the brands labeled as whole wheat pasta i tried them many times and simply could not get the same pasta eating experience i eat half the box at a time , which is about 4 ozs , and it 's so filling i ca n't eat more if i wanted it keeps me satiated all night i do n't even get the urge to snack this is like a miracle to me even my children who are the absolute pickiest eaters in the world love this pasta and will eat it in substitute for the real \( and unhealthy \) alternative the other reviews are absolutely correct in that you should cook it 2 5 minutes longer than you would cook other pasta or even what the box says i'm not sure if amazon will like this comment , but it is much cheaper on the fiber gourmet web site at about double the amount for the same price on the day i am writing this review . 
i am on a low carb diet and have lost 25 pounds i was so tired of eating meat all the time but too nervous to splurge on pasta until i came across this product on amazon i cook it a minute or two longer than the directions and top it with full fat greek yogurt and parm cheese and one serving is so filling and yummy definitely cures my cravings and am now on subscribe and save my hubby and son love it too ! . 
i do n't know how they do it but this product is too good to be true half the calories of regular pasta ! ! wow . 
great product recommended by dr oz we love pasta but not the calories this is much better than whole wheat . 
i brought a box with me to visit my daughter and family br we all enjoyedjthe fiber gourmet light penne very much . 
first of all , it is wonderful to have these pods delivered to my door free of charge on auto delivery , they are cheaper than the cheapest senseo pods that i have found \( target walmart \) but check out the weight of coffee per senseo pod vs this particular baronet coffee pod not all baronet pods are this weight , however , so check out the products carefully i guess i had better mention that the coffee flavor is great ! one order is for three boxes of these pods . 
these pods are so much better than the senseo pods ! at 10 grams , these pods are packed with more coffee than the senseo pods , making for a better , stronger , more flavorful cup of coffee i use these in my melitta one one also love that each pod is individually packaged , so they stay fresh they come in a stand up box dispenser which is nice too i ca n't understand the other reviewer here who did n't like the coffee i love this decaf ! it really is the best pod i 've found also the value here ca n't be beat comes 3 boxes in each order , so in each order you get 54 pods ! and baronet has so many flavors do check on the other baronet flavors , though , because all the baronet pods are not 10 grams , and all the pods do n't come individually packaged stick to the 10 gram , individually packaged pods , you wo n't be disappointed i get three different baronet coffee pod flavors , all on auto delivery highly recommend yum . 
i am enjoying this coffee but the vanilla is a little overpowering the strength of the coffee itself is very good i can use one packet to make 2 4 oz cups with the senseo coffee maker so it definitely saves me money plus , it is just so easy to make coffee and clean up in the morning ! . 
i had been using a href http www amazon com gp product b000ubh9ye senseo decaffeinated coffee , 18 count pods \( pack of 6 \) a in my a href http www amazon com gp product b0043xylaa hamilton beach personal cup stay or go pod brewer a although the senseo coffee is very good , i wanted some variety this is what i found and its excellent the vanilla flavor is rich and most importantly , leaves no after taste i drink tall cups , 16 oz , so what i am doing is using 1 of each type the vanilla is strong enough that it still tastes great the senseo decaf is a little cheaper , so i do that as a cost saving measure i also signed up for subscribe and save to further reduce cost if you like vanilla coffee and have a pod brewer , i am confident you will love this coffee . 
so many different flavors to choose from i ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful it was the only decaf french vanilla i could find i have decided to switch from my old brand to this one . 
this by far the best pudding mix , you do n't see this on the store shelves everyone seems to just buy milk chocolate pudding and i guess most do n't like to cook pudding on the stove , it is best when pudding is cooked cooked instant pudding does not equal this carl . 
we 've been searching everywhere locally for this putting i was so elated to find it on amazon this is the only pudding my mother made her chocolate pies with and now the tradition continues thank you so much amazon ! ! ! . 
my honey has a serious sweet tooth , which i accommodate by preparing him a weekly dessert martha white 's muffin mix is very convenient to prepare because it only requires one half cup of milk , which i toss into my cuisinart and wah la six beautiful muffins with virtually no prep time they are moist , delicious , and economic . 
i followed the easy instructions and these turned out delicious i ate them all there were only 6 of them i mixed 1 2 cup of milk into the dry mix and slowly mixed it together i poured the mix into my sprayed cast iron 6 cup muffin pan i cooked them in my small convection oven and they cooked up nicely they were moist on the inside the mixes were very fresh smelling and had a freshness date well into 2013 the pouch is a nice tough plastic one and will keep the mix fresh it is very easy to open also . 
we love love love these muffins they are moist and delicious ! ! we like them best the day you bake them the 2nd day they do dry out a bit but are wonderful if you pop them in the toaster oven for a few min to warm them up , then they are good as new our only complaint is that they are difficult to find ! ! but def worth every penny ! ! . 
this was my first time purhcasing muffin mix as well as baking muffins to me the muffins came out a little dry , but tasted great and the people i shared them with said they were good too i will , more than likely , purchase marth white muffin mix in the future the muffin mix came at an excellent price and i ca n't complain br thank you amazon com for having most everything under the sun for sale . 
i brought 2 bottles one i carry in my pocket and the other for home i fell in love with this while on vacation in belize just a couple drops does the trick packs a ton of flavor , but not too hot that it overpowers your food . 
good product and decent shipping however , the price was 15 95 and i later found the same item in a local store for 6 95 what a gouge . 
the taste of thai coconut ginger noodles are really yummy ! the coconut and ginger flavors are very mild br br each recloseable , chinese takeout shaped box conveniently serves as a microwaveable container one box makes enough for me to have 2 very filling lunches or for my whole family to share as a side dish \( the kids always lunge at the opportunity to have these ! \) br br the only negative thing i can say is that i wish there were n't so many separate little seasoning packets to mix in \( 3 , plus the noodles \) a single combined spice packet would be easier \( of course , one benefit of multiple packets is the ability to leave out a certain spice if you 're not fond of it , but i like them all ! \) . 
provided you use clean \( preferably purified \) water to cook this , it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part , gluten and meat free \( except for the shrimp flavor \) br br while some people have remarked on the over sized packaging , this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage br br while the coconut ginger variety tastes good , it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual taste of thai i 'd recommend the thai peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced thai flavor and highly recommend the a taste of thai peanut salad dressing \( added to salads , meats or the peanut noodles \) for a very spicy thai experience br br overall for the taste and quantity , the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal comparatively speaking in terms of price , wal mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper \( compared to the subscription price \) but do not seem to carry the coconut ginger variety at least not at the store near me br br if you have n't tried this brand of instant noodles yet , i think you 'll be in for a treat . 
i really like this soup it is mild and i do n't like anything that is to hot it is just right has a good flavor and is something i can take to work and pop in the microwave i would buy it again and again . 
this is quick , easy and portable , and i think it tastes great ! it 's my favorite flavor . 
it 's very tasty and very easy to make if you 're in need of a very quick , filling meal and it needs to be gluten free , this works out great try the thai peanut one , too . 
we ordered a pack of these and ate through them very quickly ! my husband and i both like taking them to work for lunch here 's my recipe , so that i get more protein i slip a fresh unbroken egg into the box before i leave home in the morning , then i add the egg to the water before i cook it at lunchtime . 
very tasty gluten free option my kids loved it as it was n't too spicy . 
the thai coconut ginger noodles are quick and easy to prepare you will be rewarded with delicious noodles to enjoy by yourself or share as a side dish with another noodle enjoyer . 
i liked this so much that i re ordered and will keep br br re ordering . 
this is a great and delicious way to eat thia food at home just melt the entire packet \( if you like it spicy \) into two cans of coconut milk in a pan then add your favorite meat and veggies i usually use chicken strips and a bag of frozen asian veggies . 
while the restaurants always do it best , these curry pastes are pretty tasty it 's easy to use , fast , and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice for those of you scared of something spicy , you might use a little less , but for most , it 's just right , and for those that like it spicier , you can add a little crushed red pepper since the coconut milk has to be added separately , you can also control the fat content you can go light or go with the much yummier , creamy stuff i find the green curry is a little sweeter than the red and panang curries , and is maybe a little less spicy . 
much hotter than your normal green curry one pack makes many servings . 
used to use another brand \( that changed \) , in a jar , but this is so much better ! has a very pleasing hot spicy taste with a hint of lemon lime and a good amount of heat it is a little too salty though , if you like to use a fair amount to spice it up we wish it had a lower sodium content while , made from scratch with fresh ingredients is always better this is the next best thing ! really good with chicken , beef , pork , tofu and veggie dishes quick and easy to make good for you meals we do n't like the packaging and wish it were in a jar , but other than that and the sodium content , we like it will buy again ! . 
second order very good , hot which i like but best to sample as per your preferences . 
i was really impressed with this there are many flavors , and quite a bit of heat with this and your favorite brand of cocunut milk you can make some great thai curries at home . 
different flavors for different people not everyone is going to like this just as others , like me , will love this coffee br br it 's totally subjective br br i give it 5 stars i enjoy this coffee a lot and the price is very reasonable , in my opinion it matches my local big box grocery store . 
i was at a 5 star hotel and was served this tea during a meeting it was fantastic i asked the server if they could get me the name of the company , but they were unable thank goodness for amazon i was able to find it it 's the best i have had in many years it arrived on time and very securely packed . 
i totally love this tea it brews to a beautiful reddish color it is very aromatic and beautiful to look at it could be potpourri i love the sachets it comes in very elegant i just bought my third canister of it this morning i have everyone at my office and my friends loving it , too ! best with honey pearls also sold by white lion tea and it 's organic ! . 
this stuff rocks ! ! ! i 've had it at two different spas and i just love it it 's tart and really unusual a real treat . 
this is my husband 's new favorite tea ! i'm not huge on hibiscus but this does taste good i'm sure we 'll be buying more . 
nice tea i can steep up too 3 times it has a strong cranberry flavor probably would be good as a cold tea i recommend if you love cranberry . 
i found this tea 5 years ago , while staying at a spa resort in washington br br i absolutely love it ! it 's herbal , and helps me to relax with its very flavorful taste and color great for colds , as well as clearing the sinus soothing , beautiful , and delicious ! br br i have ordered this tea every year , from amazon com , because the price is amazing , and well worth it likewise , i 've given it to others as a gift , when i can afford to br br this tea is wonderful with honey , sugar , sweetener , or just by itself ! a must purchase for every household also great for on the road , for tea drinkers . 
love it , love it , love it ! both me and my 10 year old drink this herbal tea quite often very tasty ! . 
this is very good tea in an elegant sachet a little pricier than some but produces a wonderful flavor whether you 're drinking it hot or cold . 
my doggie really likes newman 's organic better than some other dog foods pet and big box stores sell my budget does n't like newman 's organic as much as harmony farms it 's the compromise that keeps the doggie and my budget happy because he eats it heartily , i do n't worry that he 's getting enough high quality food otherwise he wo n't eat his food and he 'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void br br there 's no barfing , digestion problems or accidents high quality food means good digestion , a shiny coat , high energy , bright eyes and a good attitude without tons of additional elixers , treats or vet bills a definite cost effective win win for doggie and me br br i 've had great results with newman 's dog food that i orderd through amazon but there 's 5 pounds less for about the same price br br psst i'm not an organic fanatic , it 's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids ! br br update 3 26 2011 noticed this has jumped to almost thirty bucks , will opt for newman 's organic when the costs per pound are the same my dog likes both harmony and newman , my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase \) br br update 5 17 2012 last batch of harmony farms i ordered had a rancid oil smell when i opened the bag and the pooch would n't eat it as readily as he has in the past he would n't eat for a day and started checking out the trash i subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods , cooked brown rice etc as mix ins to encourage him to make it through this pricey bag not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home , but the texas heat can make anything stale rancid yucky quickly i probably should have called customer service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the hot weather here definitely exploring hot weather alternatives . 
a few years back , prompted by the death of one of our dogs due to an inoperable brain tumor , i switched my dogs to foods without corn i was convinced , right or wrong , that my animal died needlessly because of an over usage of steriods prescribed to cure her constant ear infections i believe , again right or wrong , that the recurring ear infections were caused by an allergy to corn which turned out to be the main ingredient in her food ! sorry , i 'll get off my soapbox and address the issue at hand i found this food by accident the only type the store had was the weight loss formula turns out my dogs love it ! i have n't seen them so spunky and full of energy i 've got a coon hound and two jack russells \( mine are not the bounce off the wall kind , mine are mellow , laid back kinda dudes ! \) they gobble this stuff up and seem to stay full no more begging in the kitchen than normal ! everyone 's skin seems smoother , eyes are brighter , heck , i think i 'll go have a bowl ! all i can say , is if you are looking for a good quality dog food , this is the one for you you will not be disappointed ! . 
i have a 2 year old portuguese water dog who always seemed to have a sensitive stomach , and a 15 year old shepherd x dog who was beginning to lose weight , she slept almost all the time , and she was getting very fussy about what she 'd eat \( i believe that with a dogs sense of smell they know exactly what is in their food however they have no choice but to eat what we feed them just google what is in most commercial dog foods , and you 'll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it up if a dog can detect cancer in a person , they can detect all sorts of other things that are n't supposed to be eaten \) anyway i used to feed purina lamb and rice to my dogs , but i was finding my young porty was having trouble with it , and my 15 yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish so , i started making their food , and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe the dogs loved my homemade dog food , and my 15 yr old began putting on weight again , but i did n't always have time to make their food and , homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet so , i started to research all the natural dog foods out there , compare costs etc i arrived on harmony farms , and guess what my dogs love it just as much as they love my home made dog food my young porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great my 15 yr old finishes her meals and looks for more both have shiny coats and energy no one can believe my old girl is 15 years old i have told my friends about harmony farms dog food , and when they 've switched over , they 've reported similar positive results my brother in law 's dog had always been a very fussy eater , and had skin problems with a thinning coat when they started to feed her harmony farms , she became an eager eater , more happy and outgoing , and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up \( i'm thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food , which i think was iams \) other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now and they had all been feeding their dogs premium , top of the line dogs foods and paying top of the line prices harmony farms products are very reasonably priced not the cheapest dog food on the shelf , but , in my opinion , you are buying the best quality food on the market , so it 's an incredibly good deal ! it may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarian 's office i and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs \) . 
my co worker that does animal rescue brought in a 'whole dog journal' recently and i was astounded at the feature article for that month which covered dog foods , i had been feeding my dog beneful which is basically just junk food i switched her off immediately , hunted around on amazon to find an all natural food and this fit the bill , shipping was free which was awesome and my dog loves the food , i worried about that b c i 've switched her before and she 's been uninterested and i 've had to top with gravy , etc br br do your research , it will blow your mind what your pets are eating in regular grocery store dog food , it 's typically a high ratio of corn which is a filler if you want your pet to live a long and healthy life what they 're ingesting should be high up on your list i'm glad to have the knowledge now and i really wish i 'd looked more into this with my two other dogs years and years ago . 
no more heavy grocery bags for me i 've just ordered my first bag of harmony farms dog food and it was delivered to my door by ups the food is excellent quality i bought this product based on its healthy ingredients the dogs love it and i love amazon for making it so easy to buy ! br br july 2010 one of my dogs has had bouts of inflammatory bowel disease previously she had to have special food from my vet \( royal canaan duck potato for the past 4 years \) she has tolerated , even thrived on , the harmony farms food w o any problems each bag of harmony farms is about 20 cheaper than the royal canaan hard to fight i am a believer br br the canned food is great , too br br september 2011 my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past \( verified by surgery \) has never felt better she is a wire and has the energy of a 2 yr old dog \( she is 7 \) she is not on any daily medication this healthy weight formula has helped her to thrive enough protein , not too much fat seem to do the trick i highly recommend it . 
i was using castor and pollux from amazon for my dog and i decided to try something different my dog dug into this dog food right away ! it has helped to maintain her rough coat so that it is softer and smoother and this food really helps keep her weight at a healthy level br br i catch my cat sneaking over to my dog 's food bowl and eating this food , too i have to look into getting her some harmony farms ! i can do this because harmony farms is really good quality food that is affordable . 
i just ordered this , came today and thought i would just try it , well to my amazement , my little daisy ate it and wanted more my little dog is just 8 yrs but has trouble with flare ups with her pancreas , i have to avoid fats and corn with her and she needs more fiber i have been making her dog food , but she missed eating the dry , i wondered if it was small enough for her to chew , but it was . 
had been feeding my 3 hounds purina one \( which they liked \) and thought i 'd try this since it 's not much more and i liked the ingredients they love it and i plan to order more in the future ! . 
everyone should know this is a healthier dog food than walmart brands , like purina , iams , or god forbid moist meaty ingredients like ground flax seed , peas , whole carrots , whole sweet potatoes , apples , blueberries and probiotics and the lack of sweeteners , by products , and low quality corn show this to be true br br i just did a taste test with this harmonic farms and my dogs old iams proactive health and decided to make the results known i let him smell both thoroughly without letting him eat at first , and placed the two piles a bit apart he immediately went for the harmonic farms , finished it and did n't even look at the iams before coming back to me wagging his tail hoping for more br br dogadvisor com made me aware of my past mistakes in dog food choices and i was hoping to god he would not shy away from the healthy organic stuff like i do to my great welcome surprise , he did n't ! i guess he 's a hippie at heart i on the other hand , will take my nachos bell grande . 
our ten year old doxie annie never , that 's right , never would eat any dry food until harmony farms healthy holistic chicken brown rice adult dog food that we bought from you ! every day we are in shock when she finishes each and every nugget of this dry dog food ! amazon you are truly amazing and we are so grateful that we bought this 17 5 pound bag of harmony farms dog food from you we 'll be ordering again and again from you as soon as we head towards the end of the current bag wow ! so happy about this . 
harmony farms produces excellent dog food products ! our 8 month soft coated wheaten terrier is sensitive to gluten , corn meal and other products generally found in the popular brands we were preparing to take him to the vet at about 4 months old b c he had great difficulty eliminating to the point of whining as he would attempt to go after more research on the breed we purchased harmony farms at a local store it was expensive but quickly resolved our puppy 's digestive issues after 5 8 days on only harmony farms products our puppy was happy and healthy ! br br i was so happy to find harmony farms on amazon ! it is more economical and delivered right to our door our puppy , connor , eats only harmony farms dog food and treats and is a much happier puppy now definitely recommend it for soft coated wheaten terriers and other breeds that have difficulty digesting the popular brands . 
wish i would have known a long time ago what a difference this dog food makes my 6 year old jack russell has always had the worst shedding problem and i recently read that excessive is a sign of poor nutrition \( was feeding her p urina dog chow \) she 's only been on this dog food for two weeks and i can noticeably tell a difference in the shedding ! she loves the taste and i love the price for such a good quality dog food . 
when i purchased the harmony farms healthy weight formula , i had a mini dachshund and jack russel terrier both of them love it i have added a shih tzu to my pack and she loves it , also i would highly recommend it to others the kibble is just the right size for small dogs . 
the main ingredients in this dog food are so much better than the ingredients in the common grocery store brands , and it tends to be less expensive than specialty brands my dog 's coat looks shiny and he seems much healthier since we switched to this food about a year ago the other nice thing is that target sells this brand , so if you ever find yourself at the end of the bag and you have n't ordered more in time , you can stop by target . 
i am very pleased with this dog food my sheltie has a good coat and good movements with harmony farms does much better with this food than others he is a very picky eater , so i do add chicken and he will eat we will stick with harmony farms i also like the bag , it helps keep the food fresh . 
my dog loves this food , and she has maintained her healthy weight for many years the vet is very happy with her general health , coat , and teeth having the 16lb bag sent directly to my home without any shipping charges is terrific ! the 16 lb size is not available in my area . 
while on a family camping trip with josh our 8yr old golden , we ran out of dog food stopped at a wegman 's market in erie pa to shop for a quality food settled on the harmony farm 's chicken josh liked it right away br we 've been mixing it with his normal food \( canidae \) br he 's very healthy and playful , his coat is shiny he 's a happy pup . 
my dog loves , loves this dog food i had to say love twice , because this dog food is one of his dog 's favorite . 
i have purchased this product once before from amazon it was delivered promptly and in tact this is the only food our dog will eat and we used to purchase it at petsmart in new york but in arizona , it is no where to be found this food is holistic and has no unnatural products at all we try to give our dog good quality dog food and this was it so now we go through amazon and our dog is quite happy bought a double amount to receive free shipping it was a very good deal . 
i have a nearly 1 year old golden retriever standard poodle mix , and a 6 year old german shepherd the doodle gets the chicken and brown rice \( just switched her a few weeks ago from nutro max \) and the shepherd gets the healthy weight i have tried several different foods for the doodle , and many of them caused problems like diarrhea and stinky , stinky farts with this , while switching from the nutro max , she had none of those problems in fact , i only took 5 days to switch her instead of 2 or so weeks , and she did n't have any digestive problems both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective several dollars cheaper at my local wegman 's and there are always coupons in the paper this is a very high quality food for the price , and i like that it 's available at the grocery store as i live in a small town i highly recommend this food and hope to feed it exclusively for as long as my doggies shall live ! . 
my dogs have been eating this brand for a few years now and having found it available through amazon i am able to save money per pound and trips to the store it arrives promptly and is the same quality as always harmony farms is much easier to digest and healthier than most commercial foods love it ! . 
i purchased this because of the good reviews and the great ingredients no doubt about the quality of the food and my 5 month old dachuhund puppy loves it but i realized this does n't have dha that helps to develop cognitive brain function also the kibble might be little big for a puppy so i believe it 's a great food for an adult dog , but i would n't recommend it for a puppy . 
this dog food satisfies both of my dogs and they have had no digestion problems or skin issues , as they have had with other brands they both have maintained healthy weights and glossy coats on this food i have been very pleased with the automated delivery service . 
since i live in a rural area sometimes i 'd drive to town just for dog food needless to say that was expensive for 26 w free shipping the harmony farms is cheaper than the purchasing the lower quality name brands my dog likes the food and his skin is not as dry flaky i love getting it shipped directly and that my dog is eating something healthy very thankful it 's something i can afford as well only wish amazon offered a 'subscription service' for this item like they do on others . 
i am always pleased with the variety of shopping items , that i find on amazon com br i have never been disatified with my purchases through amazon com br when searchomg for things , even dog food , i automatically go to amazon com br before any other site rarely do i chose another site amazon com br really rocks thanks for being there ! br j meadows , syracuse , ny . 
i just switched my 11 and a half year old boxer to this food and it is awesome ! she switched over no problems with no weaning off her old food it has cut her gas down and has been so easy on her stomach it also tastes so good to her that she will eat it without wet food mixed in i wish i had found this food 11 years ago it is great and we will switch our boxer puppy to it when it is time also very affordable \) . 
in my opinion , this is the best food for dogs my boyfriend is an avid researcher , and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts taste \( the dogs love it \) , health wise \( it has healthy fats , and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn \) and digestion wise \( the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food \) we have two dogs we adopted from a shelter , and while at first , one of our dogs would not eat the food \( he had worms though , so who knows what junk he was eating before \) , he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon , he came to love it now they jump when it 's dinner time ! our dogs are happy , very healthy , have shiny coats , and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food we get it on subscribe and save and we usually go through 1 bag p month for reference , we have one 15lb bichon and one alaskan husky . 
i have 2 husky shepherd mixes the first is 13 months and has a finicky stomach if he eats too fast , drinks too fast , or eats anything out of his routine , he would bring it back up he also would n't eat more than a few nibbles at a time the 2nd is 7 months old and came to us with severe diarrhea \( vet 's food did n't fix it either \) he would eat anything and everything if we let him within a day of both dogs being on harmony farms \( no fasting , just a quick switch \) , both dogs digestive issues are gone my oldest \( the finicky eater \) is healthily eating his meals without pause or hesitation my youngest has solid , regular bathroom breaks and has been able to relax his water intake as a result they 're both more relaxed br we purchase at our local grocery store \( hannaford here in ny \) for about 1 31 lb for the price , ingredients , and results you ca n't beat it . 
these chips are wonderful my kids and i all loved the salt and pepper br each 8 oz bag was 100 calories , lots of chips for the calorie count . 
great packaging , and item is just as described will purchase this item again they were shipped very fast , and efficient . 
just to give a little background i ordered these because they were a great deal for a box of single serving chips and i thought i would give them a try the variety of flavors in this package was great and i enjoy most of them these chips leave a lot less mess than your average bags of potato chips and there are very few crumbs in the bag it is apparent these are not prepared like normal chips and the result is a differently textured chip it will be a personal taste as to whether or not you will like the taste and texture , but , i would highly recommend trying these out . 
got this item on a one day only sale on amazon love having the single serving portion as i am following ww plan only 3 points plus per serving tasty and on the same line as the special k crackers the variety is nice to have and the box will last for awhile cheddar and bbq are my favorites try them . 
i discovered pop chips awhile back and fell in love with the bbq flavor whole lotta flavor and satisfying snack or chip alternative hubby is a teacher , so he gets lunches made most days with healthier and tastier options than what is offered at school br br since i mix up his sandwiches offerings from week to week , i thought the variety pack would be different for him he gets his crunchy fun and does n't realize the pop chips are n't as bad for you than the reduced fat kettle chips he was getting score ! plain are fine , vinegar pack a tart punch and he really likes the salt and pepper flavor single serve size does leave you wanting more if consuming solo , but gives a good amount when enjoying with a sandwich . 
i really liked these chips as did my entire family i wish you could pick and choose the flavors in the variety pack i would love to try the sweet potato and chili lime and leave the salt and pepper behind . 
i like these pop chips a lot , but not all the flavors this variety pack makes a good sampler of the various flavors and then you can purchase the flavors you like these chips have strong flavor and are not greasy they are fairly filling and make a great snack they 're pretty noisy \( like most chips \) so do n't take 'em to the local theater ! br br these came well packed and they are in stay fresh packaging i can attest that they do keep well for a pretty long time as i found a bag that had gotten pushed behind some other things , and after several months it still tasted fine \) br br these are a pretty good size for a quick snack quality has been consistent over several different batches i really like the texture and crunch , and love the lack of greasiness . 
these tastes good if it 's not fried , not bad for you , and tastes good , then why not eat them \? of course , not a lot at once , but these are great healthier snacks . 
i had only tried the barbeque and sea salt and vinegar flavors that were available at my local target in 3oz bags i am so glad that i bought this variety pack ! not only did i discover other flavors that i enjoy , but it 's single serving size so it 's better for portion control i love popchips , and i find them way more satisfying than ordinary potato chips ! . 
i like these chips a lot ! now i have a whole 24 pack ! this is how i get my chips on while i fish ! . 
a while ago i got a bag of the bbq at a store to go with my lunch and i loved these so when i was searching amazon and found these on subscribe and save i knew that this was something that i had to have for my lunches i love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet i have not found a flavor i did not like being from england i am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as i would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors i ca n't complain i also love the fact that 5 fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack my only issue now is that i have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as i do i have now had to go to a box a month but even then i am not sure i can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can . 
good flavorful chips too bad the selection does not include jalape ntilde o or paramsan garlic packaging is difficult to open , but they fresh . 
these are a great alternative to traditional greasy potato chips great for people that are dieting but still craving a salty , crunchy snack they are light and crunchy and they taste really good i was afraid they were going to be like the rice cakes and soy chips but they really taste good the original flavor reminds me a lot of the munchos chips the original flavor and salt vinegar are my favorite but they are all good my least favorite is the cheddar just because it is an overwhelming cheddar flavor \( i do n't like cheddar \) but most people really like it i have purchased these several times now and i will continue to do so i highly recommend this product for anyone ! . 
for all of you potato chips lovers who are trying to eat healthy , these chips are a great alternative ! no they are not like fried , but the flavor along with the calorie fat benefits make this a great choice ! i liked having the variety pack for the opportunity to see which flavors i would like as it turns out , i like them all ! but i do have my favorites \( like bbq , salt vinegar , and plain \) so being able to buy them singlularly is an added plus i have already placed two orders since my initial purchase ! . 
i got these for my gf as she is n't supposed to eat any gluten all of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips if you are looking for a gluten free snack , i highly recommend popchips ! . 
i like all the varieties except the salt and pepper they taste too much like black pepper and nothing else the others are very goodl a href http www amazon com gp product b001rvfdoo popchips 6 flavor variety pack , 0 8 ounce single serve bags \( pack of 24 \) a . 
the products are wonderful and fresh ! ! everything reported about the chips is on target , and i would recommend them to others amazon 's services are fantastic ! ! . 
i really enjoy these low calorie chips they have a good flavor with a good crunch and are crisp br br i was wondering if when ordering a case of these chips one could order their favorites and not the whole 6 flavors \? say just 2 flavors if desired \? \? br br its a great product do n't stop manufacturing them . 
these are really good tasting chips , they are n't too unhealthy so you can eat a fair amount love the flavoring . 
i have been trying to find healthy snacks that taste good and boy have i found a great choice in popchips ! these are a great healthier alternative for regular potato chips i love special k cracker chips , but they only come in big bags i saw these and they are packaged the way i like \( individual serving bags \) , so i gave them a try now , i will never be without them ! they are sooooo good and there are a lot of chips in each bag finally a good tasting , healthier potato chip that i can enjoy ! . 
i was n't sure about these chips , but thought i would give them a try these are tasty , crispy chips and only 100 calories a bag ! i like all the flavors included in the variety pack i definitely will buy again . 
these chips are very tasty , its a nice size serving and only 100 calories good grab and go snack for busy moms . 
the popchips were great and they were fresh when they arrived for the price , i wish there were more bags of chips for my bucks . 
aboulutely love popchips ! i first tried these healthy chips at a marathon i did in california i like this variety pack because i got to try alot of the flavors ive never had . 
this product was everything and more according to the advertisement i was totally satisfied with my purchase i recommend to everyone to purchase these chips from this site . 
popchips is a new product for me ordered after seeing an ad in weight watchers magazine loved the product packing was perfect shipping went fine no complaints with this order at all probably will order again soon ! . 
i have to watch my calories , but i tend to not be very successful if the food i eat is tasteless i have enjoyed all six flavors of these popchips and feel great eating them at 100 calories per bag my favorites are sour cream onion and the sea salt and vinegar flavors in fact , they 're so good i just want to keep eating them and have to resist opening a second bag , because that really defeats the purpose ! i like the variety pack and it 's not a bad value . 
the product is exactly what it is portrayed to be tasty \( not yummy \) but good i received the product promptly i ordered 2 cases and will eat every package . 
i love these chips , they taste so good i am on a low cal diet and they are perfect the individual bags keep you honest thank you popchips . 
these are delicious my husband and i just love them especially the bbq and salt and vinegar flavors i like the individual packages it 's a wonderful bargain when you get free shipping ! . 
i'm a crunchaholic ! i have to have something during the day to crunch ! all other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on popchips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too ! i highly recommend them all , but the salt and pepper are my least favorite ! . 
these are the best snacks for me as i am a lap band patient they fill u up just enough and the small bags are perfect size . 
a dream for those on weight watchers who love potato chips the individual serving bags of pop chips are only 3 points and taste delicious . 
these are a great size and healthy they satisfy the craving for something crisp and are reasonable calorie wise . 
these chips are great substitute for the usual high calorie ones offered ! i keep them on hand to aid in my weight loss venture . 
i ca n't believe these are actually decent for you they taste awesome ! i love these chips , they have great crunch and a great amount of flavor i am addicted to these and so is my boyfriend \( who hates anything that 's healthy \) i recommend these to all my friends i'm on the auto refill program but keep having to reorder early since my bf keeps eating them all . 
i am on weight watchers and these chips are only 3 points and they taste great i like every kind , i use the plain chips to dip with my salsa i would recomend these chips to everyone weight watchers or not . 
this is a great product i was a chip a holic and knew i needed to cut back on them then i was introduced to pop chips i have found my alternative these chips are great ! low in fats but high in flavor i purchsed a mixed case with multiple flavors and was not disappointed with any of them consider this product for your alternative to the high fat chips available everywhere i am sure these will catch on and become a big hit . 
saw these in whole foods and thought they looked interesting did n't care for them instantly , but by the time the first bag as gone \( i have a husband and kids \) , i was hooked wanted to try other flavors and this is a great way to do it personally , i like the plain and also the salt pepper my kids love all of them though and , while these are n't fruit veggies , i feel better about giving these to them as opposed to standard chips . 
we received our assorted single serve packs today this is the first time we ordered popchips they taste so good we are already down by 5 packets between adults and kids br please bear in mind that these chips will in no way compete with regular fried potato chips the low calories per bag is very much a part of why they deserve 5 stars i'm sure we will be ordering more yay to finding a new healthier snack alternative . 
i wa hesitant about ordering this product simply because i never ordered snacks of the internet , so after finally decided to order it it arrived within 3 days ! the flavor is awesome ! just like what i hoped for ! if you like health food or like potato chips but hate thinking about how oily they are after eating them then this product is for you ! if you are happy with the regular potato chips and does n't care about the the oil and calories then stay where you are ! those chips have so much flavor ! they kinda remind me of rice crackers but with flavor ! i have lived in the u k for a while and one thing i have always missed is the crisps that i used to eat in u k those popchips reminded me of the taste of the crisps ! i will be order those again ! . 
i am a huge fan of pop chips they had them at my grocery store , but their supply was dwindling , so i was afraid they were n't planning to order more i purchased two cases \( 48 individual bags \) of pop chips they are all excellent purchasing them in the variety pack gave me access to flavors they did n't have at the grocery store \( salt and vinegar , cheddar , salt and pepper \) i 've enjoyed all the flavors ! \( barbecue is still my favorite , though \) i also got a better deal buying them online . 
i have this on a monthly reoccurring purchase making the per unit price even lower that list that being said , pop chips are very tasty and the variety pack comes with 6 different flavors br br my favorite flavors are salt vinegar by far br br the calorie count makes this snack a very guilt free affair ! . 
i bought the 6 flavor variety pack they are pretty good nice thing is that i'm not 100 sure if i'm crazy about the texture so by the end of an 0 8 oz bag i do n't really want anymore however in my quest for different snack foods i found the food should taste good line of cracker chips my money will be spent on those rather than pop chips however i think that people should give these a try as well . 
the bbq chips are great we liked them better than regular chips they have a nice crunch hate kettle chips which are so hard that they are like eating shards of glass br br we will definitely be buying more of the popchips . 
these really are good i gave some to other people and they liked them too the plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa when eating the bbq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when i would eat bbq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range i think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at 100 cal per pack . 
to those of you , and there 's a lot of us , who are constantly watching our weight and calorie intake , these chips are a 1 in my book br br first of all , the flavors are incredible , very tastey and enjoyable the single serve bags are just the right amount , and a very nice portion might i add , and the calorie intake is only 100 calories for the entire single serve bag br br i'm so happy i tried them , i bought the variety pack of single serves and i ca n't say enough good things about them br br they 're crispy and crunchy and the flavors are n't to salty , just right br br so to those of you who enjoy a nice crunchy savory snack , you ca n't go wrong with popchips ! ! ! i'm hooked , now i just have to make sure i limit myself to only 1 2 bags a day ! ! ! br br they really are good and the nutritional information is n't bad at all br br so woo hoo for those of us who ca n't sit down with a big old bag of herrs or utz and just ca n't seem to stop ourselves from putting our hand back into the bag over and over and over again , do n't get me wrong i'm not bashing on herr 's or utz , i love them both , however they 're much higher in calorie than the popchips br br do yourselves a favor and give them a try , you truely ca n't go wrong , even my friends family , who do n't have to watch their calorie intake , enjoy them as well , so that 's saying something br br hope to read other reviews of happy calorie counting snackers ! ! ! ! ! br br keep on munching , the healthy way with popchips snacks . 
found these while looking for good , cheap , low calorie snack packs to buy in bulk for my office after my first shipment , i decided to have two boxes shipped to the office monthly via subscribe save my next shipment arrives in two days i'm so excited ! br br gotta have my pop chips . 
my husband and i both really like the popchips they are a great substitute for regular potato chips and we both find them very satisfying . 
i read a reference to these on jillian michaels 's website , checked out the popchips web page , and liked everything i read but the proof is in the tasting , of course they arrived today and the consensus here in this house is that popchips are incredible they taste sinfully good , crunchy and just yummy i love sea salt and vinegar chips in general , and truly loved the popchips version anyone on weight watchers plus will be happy to know that a single serving bag is only 3 measly points highly recommend it ! ! . 
what a great way to help with dieting and keeping on track these are very tasty and crunchy great with sandwiches or salad or even by themselves . 
my whole family loves these chips i am following the weight watchers plan and the whole bag is only 3 points , there is quite a few in the bag totally worth it ! ! ! . 
i am trying to eat healthy and could not really find any good tasting low fat snacks my friend told me about pop chips that she bought from amazon she said she loved them and i should give them a try , i said what the heck if she likes them they must be good and what do you know i loved them and i have a bag almost everyday for a snack . 
the only complaint i have with pop chips is that i ca n't get all of the flavors at the stores where i live ! ! ! my husband and i both love pop chips , his favorite is the salt and pepper and mine is the sour cream and onion pop chips are a perfect mix between a chip and a rice cake ! ! ! ! we cannot say enough good things about them ! . 
i love popchips they have a great crunch without the greasy feel and taste they are very similar to munchos very light and fluffy if you are looking for something to satisfy your salty craving , these are a great way without having to feel so guilty about consuming an enormous amount of calories . 
the original flavor would work fine with any dip and are okay on their own br the salt and pepper flavor is awesome really tasty and a great snack for only 100 calories br the sour cream and onion is a little chemicall y but decent br the barbeque is good but not tasty enough the flavor does n't go as well with the texture br br have n't yet tried the other two flavors will update as i do br br if you have n't tried popchips they are sort of a cross between pringles and rice cakes less like styrofoam than rice cakes and made with the same potato flakes kind of texture as pringles without as much fat br br so far i have this on subscribe and save and will keep that subscription active these definitely beat a 150 300 calorie bag of potato chips as a snack . 
i bought these when they were on a gold box deal thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches and then i 'd never buy them again br br not so br br they 're actually really tasty ! exceptionally crunchy ! and the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips definitely going on subscribe and save for a while br br i do n't think they 're any more salty than standard potato chips but they 're by no means low salt . 
popchips are a great guilt free way to add some crunchy satisfaction to your diet without added excess fat and sugar they are clean , light , deliciously satisfying and are available in a variety of flavors they would make a great lunch box addition popchips will be on hand in our home from now on ! . 
i received my box of assorted popchips a few days ago to support my weight watcher meal plan i absolutely love them and find that they fit in with my plan without hesitation i recommend all varieties of these chips what a great idea ! ! ! . 
what a great snack ! i love these crispy , crunchy , treats packaged in a single serve bag , i buy these by the pack of 24 assorted flavors so i have them on hand whenever i feel the urge to snack br unfortunately my family has discovered how good they are so they are now going faster than i had anticipated time to order some more ! all the different flavors are seasoned just right not too salty or spicy i love popchips ! . 
these chips are awesome the light airy texture makes them a pleasant snack i am dieting and thesse fit in reall nice gives me that salty , crunchy yummy taste that keeps my points low for the day i love them i have recommended them to all my diet buddies and they love them i have n't tried all the flavors yet , only those in the variety pack but trust me i will be tracking them all down and hopefully find my favorite that may be difficult they are all so good ! ! ! . 
i tried these in colorado and came home to find out they only sell them on the west coast amazon did n't sell the ones i wanted i put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one within a week of their birthday , amazon e mailed me that it was available great chips but , took longer to ship then expected just in the nick of time for the birthday when you want something real bad , amazon usually comes through . 
we absolutely loved the chips and after ordering them from amazon we were able to find them in target they have a really good flavor and we would eat them even if we were n't trying to loose weight recommended by weight watchers . 
popchips are absolutely delicious , and getting the variety pack is great everyone in my family has a favorite flavor highly recommend these as they feed your chip craving , but are not nearly as bad for you as chips . 
i really like the flavors and the fact that the chips are low in fat i especially like the bbq and salt and vinegar i do n't care for the salt and pepper i wish i could get a multipack and choose the flavors i want . 
we have played this with three adults fun game that does not take too long to play makes you think and plan only to have someone else mess up your plans . 
that 's all i can say yum at a great price ! i ca n't find these sizes anywhere in my local grocery so this is just awesome . 
great low cal snack satisfies the crunchy , snacky , salty cravings without high calories all flavors are good the cheddar is a little too seasoned for my taste . 
i have a free sampling of these chips and i can see me swapping them for my regular chip cravings they remind me of munchos , but are less greasy try them . 
if you have n't discovered pop chips yet you do n't know what you are missing low calorie and high in flavor great for the kids lunches i need the single servings or i will eat the whole big bag . 
i am so happy to try and enjoy pop chips they were recommended on calorie count com , products like this are not available at local grocers caloriecount com mentioned the snacks were available from amazon com which we all know is easy to order and accept delivery to your door the pop chips are delicious , they come in many flavors i have ordered them twice and shared them with friends we love the single serving 100 calorie packs the treats are tasty and delicious i am on an email list to alert me when the jalepemo flavored pop chips become available thanks amazon ! i am planning to order them again for snacks on a family vacation the variety will make this a fun treat and when compared to other 100 calorie treats this product gets a 10 10 rating from our family . 
these have become a wonderful alternative to those afternoon cravings for salt , and or sugar they have texture and flavor , and a bag hits the spot i would highly recommend these if you are looking for an alternative to the junk from candy machines . 
i love popchips ! ! these are the best individual serving bags , flavors are great , taste is excellent my daughter and grandson love the barbeque i have found that buying them through amazon is cheaper and amazon offers the bigger bags also i have to watch that because i could eat the whole bag . 
i am a chip fanatic , when i heard of these , i had to give them a try ! they are very tasteful esp the bbq one 's i have yet to try the other flavors but i am sure they will not disappoint i watch my weight health so these are perfect , just becareful because they are addicting ! . 
good variety of the flavors , makes it helpful to sample for your choice of type you prefer also good for packed lunches or as a portioned snack . 
this is a great snack to have instead of potato chips lower in calories but still delicious will be ordering them again . 
i was very pleased with the popchips my first order was before the chips hit the stores the taste is delightful no greasy taste in fact the variety in flavors will keep your palate very excited ! amazing how it is made calorie count is great too ! i went further to send the chips to my family they too were very pleased with them my third order i placed for a gathering of 12 friends they too , could not get over the variety of flavors and how they were made i feel the product itself won over more prospective customers try it yourself , i know you will be very pleased br br trish kowalski . 
i love popchips they are delicious and i ca n't believe one bag is only 100 calories the flavors are great although i am not a fan of salt and pepper i would highy recommend as a way to try the different flavors i am sure you will love them too . 
i hate healthy anything ! br br but i am overweight , so i need an alternative to my normal routine of doritos potato chips the only reason i tried these chips is because of the other reviews , so i am contributing my 5 stars toward the product br br from just looking at it , i was expecting it to taste more like rice cake but i was pleasantly surprise the chips tastes great , very crisp i do n't really know how to explain it br br all the flavors are great my favorite is the bbq the original is a bit too salty , but still very tasty br br highly recommended ! at least give it a try before disregarding it for being a healthier snack . 
i'm trying to eat healthier and one of the things i really love is chips and salty snacks of all kinds ! these popchips really do the trick of satisfying my craving though i do n't really care for the pepper flavor , i like all of the others i will buy these again . 
i found these chips on vacation in oregon the store was a kind of natural yet upscale type of grocery store i had never seen them before they are different than regular chips no oily taste but very flavorful i did n't know if i could get them in ca so i ordered a case ! . 
these taste great and are a healthier alternative my favorite was the sea salt and vinegar i probably wo n't order the other flavors again since i have a favorite , and do n't eat potato chips all that often but the variety pack was great to get to try them all . 
these are great my entire family loves them it is a great addition to my son 's school lunch and i have the satisfaction of knowing it is a better alternative then the normal chip out on the market great flavor bbq and sourcream onion are our favorites ! love the single serve bags wish you could buy them at the store but for now i will continue to purchase on amazon because of the great service and varieties ! . 
these chips are flavorful without all the fat of fried i love love the bbq flavor i also like how the chips do n't crumble in the bag . 
these are great little snack packs flavorful chips and fairly low fat and low cal . 
i tried this chips in a hotel that i stayed at , and loved them ! i ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them i'm on my second order ! . 
popchips are very good the varity received lets you try the diferent flavors i only wish i could find them locally . 
these are the best chips invented for those who are trying to watch their calorie intake you get a lot of chips for minimal calories , and they taste great ! ! . 
great selection of chips very fresh if you are are looking for a healthy alternative to fried potato chips do n't like the fake taste of baked , these are just the most amazing chips you can eat i bought 2 cases every time i'm at target or our super box store i make sure to pick them up ! ! . 
i agree with reviewers who enjoy this alternative to the regular salty snack options the texture of the chips is great and they 're very flavorful ! i can certainly taste the sodium but if this is n't a problem for you , i would recommend trying them it 's a snack i look forward to having a chance to enjoy everyone has their favorite flavor \( i'm no exception bbq ftw ! \) so i recommend trying the variety pack first i thought i 'd have at least one or two flavors we 'd 'hate' , but no br br my initial purchase of an alternative snack was stacy 's pita chips in parmesan garlic herb nothing against them , but they lacked the flavor punch i was looking for these popchips are exactly right br br i can definitely recommend these chips for anyone who likes a salty , flavorful snack ! . 
i loved these chips they were exactly what i had been looking for they are not fried greasy or baked dry they were great tasting , satisfying , and healthy alternative to regular potato chips you can feel good about eating these chips ca n't say enough , you 'll have to try them for yourself ! i am ordering more now ! . 
although i can not say that these are the same thing as potato chips , they are a good alternative and very tasty the flavors are much like the potato chips you would get at the store it is the texture that is different they are less oil \( a good thing \) and lighter than potato chips almost like a rice cake except much thinner and crisper all of the flavors are good except for the cheese one i did n't care for it although my two year old likes it br br all in all , for the calories , you ca n't beat it , and for long term weight maintenance and health , these are great and delicious as well amazon com sends out a very fresh product that is as good as if you bought it from the shelf of your local grocery store . 
the chips are very good and serve as a great snack with very low calories and weight watcher point value . 
i was on the fence about buying these for months i read the reviews and were impressed by them but , the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips i hated made me nervous this was my first food order from amazon and i am glad i picked this product to be i absolutely love these chips i deiced on the variety pack to start with in case i did n't like one flavor had others i could eat turns out though i enjoy them all br br they are thicker than your normal potato chip with a great crunch and more of an airy texture one bag fills me up as a mid day snack the flavors themselves are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip for me this was a good thing i would have to say the bbq is my favorite the flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it , the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end my bags had very few broken chips in them everything about this order was great br br my father was around when i was trying my first bag , making fun of them cause they were healthy i offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect he looked at me confused once he ate it , promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it this is a man who hates anything healthy , but shows how good the flavors are br br i will definitely be buying these again . 
i picked up a 3 oz bag of the salt and vinegar chips last weekend at wegman 's and in a blink of an eye , the bag was gone very nice vinegar flavor bad side was in a blink of an eye they were gone which is not good for portion control i ordered the variety pack in 8 oz size \( single serving \) to help with portion control most of the flavors i like but fair warning , the parmesan garlic is very garlic love the salt and pepper with 100 calories a pack , what a nice change from baked chips try it you will like it . 
popchips are really , really good ! do n't expect a regular old , greasy potato chip , but do expect something equally awesome that stands on its own popchips do n't leave any funny residue in your mouth like some other diet chips , and they do n't have a lot of fat and calories only 100 cal per single serve bag ! i got the variety pack , and liked every one of the six flavors some better than others \( because i'm not a big fan of cheddar chips by any maker , so these were as good as any \) , but all were good , most were great even non dieters who tried them liked them it seems like they cost a bit more than the average bag of chips , but maybe that 's because i had to buy a case even so , they 're worth it if you 're fighting the battle of the bulge and want a lo cal indulgence you would n't otherwise be able to enjoy my recommendation eat popchips ! . 
here 's the straight talk from a foodie , not a top chef food critic , but a foodie br name pop chips they are cooked in a kettle with pressure and heat fantastic not baked or fried made by the company pop chips so it is n't frito lays or mars trying to forcefeed america in disguise br packaging and branding colorful and way too heavy duty bags this is why they are slightly expensive similar to kettle chips packaging you will have fun opening the bags with a pop packaging was great i 've eaten about 6 of the small bags and not one was even slightly damaged br taste and texture they are about the size of half dollar coins , kind of puffy like a pork rind or rice cake , and they are not crunchy hard like potato chips but they do crunch definitely distinctive and they deserve a place on the market br nutrition 100 calories ! unfortunately , you know what this means it 's not a big grab by any means it 's about 15 20 chips per 8 oz bag which , honestly , is great for portion control it 's probably all we need and popchips knows it definitely more filling than other 100 calorie snacks made by , say , snackwell or the oreos mini muffins type br flavor the 3 pack comes with cheddar potato , sea salt and vinegar , and barbecue potato as an english major i'm inclined to take the potato off the label just as salty and flavorful as normal chips , but not overpowering like some \( cheap tortilla chips some doritos \) natural taste br i bought these on sale with a 15 20 discount i believe i might purchase them again if i won a gift card or something , but i would rather look for these in a store or at a warehouse club and save some cash trees on the gigantic box they come in but if you are on the fence and worried about being disappointed , you wo n't be this is definitely quality over quantity . 
i ordered these chips due to other readers reviews being so good in addition , my pregnant wife and i enjoy foods that are portioned and easy for taking on the go but the main reason i ordered these chips was that they are a health conscious choice and the flavor does not disappoint ! they are excellent br br here is a nutritional breakdown br br calories 100 br calories from fat 30 br total fat 3g br saturated fat , trans fat , poly and mono 0g br cholesterol 0mg br sodium 160mg 7 br potassium 180mg 5 br total carbohydrates 15g 5 br dietary fiber 1g 4 br sugars 2g 4 br protein 1g br calcium 2 br iron 2 .

we tried these chips because dr oz had recommended them on his show as a healthier potato chip alternative my whole family loves them , we have not found a flavor that we do n't like these are way better than any baked style chip try them and you wo n't be disappointed ! . 
these chips are pretty delicious even the original flavor with nothing on it is good it 's not as delicious as doritos , but it 's also not fried either , which definitely balances it out a good snack for all times of day ! . 
my kids loved these and they were such a great deal i did n't feel so guilty about giving my kids chips ! ! . 
like many others , we were on the fence about buying these popchips , with the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips that even the dogs may not eat turns out though we enjoy them all , the kids like the plain ones , saying they taste like pringles , and my wife and i are particularly fond of the cracked pepper and salt we are not fans of bbq chips in general , but still ate the bbq popchips br br i will definitely be buying these again . 
everyone should try these chips they are healthier than regular chips and they taste good . 
this was our first time trying popchips , but i had heard so many good things about them so i was eager to try them we ordered the variety pack to try a few flavors my kids gobbled all of them easily but their favorite was the salt and vinegar my favorite by far is the bbq flavor we love popchips here ! ! ! . 
these are the best alternative chips i have ever tried i have shared them with friends and relatives and they all agree you get enough in the single serve packs to be truly satisfied and if you are a weight watchers customer , they are great , only 2 points for each bag ! ! ! . 
possibly the best salt and vinegar chips \( healthy or not \) ever ! the salt is just right and compliment the vinegar 's tartness perfectly br br all the chips are good salt and pepper can be a little overwhelming . 
these are by far one of the most tasty chips available in the market it 's not greasy , does n't leave a strong after taste as compared to other chips available in the market first time time tasting it was during the natural product expo west 2009 in anaheim , fell in love with it almost right away br br the only thing i can complain about this product was probably the price , which is higher compared to chips of other brands in addition , the barbeque flavor and the original flavor are slightly salty compare to the rest of the flavor in the variety pack br br amazon 's pricce on this item , along with the subscription discount made me pull the trigger almost instantaneously if you have a costco nearby , you can also purchase this item at a very discounted price , slightly higher than what amazon offers though . 
this variety pack is perfect for when you want something crunchy and salty br the selection of flavors were great choices for me i liked them all br the portion keeps you from overeating , and they are healthier for you than br potato chips , even the baked ones br i recommend these and will be buying them again and again . 
the popchips are a nice alternative to potato chips they are not greasy and only 100 calories per bag great for dieters fits in with a low calorie diet definitely would recommend trying at least once . 
totally amazing and very delicious br br my favorite flavors \( from best to worst \) br br 1 barbecue br 2 sour cream and onion br 3 cheddar br br 4 salt and pepper br 5 original br 6 vinegar and sea salt . 
salt and vinegar and bbq rock ! plain were ok did n't really care for cheddar nice to start w a variety pack to find the ones you prefer . 
if you had to choose , my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar , followed by salt and pepper suprisingly , the original flavor was my least favorite , probably because i was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer very tasty chips , healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor in fact , the taste is better than most regular chips i 've had would highly recommend this product ! this is a really nice product . 
i got these for 10 for the 24 pack , so a pretty good deal they are about as healthy as the baked chips i usually buy they all taste great and im officially a fan br br it 's pretty much what it sounds like chips that are popped instead of baked so they do have some air in them 8 ounce bags is slightly more than the 75 ounches in baked lays bags i was buying br br good buy if you can get a good deal like i did . 
popchips are a healthy and light alternative to regular potato chips they are full of flavor , and only 2 weight watcher points per delicious bag ! i have shared these chips with family and friends , and they are all now fans ! a href http www amazon com gp product b001rvfdoo popchips 6 flavor variety pack , 0 8 ounce single serve bags \( pack of 24 \) a .

excellent taste for a low calorie snack this size bag is exactly 100 calories and you get a lot of chips i prefer these to the regular greasy chips . 
i expected idk maybe tasteless cardboard but these are really good i have only tried the bbq so far but it packs a lot of flavor and you get a lot of chips in a single serving bag ! i will update after my family beach trip because i am taking the 24 pack with us for some moderately healthy snacking my only caveat is these could prove to be addictive i am looking to watch my weight and these are definitely a temptation ! very happy with this product \) . 
i love popchips and this was really a treat to get the variety of flavors and the individual bags were such convenience ! thank you ! . 
i absolutely love pop chips as a healthy alternative to regular , fatty chips the seat salt and pepper and the sour cream and onion are my favorites i do n't crave regular chips at all ! . 
i luv me some popchips ! ! these are great snack items i ordered a case , and passed them around my office now everyone is addicted to these chips i have not found anyone that did not like these chips and they are healthier than the baked chips out there yumm ! ! . 
popchips do n't taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options they are light in taste and big on crunch great alternative to potato chips i'm not a fan of the bbq flavor but i do like the sea salt vinegar , salt pepper alot and sour cream and onion like the individual bags perfect for on the go and lunches . 
when i found these chips i was shocked to see how little fat there is in these they taste great and the are actually not bad for you either i told my sister , and she has told her friend everyone loves them after they try them we order boxes so we can have them at work instead of using the vending machines , the office loves them they can be a little hard to find , that why i order the online . 
this 24 pack lasted about a month , and i sampled all of the flavors but only got to eat the barbecue flavor once , as it is my wife 's and my favorite so , i reordered just the barbecue great snack for 100 calories i 've purchased the reduced fat pringles 100 calorie individual packs before , and you get a lot more chips in a popchips bag than from pringles . 
great product ! all the flavors were delicious loved the fact that the single serve bags were about 100 calories each . 
i love these chips , i have them on auto order every 2 months , they taste great , i can not belive the whole bag has 100 calories , i have a bag every day , it sure has helped my weight loss by haveing them in little bags , so i do not eat a huge amount . 
i am very impressed with the flavors all of them ! there were a few flavors i was n't sure i was going to like but they are really good also ! the flavors are very intense you are not getting a bland chip i'm on the monthly plan but i 've already had to order them ahead of schedule twice ! . 
popchips are delicious and much healthier than your regular potato chips i love all the flavors ! ! it 's also nice to get a variety box with single serving bags .

i love pop chips and the variety pack was fantastic delivered quickly these chips are filling , full of flavor and way healthier than other types of chips . 
i first tried them after a product get together at jelly belly in fairfield , ca i was so pleased , that i wanted more ! well my husband said he saw some at costco so he got a few flavors and boy was i hooked i sent my grandsons in idaho a box of 24 mixed small packages and also a friend in ohio the same thing i am on a calorie counting diet along with my husband and we eat the popchips almost every day i like the different flavors and the fact they are healthy for you alot better then baked or fried i am sold and really enjoy them you came up with a fantastic product sincerely , viki crabtree . 
pop chips are very good ! i'm on a mission to lose weight and these have replaced high calorie snacks i think i even like these better than regular chips ! the bbq , salt vinegar , and cheddar are really good alone \( and i'm not normally a bbq chip person \) i tend to eat the original , sour cream onion , and the salt pepper with laughing cow cheese as a dip i do n't really care for the salt pepper as much as the others because i do n't really like pepper in general and these are very peppery i wish they would replace the salt pepper with the parmesan garlic flavor br br also , i like to buy these small packages to limit my portion size , but also because there are a lot of chips in this one little bag it also makes it really convenient for me to grab a few bags and take them to work or throw a few in the car i do n't have kids but the small bags would be nice for kids as well . 
my son and daughter in law told me about these chips and they purchased a few bags at a store and i will say they are higher in stores then you can get them online on amazon they brought me a bag and i was hooked ! so i ordered popchips online and they are the best chips ! ! there was n't a flavor i did n't like or that my family did n't like i am a \( chipaholic \) and these are better for you and a great tasting chip i highly recommend these to anyone that ca n't do without eating chips either with a sandwich , hamburger , or just to munch on midday br you wo n't be dissapointed . 
the pop chips are great i had heard they were really good and i totally agree i love being able to have all the flavors i like the variety br the chips were delivered quickly and safely . 
i love popchips and especially when they are in individual portion sizes and a variety of flavors good for you and tastes great and are easy to put in lunches or snacks on the go ! . 
if i had to describe a popchip , i would say that it 's a hybrid of a potato chip and a popcorn cake i was a little skeptical , at first , since i was trying to figure out how they were made if they were n't baked or fried , but i was pleasantly surprised when i tried them this variety pack gives people a good opportunity to try the six different flavors and decide which ones are their favorite \( s \) if you 're a snacker or if you are looking for a healthier alternative to fried potato chips , this are a must try . 
i liked most all of these except for the cheddar ones these are packed with flavor and are a great alternative to regular potato chips as well as being just 80 just as good br br the best way to describe these is that they are like rice cakes except make from potatoes i hate rice hates but loved these \( just the texture is compared to rice cakes not the flavor \) and i will definitely purchase them again in the future br br i recommend giving these a chance , they are a great healthy and quick snack . 
for 100 calories a bag , these are the closest thing you will get to regular potato chips , they have great crunch and flavor . 
these are crunchy and very tasty ! these do n't taste like the 'usual' chips from the store when i first tried them , i could tell right away they were different from the greasy , salty , fatty chips i was used to eating these have their own flavor and crunch and i started to appreciate them right away i noticed i did n't feel so sluggish and icky after eating these which was wonderful the combo package is great because the flavors are all very different and tasty and i love the smaller packages they really hit the spot without the risk of overindulging . 
the pop chips are really incredible they are very flavorful and crispy my favorite is the bbq , but that is just me , they are all good i would highly recommend these to anyone who is watching their weight of just for overall better health . 
these chips tatse great , and the serving size is good we especially liked the variety pack with six flavors . 
i recently received the variety packs of popchips i have them delivered to work and everyone just loves them br br i tried one flavor delicious , next flavor excellent , next flavor oh my goodness , even better and it gets better and better br br best snack in recent memory \) . 
very tasty chips , healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor in fact , the taste is better than most regular chips i 've had would highly recommend this product ! if you had to choose , my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar , followed by salt and pepper ironically , the original flavor was my least favorite , probably because i was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer . 
these chips might seem a little expensive compared to other leading \( and unhealthy i might add \) chips , but i was not disappointed in my purchase they arrived in a few days and made the perfect snack for me and my husband 's lunches also , we checked for the closest store selling these and it was target 50 miles away in tulsa and would have been costly to buy them as they are more per case and the drive to get them . 
the reason why i ordered this on line is because the only pop chips they have in my store are the regular and salt and vinegar barbeque i love the sour cream and onion ones actually i love all of them , but it 's great to have them in the 100 calorie bag , because if they were n't i would n't be able to stop eating them . 
i love these chips and my husband does too he wipes them out before i can get to them the variety pack is a great way to determine which flavor you like they are packaged well and always fresh the bag contains a generous portion i 've purchased many times and am never dissapointed . 
this is a great chip replacement ! wow all the flavors are terrific , good with a sandwich , soup , or just a late night snack ! . 
pop chips are the best chips i 've had in a long time i'm a weight watcher and to satisfy that salty craving i get now and then these chips are the ticket and they are only 2 points and when i buy a case of them they average i think about 94 not bad . 
loved the assortment pack everyone in family loves them low fat , lower calorie and all natural , simple snack for kid 's lunch bags it is peanut and tree nut free \( safe for allergy kids \) and although it is made on equipment shared with wheat , i bought this for my child who is on an wheat limiting diet . 
i am a chip addict and these are by far some of the tastiest , non homemade chips i 've ever had plus they 're healthy ! only problem is i ca n't decide which flavor is my favorite . 
i love these chips they are excellent ! on the weight watchers plan they are only 2 points per bag which is great for potatoe chips love the single serving bags for portion control also love amazon com for selling them ca n't find them in the stores i will be ordering these forever great product a href http www amazon com gp product b001rvfdoo popchips 6 flavor variety pack of 24 amazon frustration free packaging a . 
i love these chips and they are a perfect low fat snack to keep me held over through my day the only thing bad about the amazon price is they are about 20 for a 24 pack that is 80 cents each sadly i discovered this great snack at work in the vending machine for 75 cents i would expect to buy them for 50 a pack if i have to buy 24 and not from a vending machine i highly recommend these chips , but there is no savings buying the from amazon . 
variety pack of popchips r sooo good all flavors r delicious and r way healthier than regular greasy potato chips popchips r half the fat and only 100 calories so a def must buy . 
i am in love with pop chips ! they are my go to low calorie snack ! the largest 100 calorie pack out there ! . 
these chips are very good wish we could purchase them in our area great chance to try them in this offer . 
these are better than any low calorie chips i 've ever had , and i prefer them to normal chips they are wonderful oprah even loves them i would buy this box again , and probably will , because i love that these are 100 calorie packs the barbeque and salt and vinegar ones are awesome . 
they were not bad tasting they served the purpose that i wantned with a sandwich nice and crunchy . 
these chips are delicious and each bag only has 100 calories they are not fried but just baked and come in 6 different flavors for anyone who is dieting but loves potato chips these are great . 
these are the best chips ever and what a great swap for all the fat and calories of regular chips not to mention that they come in single servings so when you eat the whole bag it 's ok ! ! ! great product and i would highly recommend it anyone . 
i originally found these at a target out of my home town i fell in love with them as part of my weight watcher 's plan they are a good snack alternative when i crave something salty i could not find them where i live so i purchased them from the pop chips web site which took me through amazon yummy ! . 
this is one of the best new products i have ever tried in a long time these are delicious chips , they taste like chips , \( not styrofoam \) and are all natural ! br the barbeque are outstanding , as are the plain , sour creme and onion , salt and pepper i do n't love the cheddar or the salt and vinegar , they are a bit strong br br if you are on weight watchers each bag is 2 points , and are a great find to cover the crunchy salty crave , if you are not on weight watchers , you will still enjoy them my husband loves them , my co workers love them , kids love them they can not believe their mom is allowing them to eat a bag of chips a day ! br br overall an excellent product ! . 
these taste wonderful ! guilt free if you can stop at one bag will definitly buy again ! . 
love , love , love these crunchy little treats they remind me of munchos but without the greasy tounge afterwards i do n't usually like flavored snacks , but these are all great , not overwhelming and no gross aftertaste i subscribe to them so i will never run out \) . 
what 's to say pop chips are great ! ! ! kudos to the pop chip makers . 
i really liked these chips br br they came recommended from my friend and i really like them the variety pack is great to try all of the flavors although there were some i was n't so fond of br br the cheddar , bbq , and salt pepper chips are great the traditional ones are get this traditional no excitement there br br the chips are great my brother still asks if i have any around the house but i have n't yet purchased them again br br hint the have the texture of the snack munchos . 
i love these chips so much and i ca n't get over how delicious each variety is ! ! the price here is awesome too ! . 
i picked up a few bags of these at my local heb and couldnt help but consume half of a bag in a day the entire stock didnt last even a week for me br br many chips say they have a bold flavor but they never deliver these , however , do i tried the garlic parmessan chips and the first things i thought was how strong and delicious the parmessan was shortly followed by a garlic flavor combined with a sharp crunch , i cannot have enough of these chips i'm almost afraid to buy a 24 pack because i know they wo n't last a month br br it also helps that these things are pretty healthy for you i mean , they are a potato crisp so you ca n't be entirely guilt free but i do n't knock myself for going to town i just avoid the potato chip aisle these are on when i need to lay low on the snack foods \) . 
these chips are incredible ! enough ca n't be said about them they are better than potato chips and without the guilt of fat and calories ! . 
i love these chips ! they always make a great healthy snack when i'm stuck at work with just the vending machine for sustenance . 
love these pop chips ! the variety bag was a great deal , especially with the 5 off tasty , low fat just what i needed as a healthy alternative for a great price i highly recommend these ! . 
i love popchips ! ! they taste great and they do not have all of the fat that regular chips contain i was introduced to the wonderful world of popchips several months ago and i have not looked at regular chips the same i do not consume copious amounts of potato chips , however , i do occasionally pack my kids lunch with the salty tubers my family enjoys the popchips so much , that i purchased a variety pack of 24 \( 0 8oz bags \) from amazon they taste very good and the texture is wonderful , although i will admit they are a bit salty i really enjoy the salt and pepper flavor the best , with the salt and vinegar coming in a close second make sure you have a large glass of water as you are consuming these popped treats , because as i stated before they are quite salty i highly recommend these for individuals who eat potato chips and want a somewhat more healthy alternative . 
love all the flavors ! ! ! ! ! just the right size package and taste great ! ! ! ! ! give them a try you will love them also ! ! ! ! ! . 
i discovered pop chips a year or so ago , and my whole family loves them ! we are partial to crunchy , salty snacks \( like potato chips \) but hardly ever get them because of the calorie overload these are a perfect substitute ! great to tide you over between meals , or with a sandwich , or a movie watching snack the small size bags are perfect for not getting too carried away , too ! . 
i love popchips , the bag now has only 100 calories and it bit smaller but if you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great these are for you a bit pricey but worth it . 
i heard of these through my weight watchers magazine they a had a 5 coupon code so i figured what the heck ! wow pop chips are amazing every flavor is awesome ! i particularly liked the salt pepper if you want crunch and flavor these are for you ! ! . 
i shared these with my two older sons , then ordered more these are great to put in the glove compartment for after work . 
in my book you can eat one serving with ease and not feel any remorse just wish that there were more bbq and cheese flavored selections the black pepper is the bestest yet . 
they taste awesome ! esp the salt n pepper one ! i love them and they are really healthy ! the packaging is really good . 
these popchips are a great alternative when you need a munchie , crunchie snack they are much lower in calories fat than regular chips and are portioned controlled i especially like the barbeque flavor or the salt and pepper flavored popchips . 
we love popchips , but they 're hard to find at our local grocery stores i was very excited to find this variety pack , which has 6 flavors \( some of which we 'd never tried before \) in single serve packages right around 100 calories a piece our favorites were the original , sea salt vinegar , and sour cream onion but all of the flavors were good these were perfect for snacks , but they also made for easy lunches we 'll definitely order again ! . 
popchips are an excellent snack i really like all of the varieties i use amazon 's subscription plan and save some i get 1 24 pack box per month , shipped automatically life is grand ! . 
popchips are phenomenal ! unfortunately , just not readily available at a retailer near you ordering online is the next best , especially with amazon prime service ! my dad loved his boxes of popchips i'm happy , as his daughter , to find a healthier snack that he can enjoy and receive right at his doorstep . 
i am enjoying the recent purchase of popchips , so far i have enjoyed all the flavor choices the individual serving bags make it easy for me to have just the right portion serving with my meals or if i have a craving for a snack thanks for the product jean roth . 
i'm really glad amazon carries these , they are so much better for you than regular chips and actually taste good too we have n't found a flavor we did n't like yet i 'll probably use the amazon subscribe feature to get another 3 off as we will go through these fairly regularly awesome chips ! . 
these are the best chips i have every tasted they are healthy for4 you have great flavor i will buy often i eat 1 bag a day with my lunch yummy ! ! ! . 
this chips are perfect for a snack without having greasy fingers leftover all the flavors are great with my favorite being the vinegar and sea salt . 
great chips no after taste br seem to be much better for me br need to buy the big bags now . 
amazing concept not fried , not even baked popped like popcorn ! ! ! ! br this is another product for my weight watchers regima each bag is only 2 points i love this snack for mid morning in between breakfast and lunch they taste really good my favorite are the bar b que , salt vinegar , and the sour cream they are all good though . 
i ordered these chips because they got so many good reviews and i'm so glad i did br all of the flavors are tasty and satisfying at 100 calories a bag , they are a great snack they quell that hunger for crunchy , salty , goodness without killing my diet yes , they are a bit pricier than a big bag of regular chips , but it stops me from eating just a couple more and 1 bag is really enough to keep me happy i 've got a new favorite chip . 
if you are trying to eat healthy \( like me \) , but love junk food \( like me \) , these are the chips for you i have given up potato chips and french fries in my quest to eat guilt free , but a sandwich just needs something on the side these chips add a great crunch as a side to a sandwich , and are a great snack for only 100 calories they have no preservatives , no artificial flavors or colors , no cholesterol , 0 grams saturated fat , o grams trans fat , and are gluten free ingredients are potato flakes , potato starch , safflower oil and or sunflower oil , rice flour , sea salt they would be great to pack in a school lunch or for an after school snack i ordered them on the subscription plan , a case a month , but might have to add an extra shipment everyone i have given a pack to loved them too and came back for more . 
i happened upon this item in my local deli and being curios i decided to try they were fabulous better than the regular chips by far i gives you satisfaction of crunch and flavor in a potatoe chip great great find . 
i first got the variety pack to try all the different flavors , then i picked 2 and ordered them on subscribe and save \( 1 each on alternate months \) it 's much cheaper than the vending machine at work and they only have chips that are bad for you these chips are crisp , delicious , and taste salty , mmmmmmm good ! each bag has 230 mg of sodium they only have 100 calories in a bag , and the amount of chips in the bag is ample for one serving , unlike other 100 calorie snacks where you get 7 almonds , or 5 crackers now i can have chips every day at work for lunch , no guilt ! the salt and pepper variety is absolutely delicious the plain is great for dipping , and the barbecue is full of flavor the salt and vinegar is very sour , if you like that type , and the cheddar and sour cream and onion varieties are good , just not my favorites a very good deal on subscribe and save , chips delivered to your door , individually bagged and ready to take for lunch convenient ! nothing bad to say about popchips ! . 
the chips are good with fast service but i ordered a case \( 24 \) of popchips 6 flavor variety pack and received 24 bags all barbecue flavored . 
i 've tried using a toaster microwave confection oven stove to make these things myself , but i was n't able to i even tried barbecuing but was unable to get the chips to pop i verified my methods with a local grocery store clerk named mat \( his name has one t , which seemed a little strange to me \) , but to no avail br br i contacted customer support asking for instructions but they acted aloof and confused about their own product ! i do n't know why they could n't just mail , or at least email me some popping instructions br br luckily i think even raw unpopped they taste pretty good people look at them funny at first , but after they try a few they basically devour the whole bag , completely unpopped . 
the 'sun chips' are an ok substitute for the usual potato , corn , whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted they are not nearly as un palatable as i thought they would be have added them to my 'heart healthy' diet regime all are good except for the 'multi grain' style , which has the texture of a sheet of plywood . 
the cheddar tastes a little weird , but that could be personal preference the salt and vinegar is very strong , but tastes okay other than that salt and pepper is yum ! barbeque is good too plain is plain if you 're a die hard potato chip lover and do n't care about calories , do n't bother with these however , if you want your salty snacks and do n't want all the calories , these work i 'd buy them again . 
i have been on weight watcher 's for about 13 months i have lost 60 pounds the most important part to being on weight watchers is too find food items that let you feel like your not giving anything up popchips do that for me they are only 2 points plus on weight watcher 's they go great with every meal \( salad , soup , sandwich , etc \) i can not live without them so i say buy buy buy and buy . 
love these ! i'm not a fan of potato chips but these taste fresh and not at all greasy a little like pringles but much tastier . 
i am so happy to have discovered these chips i hate stealing a phrase from another product , but they melt in your mouth i have ordered and tried all flavors without disappointment just getting ready to place another order for these 100 calorie per bag , air popped chips do try them people ! . 
love the chips , nice 100 calorie snack , reminds me of munchos , but less greasy , flavors are good \( salt vinegar least favorite \) and they 've started shipping apo thank you and my family thanks you \( so they do n't have to get the package and reship ! \) made my day . 
i wo n't get into all of the specifics of these chips as they are listed here on amazon however , i will talk about the product overall it is very well packaged , the popchips bags are n't flimsy or too loud you do n't have to worry much about these getting smashed while they 're in a bag with heavier items they hold their own when trying new foods , snacks , flavors , i tend to purchase a variety pack so that i can sample everything let me tell you , these chips are packed with flavor but , it 's not , in my opinion , too heavy or saturated my favorites are the barbecue potato and cheddar potato by far very realistic , savory flavors then , there a couple that are not my favorite but , tasty with time the sea salt and pepper potato and the sea salt and vinegar potato are a bit strong at first and , if you do n't like those flavors , i would say you would n't like those chips but , they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients original potato and sour cream and onion potato are also tasty but , nothing to necessarily rave about , for me at least i would not call this a diet chip but , a healthy alternative to over processed chips i saw a few complaints about the popchips being too salty or high in sodium the chips can come across salty to a person who does n't consume much salt but , per bag , these popchips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt overall , great buy you just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you , and for me , it is . 
wow , these are remarkably tasty chips i discovered them through weight watchers and like the fact that they are low in calories and fat br but they are high in flavor and umami br i am now a big fan ! . 
these are great because they 're only 100 calories per pack and are just as good , if not better , than other chips out there br br the original style taste exactly like munchos , but do n't come with the high calorie count the other flavors \( sour cream onion , salt vinegar , salt pepper , cheddar , and bbq \) are all delicious , as well . 
we liked these quite good , even if they 're 'healthy' 100 calories 3 whole fat grams a bag my favorites are the plain , the others are very strong flavored , very zippy ! . 
i had seen these advertised on the hungry girl website but was not big on buying an expensive potato chip i was given a free bag at some event found them to be tasty the single serve bags in the grocery store were 1 for a 0 8 oz bag buy them from here and they are 21 for 24 1 oz bags \( same amount of weight watchers points \) if you get two cases , shipping is free ! get them now before the states force the sales tax thing through ! br br all of the flavors are really good i even liked the bbq which i normally do not like in a chip the cheddar have a good cheese taste and the salt'n'pepper have a kick they do not leave a funny aftertaste or strange mouth coating like some of the other lower fat calorie chips . 
love these chips they are perfectly seasoned and of course have no grease at all there is also not the cardboard taste of a baked chipped the popped texture of the potatoes is nice and light they are only 100 calories a bag , but there are lots of chips in the bag so it 's a great snack the ingredient list is also pretty wholesome without any strange chemicals added fav flavor is probably salt and pepper or bbq . 
i love chips and can easily go through an entire bag in one sitting with popchips single serve pouches , i can now feel good about snacking as each bag is only 100 calories the single serve pouches also help in portion control the larger bags are a slightly better value , but unless you have astounding self control , i would recommend the single serving option they are that good ! they easily stand up to any of the traditional fried chips i 've ever had , and at half the fat and calories , how could you ask for anything more \? br br the variety pack comes in 6 flavors original , sour cream and onion , salt and pepper , cheddar , salt and vinegar , and bbq my favorite flavors are salt and pepper and cheddar my least favorite is salt and vinegar , but i do n't like any salt and vinegar flavored chip my only wish is that this variety pack contained the parmesan garlic flavor which is very good , but extremely hard to find in local stores i have ordered the parmesan garlic flavor in a 24 pack here on amazon , but prefer the assortment that comes in the variety pack br br at 17 after the subscribe and save discount , each bag costs only 70 cents this is a bargain for these great tasting , healthy chips and i highly recommend you try them ! . 
i was a little hesitant to try these , especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive however , i liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and i figured they would be great for school lunches , quick snacks , etc i decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them , they could be donated i ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more \( or less \) and thought that would give us a good sampling after deciding we liked most of the flavors , we decided to try other ones as well br br despite the flavor preferences , these chips do not taste like cardboard at first taste , they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect i think this is a good thing , because it means they are not heavily laden with oil the 0 8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well , which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories , trans fat , etc br br i have included a summary of opinions below from myself , friends and family for each flavor br br sea salt vinegar great , the absolute favorite flavor for everyone br bbq very good , i'm not crazy about bbq to begin with but would say this flavor is sweet bbq everyone else loved them br cheddar very good , probably close in preference to the bbq br original potato good , but a little salty \( seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags \) br salt pepper good , everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more br parmesan garlic good , but overall was 50 50 you definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter br sour cream onion not so good , no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag br br i know taste is a very subjective thing , but i hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try i did get them at a reduced price through subscribe save , and shortly after my first order , amazon had them on the gold box for an even better price i think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account . 
these are the greatest potato snack products i 've found only 2 points for weight watchers really crispy and tasty all of the flavors are great my only complaint it 's difficult to open the little bags i need a pair of scissors , but i guess that keeps them fresher for longer so it 's a great trade off i would recommend these chips to everyone . 
i really like these chips they have a different texture than regular potato chips but i still find it really tasty even my boyfriend , who is often averse to all things healthy and low fat will gobble these up rather quickly the variety packs are great because they allow you to have a little bit of everything , but of course the downside is that you may not like some flavors as much i find the original version to be a little bland by itself , and the sea salt and vinegar flavor might be too strong for some people . 
i am potato chip addicted i do n't only enjoy potato chips , but i also enjoy any type of potato product this product really hit the mark for me br br i consider these a full fledged snack each bag is packed with chips they are moderately seasoned , and full of flavor the consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake but they 're crisp and crunchy , not puffy they have a distinct potato taste br br the best part \? each bag clocks in at only 100 calories ! and i repeat these are not a simple 100 calorie snack what you get here is a full bag of chips what 's great about the content vs calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200 300 calorie bag of chips br br my personal favorites were the sea salt and vinegar and the original the barbecue flavor is sweet , not smoky the salt and pepper , cheddar , and sour cream and onion flavors are standard fair but the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and i did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next br br these are a great product , well manufactured , and a treat to eat i 'll definitely buy more of these in the future . 
wow , these chips are delicious ! br br they 're low in calorie and carb count i can actually have a salty snack without feeling guilty about it and the taste is better then unhealthy oil smothered grocery store chips br br the sour cream onion , salt vinegar , and cheddar are my favorites ! br br if you 're weight conscience , want something healthy , or just want something that tastes good , buy these chips ! you wo n't be disappointed ! . 
this does n't taste as addicting as the real fried potato chips , but it 's still very good br considering it 's low in calories and it 's only popped it taste much better than the ones that are freeze dried br these pops taste as light as the rice crispy treats , but with a good amount of flavor and crunch br i like it , a small little pack that you can just grab when you feel like having something quick br i keep then in my room in case if i ever get the cravings for chips br all the flavors that come in are good too , no complains br br the package also arrived fast and it 's pretty cheap , i would recommend people who is watching calories to get this ! . 
it felt weird ordering 24 bags of chips off the internet that i had never even tried before , but i am so glad i did they are delicious ! i 've tried 4 flavors so far have loved each one these are a win \) . 
we have these suto delivered they are a great healthy sub for potato chips and the snack bags are a perfect size great crunch and we enjoy all the flavors . 
these are my favorite chips ! the bbq and salt pepper are the best ! br br the texture of these things rock ! br br all nicely packaged br br gluten free if you care i do n't but some have commented on that . 
these chips are tasty and low in calorie if you are gluten free they are a great option as a to go snack we love them . 
the product arrived quickly all bags and chips were in place and safe d these chips are delicious and only four ww points ! . 
overall the chips were very tastey my pickey daughter even liked then so that is a real plus for me some flavors were better but all did meet my expectations try it and see for yourelf , enjoy . 
this chips are really good and it 's fun getting the variety pack now , are they as good as regular chips \? probably not , but they 're also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips given that these are a healthier version if you want chips , i would highly recommend them ! . 
i ordered this case of chips as a deal with some vita coco and it was a stellar deal this size bag is perfect for snacking the assortment of chips is great , there 's something in there for everyone . 
love pop chips ! the assortment package was a great find but would liked to be able to choose the flavor varieties i wanted did not care for the sea salt and vinegar flavor but all the rest were great ! . 
delicious , light and full of flavor it 's difficult to decide what my favorite flavor is , but bbq is amazing ! i was impressed with the packaging , but i ca n't imagine it is too cost efficient or eco friendly that is my only complaint great product and guilt free snacking . 
love these popchips they are all great do not care for the salt pepper flavors i wish manufacturer would come up with a variety pack that did n't include that flavor as that flavor is just wasted with each purchase i make \( and i 've made alot ! \) the bbq , original , salt vinegar and sour cream onion chips are superb ! . 
i love popchips they may take some time getting used to if you 're used to the oiliness of potato chips , but they 're only 100 calories per bag buying a 24 pack saves you money per bag , but you 're sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around ! . 
i'm very picky when it comes to chips i 've gone through so many , but this one really hits the spot it has just the right amount of crunch , with just the right amount of flavor it 's also great to know that you 're not eating something that 's bad for you with 100 calories a pack , it 's definitely the ideal snack ! . 
i loved this product , and it was better than what i thought it was going to be my favorite was teh salt and vinger flavor \( yum yum \) but i hated the cheddar , and salt pepper ones . 
i am not going to lie i will give you the strait dope these things are like crack br br i will polish off about 4 5 pages of these easily in a day \( hence the freshman 50 ! that i have gained ! \) lol br br if you love these , i suggest balancing them out with some kind of carb blocker . 
really really tasty br much healthier than almost every other potato chip br a variety of flavors , consider this a huge sampler br br sea salt vinegar is crazy sour personally , i think they overdid it on the vinegar br it 's hard to stop at one serving , but i take this as a sign of a good snack p . 
my subscription of popchips arrived on time and not damaged i love the fact that i receive a great variety of chips which are healthier and at the same time very tasty and satisfying the way the chips are packed for shipping is perfect ! having a subscription is the way to go and of course the price is so right ! ! ! br br thank you , . 
these were awesome ! ! they have a great crunchy texture and flavor and are very filling i bought the variety pack to try all the flavors did n't care for the salt and pepper , but loved the rest will definitely buy more ! . 
it is so wonderful to eat pop chips i am a loyal fan and will continue tasty and healthy br br the flavors are good too and pleasing to everyone with their various choices . 
what can i say if you 've had popchips in the past and love them then no better place to pick them up i love these chips and have bought them without an issue from amazon br br thanks . 
i won them off a penny auction site my 2 year old likes them plenty i do n't think there is any potato flavor , they taste more like ricecakes to me , but are ok the salt and vinegar is strong holy cow ! ! . 
i do love popchips they work well with weight watchers , taste great and the crunch ca n't be beat this pack has many flavors , with the salt and vinegar being my favorite , my husband loves the salt and pepper and my kids like original and cheddar br br the one i miss is sweet potato it is by far my favorite of the whole lot of flavors , but are n't included in this variety pack . 
i was looking for a quality , low points \( weight watchers \( ww \) \) , crunchy , salty snack i cannot stay on a diet if i feel deprived ww 's website had a coupon for these pricey chips never had a popped chip before , so i gave it a whirl br br wow , the best crunch and flavor of all reduced calorie chips i have ever tried better than other brands' popped chips i have tried since i need portion control help and these little bags for 3 points do it for me the variety pack helps to break up any monotony my favorite flavor is the bbq i am not a vinegar kinda guy the salt and vinegar flavor tastes like feet to me love the rest of the flavors i love salt , so the saltiness is just right for me thank goodness my blood pressure is not an issue i need these snackies br br lost 30 pounds so far in 3 months eating these will probably buy them by the case in the amazon auto order system to save on shipping i guess i plan on being a life long fan until something better comes along . 
these are such a treat when you are craving that salty , crunchy snack and the multi box where you get a variety of flavors is perfect share it with son so they do n't get stale but not much chance of that one of my 3 points plus weight watchers snacks that i do n't run out of ! . 
got these at a fraction of the price that they charge at the grocery store this was a great buy thanks , amazon ! . 
i have subscribed these chips they are so tasty not dry or oily cannot put it down once open a bag and have to have two bags in a row . 
i love these chips they are so delicious , it is so hard to eat just one bag all the flavors allow you to taste them all my favorite flavor is the cheese ones go ahead and try them they are so delicious . 
i found these chips originally at a local market however , i have been unable to find them since whew ! what a relief when i was able to locate them these chips have so much flavor , they 're not greasy and they are crunchy i am a chip a holic and these are by far the best chips i have ever eaten . 
these chips are great delicious and are healthier than your regular deli store chips i have first purchased these from a supermarket and found them delicious i found amazon to have them cheaper , and ordered from them as they had more variety of flavor all the flavors were to my liking the only con about this is that they are addicting ! ! ! you are warned ! i purchased these through amazon . 
these are the best chips ever i will buy them again , wish more stores had them the plain chips are my fav . 
i'm sort of a health nut who has weened myself off highly palatable junk food junk food is delicious but it ai n't good for you conversely , healthy food has a bad rep for being disgusting but i honestly think that it 's just something that requires training and acclimatization br br i really like popchips they do n't taste absolutely amazing to be honest but if you 're someone who is trying to kick junk food out of your diet , this is a good way to fulfill a craving without succumbing to unhealthier junk foods each bag is only 100 calories , which is very helpful for portion control br br for me , the taste is great it 's not amazing but it is n't awful sure there are better tasting chips out there but how much more unhealthier are they \? br br i 've tried small bags of popchips from the vending machine \( which i recommend doing before you buy a case \) i have n't tried all over the flavors until i bought the case and i was a little disappointed with half of the flavors in the box fortunately , my boyfriend and i disagree on what tastes good so he likes the flavors i do n't like and vice versa it works out great for us and probably will work out great for family situations and parties where people usually do n't have the tastes however , if you plan on consuming these bags on your own over time i can almost guarantee that there will be a couple flavors that you wo n't like and it might just be worth it if you just buy a couple bags of flavors you do like br br if you 're not accustomed to the taste of 'healthy' food , you might not enjoy these at first either way , pop chips are worth a try probably not by the case though i recommend trying out a few flavors if you can find a small bag at the shop or vending machine before you buy a big box of them . 
i bought these to try them out and for the most part it was a success there are 6 different flavors of chips 5 of them were really good the last one though was not the salt and vinegar ones were very vinegary and it was too bitter for our tastes maybe some people like it but not us all in all though , they were mostly very good in both taste and caloric content br i would definitely buy a box with the flavors that i wanted . 
this practically falls under the category of healthy snack well , almost single serving bags mean you wo n't be overeating and the fact that these are n't in anyway greasy because of the way they are made is a huge plus nice crisp crunch the bags are filled with air , which for the most part do a good job of keeping the chips whole on the case that i got , though , two bags containted nothing but broken bits of the rest most only had a couple of broken chips some no broken ones at all i also noticed that you do n't find nearly as much coating from flavoring on your fingers as i 've experienced when eating other chips br br purchasing it by the case to try out all of the flavors is a good idea and a decent value some of the flavors are incredibly strong , to the point that i do n't like them , so i wo n't be ordering this mixed case again salt and pepper just tasted like pepper , making this a very hot tasting chip the seasalt and vinegar is really strong on the vinegar , which is a taste i do n't enjoy i love bbq flavored chips , but again , this was kind of strong i probably would n't purchase the bbq ones in the future , but would n't say no if someone offered them to me the original is really bland compared to these others , but not bad br br the ones i liked the most were the sour cream onion and the cheddar , both with milder flavors br br i 'd give this 5 stars if i liked all of the flavors definitely high marks for the type of chip and the size of the serving and the fact that you can try all of the flavors in one order . 
yes people , these things are healthier than the average chip and not only have flavor , but they taste good ! i am not a big health food person , i 'll take the grease if it makes it taste better these are 100x better than those baked chips my brother tried them while he was visiting and liked them so much it was one of the things he asked i mail him while deployed only draw back to these chips , they are definitely not for dipping . 
tried the bbq popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which were n't that great good healthy snack without giving up the taste so glad i discovered these ! salt and vinegar are my favorite ! 100 cal bag , 3 5g fat bag . 
the chips were delicious i did n't care much for the vinegar flavored chip but the other flavors were great did n't have any guilt eating this healthier snack . 
i eat a bag of these every single day ! they are the best tasting good for you snack ! everyone should at least try them and you will be hooked . 
cheetos ever since i was kid were one of my favorite snacks , i mean who would n't like them \? you ca n't go wrong with the original but decided to give this one a try i'm not a fan of unbearably hot foods but i do like things with with a kick and since this had jalapeno in it i was assuming it was hot not so much if you eat mildly hot foods this should n't bother you at all and definitely not if you like hot kind of food i did n't even find them hot just have a unique kick of cheddery jalapeno flavor i would recommend to buy these at your local store if they carry them because this price on here is just insane , i buy mine for a little over 3 dollars for this bag overall i hope they decide to keep this one , cause they are amazing and yes girls like these kind of snacks too \) ! love ! . 
for you spicy lovers , these jalape ntilde o cheetos are for you the taste is great and i admit i did not expect them to be this good one day i picked up a small bag at the corner store and by the end of the week i had about 4 empty bags in my trash cans office snack a must ! unfortunately this product is too good to last and i fear it will meet the same fate as wasabi funyuns rarely does a spicy type of chip that actually tastes awesome become part of the standard sale roster so enjoy these awesome jalape ntilde o cheetos for as long as they last . 
these are quite tasty and delicious , i love them but the prices here are ridiculous ! ! ! did i say ridiculous \? oh so ridiculous ! ! ! but im here to rate the product not the price 5 stars for the product . 
a little costly but they are good and fresh too , not stale at all would recomend to any cheetos fan . 
this product works great for me i hate spending money on herbs just to use a little and have the rest go bad shortly after i put some herbs \( mostly basil \) in here and they were fresh for a few weeks ! no leakage probs either , the bottom is clearly labeled to twist to lock and the plug stays flush br this thing has already paid for itself in money saved and looks pretty cool in my fridge and on the counter when i'm ready to cook . 
i have had my herb savor for a few weeks now , and i was waiting to write a review until my herbs went bad , so i could tell you how long it takes , but it never happened for the first time ever , i used all of the herbs before they went bad i have not had any problems with leaking everything closes up nice and tight on mine plus , this thing just looks really cool ! . 
i 've had trouble storing fresh basil because i learned a long time ago not to put it in the fridge my cat is attracted to anything in the plant family \( with disasterous results \) this keeps my basil fresh and the cat ignores it ! . 
my wife bought me this for storing fresh herbs and despite initial skepticism i gave it a try it seemed to work well enough for basil , even freshening up some wilted leaves but the seal the deal moment was when i put some fresh thyme in it and put it in the back of my refrigerator where i mostly forgot about it 6 weeks later \( we were gone for 2 weeks on vacation \) i opened it and the thyme was as fresh as the day it was cut i doubt it would sustain all greens for this long but the fact that it kept thyme fresh for over a month longer than a plastic bag in the produce drawer would have made this an easy 10 to justify br br it 's always a nice surprise when a kitchen gadget delivers the goods . 
i bought one of these about 4 or 5 months ago and i love it ! i have kept a combination of rosemary , thyme and parsley they have all kept fresh for more than 4 weeks ! no brown spots , no rotten leaves just perfect br br i highly recommend this product no problems with leaks or the plug not holding . 
i am a college student who loves to cook and this was given to me about 4 months ago i am so impressed with its ability to keep my herbs fresh for such a long period of time it not only gives more options when i am cooking by having fresh herbs available , but also , its easy to clean , and stores easily in my small fridge i really think this is a must have product for everyone ! br br and if interested in a larger one , i attached a link to the company site \( prepara \) , where you can see all their cool and innovative products br br . 
actually saves my basil and cilantro for an extra week or two thats enough reason for me to buy ! before my basil and cilantro would last only a couple days and i would have to toss them out this saves me money and a trip to the market ! . 
i got this in my christmas stocking from my stepfather we 're both foodies , and try to cook like chefs in our homes i love this product i use this one for scallions green onions which until recently always went bad before i could use all of them sometimes i threw out more than 5 , most times 2 or 3 , but i honestly cannot remember the last time i used every single one that is , until now inside the savor pod , they grow and keep for weeks \( easily more than 3 \) i am planning on buying the set of mini savor pods so i can actually use them for fresh herbs storing my herbs in the same container as my onions is not a good idea the only drawback with this product is that the clear plastic cover is a little tricky to remove as others have mentioned , but wrestling with it is ok with me so long as i can use all my product before it goes bad . 
i was amazed at how good this is for canned fruit \( which i normally wo n't touch \) in particular i adore papayas and mangos the fruit juice instead of syrup is also very nice the easy pull top on the can makes this a great item to stash in my desk drawer at work , so that i can have a fruit snack easily even if i was too busy or forgot to bring lunch so far i have n't gotten a can that had any problems the watermelon is n't crunchy of course not ! but it 's good , and certainly not slimy . 
this is great chilled and topped with fresh whipped cream it is my husband 's new favorite dessert br br i do n't find the texture off putting of course , is is n't as crunchy as fresh fruit , but the taste is great br br if i can get my husband to eat fruit instead of ice cream it gets an a in my book ! . 
my 1 yr old granddaughter , and i cannot get enough br and it is good for you ! . 
i'm a big fan of the dirty martini but i simply ca n't eat enough olives to keep up ! br br love this stuff not quite as tangy as dirty sue , but still very vibrant . 
we have reorderd this product many times makes a great dirty martini delivery is prompt , product well packed . 
this is an excellent product we always ran out of olive juice before we ran out of olives when making dirty martinis now we have a terrific source for great tasting olive juice and our dirty martinis have never been better ! . 
the last case \( a different brand \) we ordered from amazon was so terrible we threw away the entire case however , the boscoli brand is very good and we can enjoy a good dirty martini . 
if you like bloody mary 's and dirty martinies this is a must you wo n't be sorry i'm so glad i found this product . 
this stuff is outragous it is simply the best olive juice on the market i tried another brand and it did not come close to boscoli this stuff is actually better than the olive juice that comes from the jar of olives i would highly recommend this product . 
i 've tried a few different 'dirty martini' mix 's , etc but i prefer the actual juice from the olive jar well , as any experienced dirty martini drinker knows you soon have way too many olives and not enough juice boscoli family dirty martini olive juice is the real thing i usually buy 4 of the 25oz bottles and that 'll last me several months shipping is pricey but the bottles come not only packed in peanuts but also bubble wrapped they pack 'em in a sturdy cardboard box and tape it up real well i live in a rural area and usually get my order in about 4 days fantastic experience all the way around . 
he never has enough juice left over from his jar of olives , we therefore end up with more olives then we can eat , just buying the juice makes alot of sense . 
excellent service price for the product , order shipped quickly received in good condition will be ordering again as long as the price stays this good you really ca n't beat the price . 
the olive juice i purchased was not only inexpensive , but has a great flavor i have looked for a long time to buy olive juice for martinis , but i could not find anyone that carried it thanks amazon . 
this product is great if you want a dirty martini , i highly recommend this product and it saves you from buying olives and wasting just to get the brine . 
we use and buy sea salt instead of regular salt like sea salt came as promised in good condition have nothing else to say . 
love this balance blend of oils , especially in mix batters such as pancake , cornbread , cake , etc , a good oil to ingest ! . 
i used to buy these at world market however they discontinued them \( br so i am forced to buy them online ! the rose and violet flavors are good however i did not like the anise flavor because they were too strong and licorice tasting for me br br i carry these in my purse to freshen my breath and they are really good br also the tin is very cute . 
ca n't live without these little jewels not only is there a surprise in the middle , but it takes me right to the french countryside while enjoying them . 
a family favorite these are really unique treats the wonderful taste of flowers the violet and rose are great orange blossom was n't to my liking the company that makes them have been around for hundreds of years they are made in a small french town that was featured in a movie called chocolat . 
i love these i love any floral flavored product the best part is when people ask for a mint or candy or whatever , offer these but do n't tell the flavor the reactions are youtube worthy . 
i ordered these candies for the first time and i am hooked , they just have a hint of rose the flavor is not overwhelming i really enjoy them highly recommended ! unique candy ! . 
the flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we 're all accustomed to , although describing such subtleties is difficult br br one noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt 330mg per 1 4 teaspoon , versus 590mg per 1 4 teaspoon of conventional table salt br br another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is not iodized as our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine , it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet . 
i like it and i find the grinder bottle to be very convenient i like the taste of it and i would definitely buy it again , and considering its healthy use for sure . 
i bought this because my husband wanted to try the french sea salt as it was recommended on a cooking show the grinding mechanism works well and he seems to like it i did not realize , however , that it is not iodized and that may be a concern for some folks who need to make sure they take in enough daily iodine . 
i really liked the taste it is well priced too it is a great and healthy alternative to table salt i even used it on salad . 
this is a fabulous gift ! i ordered 3 and kept one to try and they are awesome ! the presentation is great , chocolates delicate , creamy , crunchy , and tasty , easy to eat , not heavy for a mass produced line , this is a real winner better than most out there in its price range love the 3 different flavors will buy again great hostess gift . 
i ordered this for a friend at south carolina for christmas , i want her to try some italian chocolates , lol ! br br the item was arrived earlier than expected , but , nevertheless , it was well packed and only melts on her mouth , she totally loves it br br three different taste and flavors of ferreros guarantees to give three different yummy joy , mmmmm . 
this item was received early it was packaged well and in excellent shape ! this was a gift and i am sure it will be received well after all , ferrero chocolates what 's not to like ! ! ! br br thanks for the excellent service would use this seller again and would highly recommend ! ! . 
i bought this as my first pack of k cups , its definitely a good buy ! assortments are always a little more expensive , this one is very well priced you get 6 of each and one of them only has 5 , thank god they picked decaf for the small one ! great coffee , if i had n't discovered club keurig i would still be buying these ! . 
we 'll see how these work out in our family over time i'm not sure that i am disciplined enough to make good use of them , although it might be a good technique for teaching my dog they appear to be good for what they are , a very tiny , but healthy , reward right now i can visualize them being used as a reward for following commands , a training tool i was surprised at how tiny these treats were they seem to taste good enough , but they are miniscule ! they are just a fraction longer than a small paperclip and about half as wide , maybe 1 4 as thick br br my dog was a little annoyed , but took it when i gave it to him that was yesterday today he came in excited to get his treat , looked at it as if to say , you 've got to be kidding ! then he took it and ate it a little later i offered him another one he put it on the floor and looked hopefully at his stash of larger treats , but when he did n't get one , he went back and took this one br br i think these might be good for rewards for obeying commands treats \? that 's stretching it br br they may also be good for my son 's dog who rarely gets treats because she 's overweight and would eat the whole entire refrigerator full of food if allowed at least she would get a treat large treats take her 5 seconds she 'll probably inhale these , one second max br br i like the fact that these are low fat , with no added salt , no refined sugar , no artificial flavors , colors or preservatives it says , treats baked with natural peanut butter . 
i use these for training treats i have a large and small dog and this works for both of them they are all natural and my pups love the taste i highly recommend these ! i also tried the three dog bakery apple oatmeal woofers and those were a big hit . 
i 've never been addicted to candy in fact , i do n't usually like candy with the occasional exception of halloween and that moment when you just need something sweet but these little guys , watch out it might seem like a 12 pack is a lot , but hold on to your seat when you put the very first one onto your vestal tongue a 12 pack will seem like there 's a shortage of caramels in the world lol br br i tried to come up with a way to explain the most awesome flavor in the world and i just ca n't to me it 's like eating anything and everything in the world you ate that made you feel like ahhh , that 's it br br i can only hope that the gubment does n't put a tax on it like cigs because then i 'd have to put myself into an institution . 
i am a bzzagent and i recently received a package of these to try i have to say that i absolutely love the flavor of these candies i am usually not a big candy eater , but i have to say that i was really impressed the werther 's chewy caramels were so richly flavored and chewy that i could n't stop at just one \( i usually stop at one for most other candies \) they have a great buttery flavor that makes my mouth water just thinking about them i like the fact that they have some great ingredients , like cream and butter , but i had to deduct one star for the fact that there are artificial flavors in them \( i am an avid label reader and try to stay away from any artificial ingredients \) as far as the taste goes , my kids and my husband were constantly in the pantry looking to grab another candy , so i can confidently say these were a huge hit in our family it was also a great incentive for the kids to eat their vegetables at dinner they certainly cleaned their plate to have a couple of caramels for dessert if you are having a party , these would be great set out in a candy dish there will be none left by the end ! . 
great candy as always from werther's original candy , hard or chewy caramels are but two of the candy they make that is outstanding it seems that you can not keep it in stock and are always out or just have a bag or two left to sale . 
i reviewed werther 's original chewy caramels , caramel chocolates , and creamy filled br hard caramels as a bzzagent and found the chewy caramels came a close second to the br original hard candies still has that great unique caramel flavor from werther 's but br now in a chewable form i prefer the original hard candy as those little gems last br a little longer but these are a nice second choice . 
i received this mix along with a waffle maker as a gift it 's so good that i keep buying this same brand mix when i run out br br i cut the farmhouse waffles recipe in half \( so that 's 1 cup farmhouse pancake and waffle mix 1 egg 5 8 cup water 2 tablespoon melted butter \) and it 's more than enough batter for 2 waffles in a full size belgian waffle maker br br easy to make and very tasty . 
nothing can compare to the waffle mix delivered by stonewall kitchen my mom complained about the price but i think the quality deserves the higher price than the regular pancake waffle mix the waffle comes out golden and crispy i was using the presto 03510 flipside waffle maker . 
i have been making belgian waffles using the stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix for over three years my waffles are undoubtedly the best ever ! ! ! i like my waffles light and crisp i ca n't stand a heavy soggy waffle these just melt in your mouth i have made homemade waffles , but i have yet to find anything that can compare to this mix . 
this is a delicious recipe and ingredients and the one i use a bit pricy but if you do n't mind the price point it makes a wonderful waffle combine this with a waring waffle maker and you could be in waffle heaven . 
i have to laugh at the reviews that said it was too much work so you have to add an egg a little butter ! it is well worth it i am not a cook at all and these come out perfect everytime they are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside my family loves , loves them the only thing different i do is instead of the extra 2 tbsp of water they call for , i add 2 tbsp of vanilla in place of best waffle mix ! ! . 
i had read some favorable reviews of this pancake mix on amazon quite a while ago i had never ordered any , but i came across a can of it in one of those outdoor , camping stores last christmas i have been using it ever since to make my dieting harder , and can honestly say i have never enjoyed the struggle so much pancake mixes are usually one of those things that usually i buy the cheapest i can find , or at least one that i am familiar with i tend to balk at higher priced mixes for the most part but every now and then i get curious of a brand like this one it just so happens that when i visited this camping store , i was getting ready to take a short hike as soon as the holidays were over , and pancake mix has always been one of my staple items to take along unfortunately it was n't 'till i left that i realized that this mix was not one of the just add water ones that we all know and love the best ones always needed your own addition of eggs , milk , butter , etc , and this one is no exception in that respect so instead of enjoying this mix on the trail , i have been making pancakes in the wilds of my very own kitchen i really do n't know what it is about this mix that makes it so good , but it does indeed make some of the best and most delicious pancakes i have ever tasted from a mix they are very light , fluffy , and flavorful , and well worth the price and ingredients that you have to add yourself if you have a pancake fiend in your home , i would highly suggest you buy some of this great mix its cheaper here on amazon than i paid for it and well worth it in my opinion i have had lots of different kinds over the years , and this makes some truly delicious pancakes highly recommended . 
i was expecting great things based on the reviews while it is good , it 's not great i believe my waffles made from bisquick were just as tasty as these , and this costs quite a bit more the instructions are very easy to follow though , and i do like the canister for storage . 
i love this pancake mix i bought my first can from whole foods market about a year ago my only complaint is , for all the work you have to put into making them \( at least the pancakes anyway \) you could just as easily make pancakes from scratch you have to add your own egg , whole milk , and melted butter one thing i have noticed about this mix is that it 's relatively difficult to burn the pancakes it is , however , easy to overcook them . 
what can i say \? \? they are wonderful , and the highlight of each weekend ohhhhhh use soda water for the liquid ! even better ! ! ! . 
i usually make pancakes from scratch and have never found a mix that does n't taste off to me this mix is the best ! ! ! my family and i love the way it tastes and it is so quick and easy . 
this is the best tasting pancake mix in the market and it is so easy to make . 
my family absolutely loves this pancake and waffle mix the texture and taste is the best out there , especially when using our waffle maker you can add fruit and other items to the mix and be as creative as you wish your price is great and delivery ca n't be beat we recommend it to everyone ! ! . 
we use the farmhouse pancake and waffle mix to make delicious belgian waffles in our a href http www amazon com gp product b001bxm2lu waring wmk300a pro professional stainless steel belgian waffle maker a we have tried waffles using a href http www amazon com gp product b003bqpzge krusteaz waffle mix belgian 28 oz a , a href http www amazon com gp product b001eo6bfe golden malted all natural waffle pancake mix , 33 ounce containers \( pack of 3 \) a , a href http www amazon com gp product b001sb1uja maple grove farms waffle mix belgian , 24 ounce \( pack of 6 \) a , and the waffle recipe from a href http www amazon com gp product b0029jytsy aunt jemima pancake mix , 32 ounce boxes \( pack of 6 \) a in a highly \( un \) scientific blind taste test involving my three children , the farmhouse pancake and waffle mix was the unanimous choice br br i make a triple batch according to the instructions although i use only one tablespoon of melted butter instead of three and the batter stores well in the fridge for up to four days the triple batch makes 4 1 2 waffles on our waffle maker and they are crispy , light , and golden brown br br this brand is slightly more expensive per waffle than the normal grocery store brands \( like krusteaz \) , but our family thinks the taste is worth it as an aside , my son has a soy allergy and this mix is free of soy unlike most other brands . 
i love belgian waffles and this mix makes a delicious waffle without all the trouble of making them from scratch they are really good , and i'm fussy i have n't tried them as pancakes yet . 
these pancakes just hit the spot and make me feel like i am eating a restaurant breakfast at home for a lot less money splurge on this and the good maple syrup it really is cheaper than going to denny 's or ihop where a meal for two will be 20 minimum . 
let me start by saying my family loves this stuff it has a fairly strong flavor of vanilla it cooks up nicce and light my problem with this product is the recent price increase it was a good product at a fair price but now it is pricey all in all i would suggest that you order this at least once to taste what good pancakes are supposed to taste like after that i would suggest playing with recepies on your own . 
my family was lucky enough to get this product several years ago from a friend my daughter will not eat any other pancake mix and everyone i fix them for thinks they are outstanding . 
i bought a belgian waffle maker sort of on a whim and i was then confronted with the question what waffle mix do i use \? somehow hungry jack felt like an afront to such a sublime kitchen appliance i read the reviews here on amazon and concluded that despite the rather high price , stonewall would be a great choice bang ! nailed it the first time now , i do n't know if my waffle maker is particularly large deep , but i get only two and one half waffles out of each batch \( following the recipe on the label \) i do n't dare water it down to try to stretch it out and i figure i only got about 10 batches of waffles out of one can the cost per waffle is steep , but these have never failed to come out light on the inside , slightly crisp on the outside , and they have never stuck to the waffle iron grudgingly , even though i see the price has gone up a dollar per can , i will be reordering , but if it goes up any higher , i may have to try another brand . 
i'm sorry not everyone likes this mix , but we love it it is like going to a gourmet restaurant ! \( yeah a gourmet waffle restaurant \) the waffles taste and turn out great , and so easy hard for us to believe , but it seems it 's not for everyone . 
this is the pancake mix we go to when we do n't have buttermilk in the fridge \( do n't think the vinegar trick is worth it so we always do fresh \) to make alton brown 's buttermilk pancake recipe this stonewall mix is a good option and the flavor is the best of any store bought mix by far ! it might cost more , but it really is superior to the other prepared mixes . 
stonewall kitchen products are a big favorite at our house this pancake mix makes the best pancakes you will ever eat we add fresh blueberries to them , and top them with the stonewall blueberry syrup , which you can buy on their website they make wonderful jams and jellies too , as well as sauces , and flavored syrups try this pancake mix though , you wo n't be disappointed ! . 
this is great pancake and waffle batter that was recommended by amazon so i bought it and have been very satisfied with my purchase it makes the best waffles every time i have used it and that being said i am sold on this product i will be ordering more as we really like how easy it is to make i would highly recommend that everyone try this who likes pancakes and waffles it is delicious and very economical . 
i have been using this pancake and waffle mix for about 5 or 6 years and i have to say this is the best the waffles come out crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside i 've tried other mixes but they do not compare to this mix i use the waring pro waffle maker and my waffles come out beautiful everytime i follow the directions on the canister and never have a problem with the results . 
this is the king of pancake mixes easy , foolproof , and delicious , it makes the best pancakes i 've ever tasted we 've been buying it for several years , and the pancakes consistently come out light and delicious simply add an egg , buttermilk , and melted butter cook them on a nice hot skillet for a yummy anytime meal ! . 
makes perfect , delicious , crisp on the outside and soft on the inside , waffles in minutes worth every penny ! . 
i purchased this mix to use with my new presto flipside belgian waffle maker and am very pleased with the results it took 3 cups of this mix to make 6 large belgian waffles and they cooked to perfection after only 4 minutes ! the flavor of this mix is slightly sweet but there is no aftertaste to it like you get with cheap commercial brands like bisquick i 'll be buying more , for sure ! . 
i received this as a gift a few weeks ago it is by far the best home made pancakes i have every had the taste and consistancy is excellent blueberries mix very well with this product and the container is desinged to keep the product fresh and not let moths in you pay a little more but it is worth it in my opinion . 
makes very good , light waffles seems to be exactly the same as carbon 's golden malted waffle mix only this is more expensive . 
bought a great waffle maker two years ago tried many recipes for making waffles , nothing really pleased the family well , until i followed a recommendation to try stonewall waffles believe me it is not like bisquick as i thought it might be , it is so much better i was shocked and well now the family loves them and looks forward to sunday waffles every couple weeks i even double up the ingredients so i can make extras which we cut into smaller sections and freeze them these can then be used for toster waffles and a quick breakfast forget the eggos even as frozen waffles these are great br br what do i like best about them \? the waffles come out light and fluffy they are crisp and hold up well to being filled with strawberries , nuts or whatever toppings you may choose in no way do they feel heavy or soggy they are a snap to prepare , and take just 3 minutes in the waffle maker lastly the whole family loves them so despite the higher price it is well worth every penny . 
bought this mix along with the cuisinart waffle maker delicious we followed the directions and it made only one belgian waffle the next time we doubled the recipe and it came out the right amount good flavor and easy to use . 
i have a waring belgian waffle maker and was looking for a good batter to use i tried this based on reviews and with add my strong recommendation for this mix br br it was very easy to make and the waffles had a wonderful flavor loved the malt flavor that came through br br i will definitely be buying more when the current mix runs out . 
this mix makes great tasting waffles a little extra work and expense but worth it need to stretch the recipe a little bit to make 2 full waffles on my new presto flipside belgian waffle maker . 
i got this as a gift and liked the flavor but i was n't crazy about the texture i like fluffy pancakes and believe it or not , imo , aunt jemima 's buttermilk ready mix is the best one out there and it 's so easy to make br of course , the best tasting waffles are made by me from scratch with buttermilk and all \) br overall , i think buying gourmet pancake mix is one of the biggest waste of money and it still requires you to put melted butter , milk , etc br i am sticking with my own recipes and aunt jemima 's if i am in a hurry . 
stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix is our favorite consistently excellent with a nice malty flavor the 33 ounce cans are a good value for the quality i highly recommend this product . 
this mix is the kids' and family favorite it tastes like vanilla it 's wonderful for pancakes or waffles . 
this waffle and pancake mix is delicious ! you can taste a subtle hint of vanilla in them they are the only pancakes waffles that my kids love and the house smells wonderful when they are cooking ! . 
my family loves waffles we have been trying to make homeade waffles for a while but when my second child was born , we got tired of all the mixing and measuring we chose this batter mix because the reviews were so great they take no time to mix the dough comes out a bit runny but if you fill the bottom of the waffle iron completely , you get the fluffiest belgian waffles we are using the chefman rotatable iron i highly recommend this batter if you like waffles quick you can add a little cinnamon and sugar too to spice it up . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b001e5e29a stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix , 33 ounce cans \( pack of 2 \) a br the family said they were the best that i had made the 10 grandchildren ate all that was served to them br the parents , who i have served pancakes to for a long , also said they were the best they have eaton it was good to see the little ones clean up their plates . 
we have pancakes once a week and this is our go to mix it is incredibly easy to prepare , and i add a handful of chocolate chips , pieces of banana strawberries peach slices or whatever else people would like onto the individual pancake while it is cooking in the pan no need to buy different flavors you can customize it yourself . 
we first had stonewall waffle mix when we received it in a gift basket about a year and half ago we have been using it ever since the flavor of the waffles are absolutely out of this world we wo n't ever go back to bisquick for our waffles ! . 
this has become a breakfast staple for our home now nearly every sunday morning , we are making pancakes we 've got the vermont mapel syrup , eggs , sausage or bacon and we 're set for the day with a just a light snack type dinner use bettermilk for the absolute best results . 
great mixed for belgium waffles , family thinks it 's the best must try it and order it from amazon i let friends know to use this product . 
i found it so hard to believe anyone could give this mix 1 star , i had to read those reviews two of them seem like ads for robs red mill , and the other one did n't make any sense you must be looking for pancakes or waffles , so do yourself a favor and give these a go they are delicious . 
the entire family loved this pancake mix it was easy to make and tasted great we tried it with syrup , powdered sugar , as well as fresh strawberries and apple compote i would definately purchase this again the only problem is my family wants this every weekend and i have to double to feed my large family it gets expensive quickly , so i do not order it as often as they would like . 
we love this pancake waffle mix it 's hard to please everyone but this item does the trick crispy , light , tender , yummy ! . 
this was the best pancake waffle mix ever ! wonderful for breakfast or dinner it was a great price and worth it ! my husband and boys kept complimenting the waffles i made and ate them fast i could hardly keep up definitely recommend stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix ! you do have to add a few ingredients , but it is well worth the effort . 
this product is great just add egg , water , and butter \( i used oil \) i will never make waffles from scratch again . 
we made this purchase based on our daughter 's recommendation and it is as good as she promised we have a new flip style waffle iron and this mix provides us with a wonderful breakfast we add fresh strawberries or blueberries to the top along with syrup and it is scrumdiddlyumptous ! . 
i have had waffles from other mixes that are too sweet i have also made them from scratch br i like my waffles with no sugar in them , because i do n't like too much sugar this mix is very good waffles are just the right consitancy for me and the mix is easy to prepare . 
we received a gift box that contained the stonewall farms pancake mix and they were out of this world they are the lightest , fluffy and flavorful pancakes and waffles you will ever taste and the price on amazon is a big savings over ordering from stonewall farms do n't shy away from the larger size and the two pack because you will devour these pancakes in no time . 
this is a great waffle mix ! i have allergies to preservatives and to find food in general that is great tasting without the preservatives is a huge challenge i have tried several other mixes and this one is by far the best i totally do n't understand the reviews about the bad taste and all the chemicals read labels of other mixes and you will see this one is not full of all those ingredients there are certain kinds of ingredients that these mixes need , such as levening , and when you use real butter , not the tub butter that contains water and other nasty stuff , these are the best waffles ever ! . 
this lands in the gormet category for sure having these pancakes is like going to a resturant and having exceptional pancakes that you would expect to get at home the price is a bit high but you know that before you buy them so its not fair to downgrade the product bnecause of that br br they cook up nicely and one pack of two goes a long time . 
i use this as the base for my waffles use 2 small bananas mashed , 3 4t cinammon , 1t vanilla , and 1 2 cup gratted pecans and then blend it all together you need to let it cook a much longer period of time at a lower then normal temperature and you need to cut back on the amount of water used you need to know what the consistency of the waffle mixture should be before you attempt this recipe so that you can determine the amount of water to use this is a somewhat tricky recipe since it 's easy for the waffles to stick and pull apart one banana makes it easier but i 've had some success with three bananas banana 's are better overripe . 
i'm not normally a big fan of mixes but this is a great waffle mix it 's quick , easy , and produces delicious waffles yes , it 's pricier than some of the other mixes on amazon but i think it 's worth it . 
this is a great mix i mixed it with milk instead of water just follow the directions . 
this is my favorite waffle mix \( it can be used to make pancakes too , but you have to add milk , and we do n't usually have milk in the house \) you have to add water , 1 egg , and melted butter for the waffle recipe we eat waffles about once a week br br apart from the fact that it tastes great \( it has a little vanilla and malt mixed in \) , it has no trans fat some pancake waffle mixes , such as krustead 's which also tastes really good , say they have no trans fat per serving , but if it has partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in the ingredients , there is still some \( less than than 1 percent \) trans fat per serving stonewall has none br br we used to have a store that sold it locally , but now we do n't so i am glad we can get it online br br the can comes with a recipe that is perfect for making two belgian waffles with no leftover batter br br we just bought the regular mix but we are going to try the other flavors next . 
i originally received this mix as a gift from a friend in a gift pack when my family tried it as a gift they loved it immediately it is super yummy waffle mix the waffles turn out tasting so delicious you do not need to add any toppings or butter to them here i am on amazon com placing yet another order for this waffle mix , it goes quickly around my house since it is now everyone 's favorite breakfast item . 
we are into our third can of this flavorful and easy mix and it just seems to get better and better ! sunday is pancake day at our house , and today we had blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup this mix holds fresh blueberries nicely do n't over mix the ingredients and you will get nice , fluffy fruit filled \( or not \) pancakes that are absolutely first rate . 
we first received stonewall pancakes as a gift we have ordered them 2x on amazon who has the best prices highly recommend this product will return here to buy more . 
i bought this on a whim because i found some jam made by the same company and absolutely loved it i did n't expect much more than basic waffle and pancake mix this is so much better br br it 's easy to use and makes moist , fluffy pancakes that are to die for i am never buying bisquick again . 
i have used this product for a few years now this being the first time from amazon i'm glad it was there this is by far the best pancake waffle mix on the market bar none ! . 
the pancakes were delicious , but they were n't as fluffy as the ones i normally make next time i use this , i'm going to whip the egg whites and see if that helps . 
i found these at a super gold box pricing one day otherwise i would not have looked twice at 16 00 pancake mix now we are hooked nothing compares to this mix i 've tried every box in the store for our belgian waffle maker and these top them all ! br waffles are nice and crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside they are so dense they do n't absorb syrup or toppings i will buy this over and over again . 
on a whim , i picked up a two pack of stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix recently , enticed in some measure by the already positive reviews here and i will add to those by noting that we will be keeping a supply on hand in our pantry br br i really did not expect that this easy to prepare mix would yield waffles better than the from scratch recipes i had been using , but now the waffle iron is stashed within easy reach after being banished to the recesses of the cabinets for the last few years br br being able to whip out crisp , airy , light , malty waffles does wonders for one 's popularity in the kitchen , and pairing these with real maple syrup and fresh blueberries is the way to go . 
no matter how you mess up the recipe , this mix still makes my family happy in the sunday morning \) . 
i hope amazon restocks this item always i ca n't stand the other brands out there since it got this brand and the price is right at amazon to . 
heavily touted by the reviews , decided to try mix is good , but not great probably would n't buy again . 
this is the best pancake mix ! i 've sent this to several people , and they all love it the two pack makes a nice little gift . 
recently , my life partner was complaining about our same ole breakfast every morning that is when i discovered that he loves pancakes i was aware that he liked waffles \( we 've only been together almost five years ! \) i , on the other hand , have never cared for pancakes i loved my gram 's waffles , but nothing she did could tempt me to eat pancakes , no amount of butter or slathering with strawberry jam could make a difference i just did n't care for pancakes ! she did insist on teaching me how to make and cook them , because my daddy enjoyed pancakes , so i learned br i was in central market on saturday when i ran into a co worker and her husband they took me by the hand from the baking products isle to the jams , jelly , syrup , honey isle on the top shelf was the very best pancake mix stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix i saw the price and took a deep breath , it was twice the price of the mix i had just been contemplating purchasing on their recommendation , i tossed it in the cart along with some real organic , light amber , maple syrup br this morning , i fixed three small \( 3 inch diameter \) pancakes for my man and one for myself just to taste i needed to know ! br well , i do n't believe i have ever had real maple syrup before in my life , just that sugar processed krapola sold as pancake syrup i have never liked that stuff ! br that pancake with a tiny dribble of real maple syrup was delicious ! it was the pancake mix that made the difference br now i am reading reviews to purchase a waffle maker after tasting that light , fluffy pancake , i can hardly wait to have some waffles made from this mix these reviews are making my mouth water with anticipation ! br i will never buy any thing else . 
i'm not sure why , but this is our favorite pancake waffle mix just tastes the best to us . 
i hope amazon always carries this product too i have ordered it twice excellent product for the price yum o ! . 
as a new keurig owner , i'm trying as many sampler packs as possible to determine what both my husband and i like the most br br although quite pricey and not coming in the cute gift box some other crazy cups purchases have been received in , i am enjoying this variety thoroughly it is almost entirely iced drinks and this sampler pack had a good mix of the following br br southern sweet tea , unsweetened black tea , raspberry sweet tea , peach sweet tea , sweet lemon tea , half half tea and a few different iced coffee k cups additionally , there were a few seasonal island coconut which my husband loves br br i would consider purchasing variety packs as my main source of k cups , but at a price of over 90 cents a cup i ca n't justify the cost however , this is a good starting point to narrow down some favorites to purchase in single flavor boxes ! br br if these were presented in the gift boxes they use for other samplers , this would be a very ideal gift house warming present for these hot summer months ! i do n't mind them not being in a gift box , but i could have at least used that as an excuse to myself for the price . 
very good price and we love our keurig trying the summer flavors are great and will probably order more before the end of the summer . 
i have n't had a chance to try these out yet , but i thought i would go ahead and mention that i received 5 each of the following 7 flavors br br sweet rasberry black iced tea br southern sweet iced tea br sweet lemon iced tea br french vanilla iced coffee br nantucket blend iced coffee br gingerbread coffee br eggnog coffee br br fortunately i'm okay with this , as i was wondering how the gingerbread and eggnog tasted as well you might feel differently though , and might want to know since this seems to be the only variety pack of iced k cups . 
there are some types i really like especially southern sweet tea \( which is actually a lot less sweet than southerners really make it \) the raspberry and peach are also good , and not overly sweet urologist has banned artificial sweeteners from me as they do kidney damage br br i did not care for the herbals , and thought there was a bit too much green tea in the assortment but i found friends who like those flavors br br it was to taste test , and it was fine for that i do n't think i will buy assortments again , as i have found what i really like . 
i got this on a special and we are coffee lovers and like to try different kinds although yuban is our everyday coffee well this was a surprise ! nice and flavorful , not bitter , smooth and maybe not as strong as yuban in the same amounts the was all there if they start selling this in lagers amounts for a better everyday price i would buy more but as is its very pricey . 
this was a new product to me they were very tasty , crisp , and surprisingly delicious i was very pleased with this product . 
i was very pleased to stumble upon this brand , as it is difficult to find healthy snacks for families that do n't contain gmo ingredients these were a big hit with kids and grown ups alike added bonus that they are low in calories and gluten free i would highly recommend the sweet potato flavor , as well as the brand in general great new company ! . 
this product was a gift to a far distant relative it arrived right on schedule , in perfect condition and she loved the choices inside the basket i cannot attest to the food personally , but she loved it ! . 
i always disliked soggy or soft crackers with my peanut butter and since i also had discovered i was allergic to wheat , i wanted and needed an alternative i originally found these kame rice crunch crackers in kroger supermarkets from the first bite , i loved them , and i wished i had discovered them years ago the plain variety has just the right amount of salt for taste , and they are perfectly crunchy and light i 've occasionally had a hard time finding them , so i'm thrilled that amazon is now carrying them give these a try , they are delicious ! ! . 
these things are addicting and low in calories and fat too i love the wasabi flavor . 
i would recomend this product for it 's fine qualities and taste really good very nice and crisp for any snack or with meals when you want to help on the lowering of carbohydrate intake . 
these crackers are a great snack ! no cholestoral , and they use sea salt very crunchy , so its like eating potato chips , but better for you comes in different flavors , but i prefer the plain i have found that the salt content is different on some purchases , sometimes very salty and sometimes hardly any salt , must be a problem on the production line these crackers become addicting , but its ok cause rice is good for us ! . 
i'm so dissapointed these are unavailable right now ! i love these crackers with cream cheese it 's my favorite snack ! i hope they become available again soon ! i ca n't find them anywhere ! . 
i got 1 pack of these from my local grocery store and tasted them for the first time to me , they taste just like corn nuts they are quite hard , so i would n't recommend to anyone who does n't like hard foods they are crispy and delicious snacks tho will buy more d . 
this is an excellent product for the non gluten diet they 're good alone as a snack , or you can make a light meal with them by using these rice crackers as a base for spreads or little crispy sandwiches excellent substitute for crackers containing gluten only criticism wish the price would come down . 
not as good as sesmark savory rice minis , but these are available at least they are very good more healthy than potato chips and a bigger crunch mmmmmmmm . 
first time buyer of ka me rice crackers and i'm very impressed these are very light , crisp and flavorful they are as good plain as they are with cold cuts , fruit , etc unfortunately , the ones i purchased may be the last i get from this source right after i purchased the dozen packs , the price per dozen increased 44 to its present 37 99 fortunately , i have enough to last a while , but assuming the price stays the same , these are my last ka me . 
crackers are great was glad to find them there is a good selection of flavors my favorite is salted , but there are other choices . 
local availability of the plain variety of these crackers has been unpredictable with stores trimming inventory and dropping all but the highest volume skus buying on subscription makes it affordable and , so far , reliable . 
these rice crackers are truly delicious w cheese or peanut butter also i can eat crackers w o gluten as i am allergic to wheat , eggs , gluten , and bannas br this is my favorite snack on sunday nights they come promptly and save me money thank you j wolf . 
i love these crackers ! perfect snack for when i need something salty crunchy instead of potato chips or other greasy snack i eat them a lot to hold me over between meals the price on amazon is great compared to my local markets highly recommended ! . 
bottom line , these crackers are a great snack ordering by the case saves some money compared to the 3 45 charged locally whether plain , onion , or sesame \( i 've never tried the wasabi \) these are a low fat , reasonable calorie snack eaten either plain or with something on it the only sad thing is that i first ordered them in 2008 for 21 per case . 
i too have begun to drink only penta water unless absolutely neccessary to drink the other water i find that the price of the water is cheaper from the actual website and i get free shipping i feel better overall and wish i could get this stuff by the gallon great product and well worth the price for the improved feeling of well being . 
you can purchase this for 35 00 including free shpping straight from penta 's website br br i really enjoy drinking this i can see a difference with my everyday life . 
i bought bottles of this stuff because of its purity i have a vpi record washing machine to get the gunk out of the grooves in my record collection you basically scrub the records and vacuum the glop off using a mix of water and detergent this water is so pure it ever sinks deeper in the grooves and is a visably better penetrating fluid compared to distilled water much less tap \( oh no ! \) water with all its impurities you would n't believe how great my records play once they are deep cleaned my wife can always tell when i am playing vinyl instead of a cd it just sounds more alive she says this water is highly recommended for this purpose i may even drink some of it sometime to see what all the fuss is about . 
i love this water it is very uplifting i feel better drinking it it is arsenic free , flouride free , chromium 6 free , chlorine free , and mtbe free something about reverse osmosis and medicinal grade oxygen really works at work , we are no longer allowed to drink soda in our classrooms , so i bought some penta water i am hooked i like the one liter size bottles i wish you would sell those also ! i was lucky to purchase this at dorthy lane market ! buy this water ! . 
these are my most favorite nut snacks sunflower is my absolute favorite , but the almond , cashew \( very buttery and rich \) , and seasame are really great , too have given as gifts and everyone follows up to ask me where they can buy them great for the kiddos , too ! . 
i love this candy and ate it a lot as a kid it has been very hard to find in any stores i am so glad i found it on amazon the shipping was fast and the product arrived in excellent condition it still has the same flavor after all of these years try this candy if you love coconut you will love it too ! . 
this freeze dried ice cream is great ! it tastes exactly like the more expensive kind with the astronaut on the package , for a fraction of the price after receiving this , i understand why it costs less than the astronaut kind the packaging stinks on ice br br normally , freeze dried items are packaged in air tight , foil type packages , so as to not permit light , and most importantly , air into the package air is the enemy of freeze dried items , because it contains moisture the product arrives it is in an air tight can , which you need to open with a can opener inside , the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will not keep air out of the product br br it gets worse the paper wrappers are not only not air tight , but they are also all slit open every serving is slit open in several places the can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible this may or may not keep the product fresh , but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can br br with mine , i got as much air out of the bag as i could , by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw i then sucked the air out until i could get no more air out , then slipped the straw out , whilst closing the bag in one swift motion you must do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving , or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream so be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product . 
my 17 month old can easily eat the whole can in one day if i 'd let him he loves these puffs ! he just munches on them like they are chocolate \( or something that one really loves ! \) i just lay a bunch on his little table and he will just pick them up so fast and as soon as he is done he 'll start whining for more he does not do that with any other snack ! it 's insane ! i have tried them and i must confess they are good , but can get expensive if baby gets addicted to them i obviously buy these in bulk we 've only tried the carrot cheese i think the other flavor because of the green color may confuse him but i will try those as well as soon as we are done with this pack ! . 
i purchased these for our 10 month old twins a while back and they absolutely loved them they are now 13 months and still love them they prefer them over the happymelts , even though they like those as well below is my pro cons list br br pros br both babies love them br they are overall healthy , have less sodium , etc than other products of the same type of snack br a lot of munchies in each container br great price on amazon with subscribe save br br cons br they are messy as they easily crumble and there are a lot of tiny crumbles in the bottom of the container br this particular flavor is sort of flavorless to me , however , my twins seem to disagree with my taste buds . 
i am a mom of 3 kids with my older two i had such a hard time finding a snack for them that did n't have so much sodium ! when my 3rd came along , happyfamily introduced happymunchies i was so thankful to find a snack low in sodium and with a vegetable too ! and to top it off , it is organic so i know it is free of pesticide residue and gmos ! . 
baby loves to feed herself and these are a great on the go option we have tried other brands \( gerber \) but this is her favorite by far and i do n't feel bad giving them to her as i know that they are high quality hubby tries to steal a few away here and there as well \) . 
i 've bought them many times good quality and good taste , baby love it , and i love it too reccommend it . 
while i worry that i am teaching my baby to be a snacker , these are perfect for the in between times for my 1 year old grazer the label tells me that they are a healthier choice for my baby than the typical grocery store aisle alternative i like to keep these in the car and diaper bag for helping to calm my little one while waiting for meal , etc i do n't think they taste awesome , but he sure eats them like they are going to disappear that makes me happy ! . 
we love these the cheddar carrot flavor is far better than the green flavor my daughter , age 2 , likes them both , but because we snack on them in the car i opt for the cheddar carrot which is tasty to me too i love that they are healthy and i can feel great about giving her these instead of some brightly colored mystery things love em . 
my two boys love the happy munchies cheddar cheese carrot they request them as their snack as they watch their show on t v i love that they are low in sodium , includes 25mg of choline per serving \( which is great for their eyes \) and tastes great also , they are kosher certified which is a plus as well i love to put these in baggies and keep them in my purse for emergency snacks on the go healthy , crunchy and a must buy . 
my 1 year old son does really like these andthey certainly taste better than some of the other finger food snacks the only issue is there are lots of crumbs in the can they come in , so it gets messy if you want to dump them into a baggie for on the go . 
these are a great alternative to chips i was n't sure how they would be based on other reviews but i am glad i bought them and wish i would of found them sooner i have twin 18 month olds and they ca n't get enough of them i like them too ! . 
my son is only 9mo , so he ca n't say it yet , but he loves these he gets excited when i even take them out of the pantry ! ! i like the fact that they are organic and also have carrots . 
my son loves them and i can give them to him knowing they melt in his mouth so wo n't choke and they are good for him too . 
happybaby happymunchies baked organic cheese and veggie snack , cheddar cheese carrot , 1 63 ounces \( pack of 6 \) br br hello , this is six items should be installed , but i only received a , i with amazon contact but nobody reason i , please verify as soon as possible , give me reissue , thank you ! ! ! ! . 
i purchased this at my local health food store and i am enjoying it immensely the juice has a nice , robust texture , and it is not overly salty the flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing br i combine it with odwalla flash pasteurized 100 carrot juice for a well above average vegetable juice that is a good energy booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices br enjoy ! . 
we love these baby food things in a little pouch sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added just fruit for smaller ones , not good to let them handle it themselves , because they love to squeeze it , which gets things everywhere but older ones can feed to themselves i like the 3 17 size rather than the bigger one that plum organics has for some of the other flavors it assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later you can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives not the case with the bigger pouches i also like that it is bpa free if your little one likes them , ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store . 
i discovered these when my daughter was about 15 months old i wish i had found them earlier they are organic , taste great , are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient ! i always keep some in my purse and in the car when we 're out and about they are not messy , unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch , which only happens for us when she 's not hungry br br the plum organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together they taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies you can find some varieties at reasonable prices on amazon , others are more expensive for some reason babies r us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for 1 each if you buy them in sets of 8 that is usually when i stock up for the next two months \) . 
my daughter will start school this fall and i was concerned about lunches and fruit to go choices we 've bought several different fruit pouches at a local organic store and she and i loved these the most it it not overly sweet \( and a strawberry variation as well \) , tastes really good she can easily eat 2 of these every day br i really like the fact that it has no sugar and color added it is organic just fruit puree br br i , personally , do n't like banana variation , but it 's just because of my own personal preferences \( i like fresh bananas more than cooked \) , other than that , my daughter approved all of flavors to 10 stars . 
plum products are such a wonderful and yummy idea for the toddler , heck even the adult from time to time i keep a full stock of every flavor fruit pouch plum makes for toddlers they make a great snack to throw in the diaper bag or back pack , whether you are packing a for a trip to the store , school lunches or going to disneyland ! these pouches have saved the day many many times i have even grabbed one or two to add to my lunch when no other fruit was available for me , and it was really good ! i have and will always recommend plum to every parent i know ! . 
i love plum organic pouch got this one on sale my baby and toddler love this so much my 3 years old always ask me for more . 
my son loves these and they are great to throw in your diaper bag or take with on trips a lot of time i ca n't find fresh fruit while we are out and about that my son \( he is 1 \) can eat these are great because it is actual fruit and he can eat it straight from the pouch just make sure you help them the first couple of times or else you might have a bit of a mess . 
have had other brands like this before , and have always enjoyed them these were a really good bargain on sale . 
my 8 month old loves this has no problem holding it sucking the food out this is great for on the go ! . 
this makes feeding on the go so easy ! my one year old will suck down a pouch in 5 minutes and she loves them ! . 
i bought this for my 15 month old son who has become a very picky eater as of late i wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and veggie servings each day this does the trick ! he loves them and he can feed himself what more can i say \? \( oh , i actually tried one , and they really are good ! \) . 
i tried this product because it was a friday special and it caught my eye it being 100 fruit and 100 organic i do n't have any children , but this looked interesting to try because i 've been trying to eat healthier and sometimes it 's hard to get my recommended amount of fruit servings a day i buy fruit but it always seems to go bad before i can eat it all i bought the banana mish mash also , and really like it , too i like to add it to my oatmeal , or spread it on top of my peanut butter toast , or just by itself ! to clarify the ingredients it has 3 different fruits , not just peach and not just banana obviously , i'm ok with this just wanted to throw that out there there are multiple things i love about this product here goes and not in any particular order br 1 \) easy to open , convenient , resealable pouch br 2 \) it tastes great ! br 3 \) all natural , 100 fruit no nasty preservatives or chemicals br 4 \) 100 organic br 5 \) great for everyone , not just babies br 6 \) the price is good compared with other similar products , and i love the free shipping ! . 
not as tasty as the strawberry but still very nice great to throw in a diaper bag or purse spendy but definitely a good deal when it 's on sale . 
these are awesome and if you know where to find the discount codes they can be super inexpensive i love the all natural ingrediants and i actually find them to taste great i actually put a little in my older kids oatmeal and they love it too i make 90 of my daughters baby food but this great for on the go or as a supplement br br my twin niece and nephew who are 18 months old love these as a snack and my sister says they are so great for car rides or trips to the museum i highly recommend these over any other baby food product . 
this is perfect for babies and toddlers on the go ! we started using the baby version when my daughter was an infant it is so easy to throw a pouch and a baby spoon into the diaper bag now that my daughter is older , she is able to feed herself with the pouch just give your toddler the pouch and they will squeeze suck the fruit out of it not only is the packaging great , but the fruit tastes good as well \( and yes , i have tasted everything that i feed my daughter \) my daughter loves this her whole face lights up when i hand her a pouch . 
well , maybe i'm the first one to review this wonderful treat , but i know i'm not the first one having tried them ! this treat is so safe , healthy , and yummy ! in my native language , miam miam is for yum yum ! br there you go not too sweet , yet not lacking sweetness you ca n't taste one ingredient above the other one \( ok , besides the coconut , since it 's mostly made of it \) , it 's so good br br this is a raw food product that has been dehydrated at low temps , it 's really nice to give to our kids \( we have 7 of them , and they love it \) of course it 's a bit more expensive than your average treats candies , but hey , who wants to complain \? br br do you want crappy candies with dyes , chemicals and cooked \( so basically poison \) , or you want to give real food for yourself and your kids \? br br i bet if people learn to do prepare these treats and give that to their kids , school would be less filled with asperger syndromes , add , adhd kids etc br br this is a treat that you wo n't regret having spent money on it , unless of course you are so used to the chemical loaded pesticide herbicide overly cooked high fructose corn syrup dyed candy , then it 's not for you br br keep your money instead , you 'll need it for the bills you 'll have when you go to the numerous docs that ca n't help you and your kids sorry \( . 
delicious and nutritious ! we live for coconut and nut treats since we do n't eat grains when i want to splurge , i pick up a bag of these from whole foods or my local indie health store they average around 10 here unless they 're on sale \) i 'd looove to be able to buy these in bulk yum yum ! . 
i am just passing along the 5 star rating from our three miniature schnauzers this stuff is a big hit at our house we give them each an easy to digest kibble that 's good for them and put a tablespoon of pot pie on top no more turned up noses now they wolf it all down be sure to mix it up real good before serving . 
i just switched from merrick whole earth brand pate style to this upgraded line by merrick and my dog loves it ! this a great for dogs that like human food . 
we adopted an 8 year old dalmatian earlier this year , and heard lots of cautionary tales about special diet but we could n't pass up trying a can of this dog food sadly , just because of the name well , she loves it ! so now it 's her special occasion food we mix half a can with a cup of dry , 2x day , with no nasty side effects she also likes wingaling and the napa valley offerings from this company it 's high in protein and works for us ! . 
so happy we found this online for a reasonable price my two dogs love this stuff and it does n't upset their stomachs plus i love that it 's not made in china or something when you look at the food , it looks pretty close to people food you can see real chunks of chicken and veggies i do n't want to give my dogs any manufactured stuff but also do n't have the time to make our own dog food . 
i give merrick canned food as a treat and mix it to my dog 's dry kibble \( and the cat even gets a taste \) every now and then the chicken pot pie smells better than any human chicken pot pie i can remember . 
my dog thinks he was born into the gentry and is entitled to fine dining each evening accordingly , he will not eat plain kibble a scoop of this on his dry food , a little water to make gravy and we 're good to go ordering a case from amazon was way easier than picking up individual cans at the pet store , too all in all , a success for us . 
i switched to merrick dog food several years ago \( 2007 \) when all the dog food seemed to be tainted with the rat poison specificlly aminopterin and was getting worse by the day br br my dog is my life and i would have been devastated to know i had fed her something that would have caused the suffering and anguished death and illness that many of these pets had been forced to endure so , i started to look around and found it appalling that there was such little oversight in pet food manufacture and control regarding ingredients and labelling i knew that it was not natural for dogs who had been carnivores for thousands of years to be eating all this processed scrap and bonemeal no matter how the companies tried to re label it i also though , knew how critical it was for animals to get critical micro nutrients in appropriately balanced levels and it could be equally devastating for someone uneducated in animal nutrition to think that they could just 'home cook' meals which could leave gaping holes in these essential minerals , vitamins and micro nutrients not to mention the ratios of fats , oils , proteins that the animals need so , i was searching for a company i could trust ! br br i found merrick and have not turned back ! we have never been happier and use both grammy pot pie kibble as well as some of these canned dog food cans though since 'we' are a small dog we use the smaller sized cans \( cat food sized 5 5oz \) the cans are ironically enough filled with ingredients that you can read and understand you can also go to their website and find out what any ingredient that may sound 'foreign' really is and why they used it i found out they were almost always a natural ingredient that is an alternative to a processed chemical i also found it comforting that particularly with the canned food i could open it and recognize ingredients like a potato looking like a suprise , potato ! or a pea , carrot , etc my dog loves this merrick food and has never been healthier ! our vet constantly comments on her blood work levels coming back at perfect levels and she is almost 9 her coat is really healthy and probably what is noticed by most pet owners and yet not the most 'pleasant' aspect to discuss , is that she has almost no gas \( i do n't give her much if any people food either \) but when she is given other brands she can be really hard to sit near on ocassion \) i think the phrase you get out what you put in applies here as well i will not switch from merrick food ever ! my only regret is that i did not start feeding my little four legged one merrick sooner ! . 
this canned food has real chunks of chicken in it dogs love it looks and smells better than human quality canned beef stew \( like dinty moore \) .

now let me start by saying i did not buy this tea as a diet supplement i bought this because i tried it from a local store as i was looking for a tea that had some peppermint in it but not so much it was over powering like a full peppermint tea this has just the right amount of peppermint combined with a green tea overall it is a pleasant taste that i could drink all day . 
this tea is very good i discovered it while visiting in california the moment i got home i searched local stores for it and i was not able to find it finally i decided to see if amazon had it and they did and i bought two boxes as long as they make it i will buy it . 
the tea tastes great and helped me curb cravings during dieting the tea was inexpensive and came packaged in a pretty box the bags are flimsy , but i just throw the bag in a tea ball with no worries i will continue to keep this on hand as part of my tea collection . 
i love this tea it has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea i do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but i can live with that no big deal ! the quality of tea makes up for that . 
i found this exact same stuff at the dollar store it is pretty good not as good or as strong as my loose whole leaf tea , but for the price it ca n't be beat bags are never as good as loose leaf i use it if i want one quick cup i steep my loose leaf tea 2 3 times , so i have to have time to drink 2 3 cups i gave this 4 stars because it is a good deal for the money purchased from the dollar store if i make myself a mug , and because it is cheap , i use 2 bags i would have been disappointed if i had paid the original price on here for it though . 
not much else to say i keep a box in my desk here at work , and i can enjoy a cup anytime ! nice flavor , and no bitterness , so i can drink it straight without sugar ! br br pros flavor and value br br cons it ca n't do my taxes for me that 's really about all i can think of lol . 
i got tired of overpaying for tea at teavana so decided to try this brand of oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised it has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer , i just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags you just ca n't beat the value of this tea ! . 
this is a high quality oolong tea and i ca n't go back to bigelow , that 's for sure ! the taste is great , it is said to have slimming benefits , and the tea bags are a higher quality that do n't come apart easily . 
i got two bags from my friend who got it from his friend who said it was primo so i chucked them in a zip lock when i got home 3 mos later i opened it and had some today i am online trying to find more . 
you just ca n't beat the taste of the original dubble bubble gumballs ! it really does n't matter that the taste only last a minute or so , but that is why i bought the tub ! the tub by the way is very convenient and was shipped to me in a condition ! if your longing for the classic taste go for it ! you will not be dissappointed ! . 
using the entire sauce packet is over kill , leaving a salty greasy puddle at the bottom of the carton otherwise noodles are well made , and sauce is reasonably well flavored quick and easy , a no brainer . 
this is pretty good stuff you ca n't expect a whole lot from instant box o noodles , but this is the best out of all the other brands i 've tried before the noodles have good constancy and the peanut sauce is really tasty as well i'm going to buy more . 
it tastes better than it looks was the first thing i said the a skeptical co worker looking at my peanut satay as it came out of the microwave unfortunately , it 's as fattening as it looks , so i likely wo n't be purchasing it often i could see this mixing with chicken or beef and tasting even better though ! . 
while its not traditional satay it is very good the oil is ok cause without it it would be too dry , i had some of these that were a year and a half old i made it and it was fine , i will buy again . 
i adore this brand of peanut satay noodles unlike the other ethnic foods in box , ka me 's noodles and sauces are flavorful and delicious however , there 's certainly a downside this dish is greasy , fattening , and high in calories if you read the nutritional information , you 'll find that this tiny box contains two servings that are high in fat and not very filling br br my advice \? split this dish with a friend and serve with a small serving of rice the sauce is flavorful and potent enough that it bleeds into the rice an instant and tasty multi dish meal ! . 
a nearby fresh and easy neighborhood market stocks a number of gourmet imported products and i enjoy trying them one is a variety of baxters soups from canada today , i had the butternut squash and red pepper soup quite good smooth and mellow mild taste , but delicious goes down real easy and it only comes to 90 calories per serving \( 2 servings per can \) alas , the sodium content is a bit higher than i like otherwise , very good br br gary peterson . 
i have been using this product for years and was happy to find it on line since our local place \( bristol farms \) had closed i love it especially in my salad dressings . 
the pomegranate molasses arrived on time and in good condition i encountered this as an ingredient in a mollie katzan cookbook and it did not disappoint we thinned it just a little with warm water and used it as a side sauce for roasted asparagus at a barbecue , and got many rave reviews from our guests , vegetarian and non vegetarian alike i recommend both the vendor and this item . 
fast , professional transaction i needed this one ingredient for a new recipe and it turned out great ! now i just need to find more uses for this stuff . 
only pom mol i 've ever used but this seemed to have the same flavor the chef came up with for a pomegranate relish for fish it seems to have a bit of a brown appearance though where the one the chef used was a brighter red color . 
i have two recipes i'm anxious to try that call for pomegranate molasses i 've called all the specialty and best markets in the sacramento area and no one 's heard of this , much less carries it it 's common in mediterranean recipes , goes with shrimp , fish , chicken , beef and pork i was delighted to find it on amazon and look forward to using mine in a fabulous short ribs recipe i'm also passing along the info to my friends so they can order their own or i may give as gifts to my gourmet cook friends . 
i would recommend this product i received it in a timely manner and the price was good . 
pomegranate molasses is my mother 's secret recipe for great meatballs she adds a couple teaspoon of molasses to the meat and the taste comes out incredible br br once i set up my own household she gave me a present pomegranate molasses of my own i learned to use it in variety of recipes from deserts to meat sauces it has a wonderful taste both tart and sweet at the same time it has deep red color , and looks very appealing br br it keeps almost indefinitely in the refrigerator it blends well with walnuts , adds a unique flavor to beans , adds wonderful flavor to poultry , gives a nice taste to fish , gives an astringent edge to salads and vegetables , and is a great tenderizer for lamb and pork br br i like its flavor even just diluted with cold water as a drink or adding tart flavor \( and beautiful color \) to sorbets br br ali julia review . 
so i bought this pomegranate molasses to make fattoush , the delicious middle eastern salad of greens , cukes , tomatoes and torn up bits of fried , leftover pita bread wowee , fattoush is now my favorite salad , i 've eaten so often lately that the tart lemon y dressing has made the corners of my mouth turn a bit pinkish and raw , youch i tend to do that , find a food i really like , then eat it so much i almost make myself sick on it br br anyways , the fattoush salad dressing , with it 's complex blend of sumac , olive oil and various herbs and spices required one half teaspoon of pomegranate molasses i was lucky enough to find it at a russian grocery store \( yay ! \) but the store is far away and so i had to look around online to buy more , thank god for amazon br br now , granted , my bottle will likely last years if all i do with it is make fattoush , one goopy half teaspon at a time , so i 've used it in a few other things i added a teaspoon to a lemon chicken marinade , a tiny glob to a bowl of greek yogurt \( had to add honey too cuz it was sour ! \) , a tiny amount added to christmas salmon cream cheese log , i used it in fesenjen , a persian stew of chicken and walnuts , i used a few tablespoons of the sticky stuff in a garlicky barbecue sauce and it was the best barbecue ever br br just do n't do what i did and try to replace the molasses in molasses cookies with pomegranate molasses , what a horrible mess , the cookies looked normal , slightly lighter than normal , but the smell ! and the taste ! ewwww ! . 
always wanted to make my own hummus and eggplant dip this brand of tahini i 'd never tried before or seen in supermarkets , so i decided to order and try it excellent by itself or in recipes ! highly recommended . 
this was a very good puchase the shipper was very fast and very friendly the tahini was very fresh and of good quality i will order again . 
we love to make hummus , and love to make sandwitches , salad dressings one of our kids favorite foods is tahini over cold undon noodles . 
having lived in the middle east for 10 years , our family loves hummos and we make a lot of it this is the best brand i 've ever found in the u s i like the taste and the texture of this one , and it mixes wonderfully with the other ingredients i found it somewhere locally , then when i went to buy more i could n't find it again krinos is so much better than all the brands you find in health food stores or supermarkets , and the price happens to be about half of what most stores charge for a similar amount of tahini i was delighted to find it on amazon ! . 
i have never used tahini before and my hummus was good , but always , something was missing after i found out of tahini , i ordered it \( and it was shipped extremelly fast \) and used it the result was amazing ! one spoon into the hummus prepared from one bag \( 1lb beans \) and i had my favorite ready to go ! . 
we purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born they make a very nice announcement of the new arrival they are however very hard if you actually want to chew the bubble gum . 
this product arrived in a timely manner , in good condition , and it was a hit with the family when my son arrived . 
when our third child , and first son was born , we sent our oldest to school \( kindergarten \) with these for her friends to celebrate it really made her feel important at school , and helped her celebrate the birth of our little boy she loved doing it , and her friends enjoyed them too btw teachers , we did clear it with the teachers at school first , so no hate mail please ! . 
i have nothing but good service ever since i started ordering from amazon com keep up the good work . 
there is much confusion about tomatoes , and shopping on line in this case adds to the complexity these are not the best tomatoes offered at the time of this writing the strianese are hands down the best my local store sells them i have been using them for fifteen years but they are significantly more expensive and the shipping is brutal no prime shipping with them i use these specific cento when i am not home it all depends on how much your sauce means to you br br but you need to know what you are buying these cento tomatoes are 1 \) san marzano sauce tomatoes 2 \) they are d o p certified 3 \) and this point is often overlooked , they are from the sarnese nocerino they are the second best in terms of absolute flavor bright from proper acid , deep from proper natural salt sugar balance you probably cannot get better tomatoes fresh unless you know a specialty grower , or do it yourself and have no day job cento sells many others , much cheaper , that are not these br br the price per can is good the best deal is if you have amazon prime and get regular shipments i get three large batches per case , enough to feed the mob that forms on sauce day br br most people are happy with the many good canned tomatoes , especially when you look at the poor genetically engineered ersatz fresh tomatoes at the supermarket but if you are a maestro , these are what you want . 
dop san marzano canned tomatoes are the finest canned tomatoes on the planet but i can get these for literally half the price at my local grocery store is this unusual \? boston is pretty heavily italian in some areas maybe that makes a difference i do n't understand why anyone would buy them at this price check your local grocery store before you buy them at this price . 
i discovered these wonderful tomatoes and yes , they are worth paying for unfortunately in my area they are approaching 6 bucks a can and never go on sale walmart has them for about 4 dollars a can , but i prefer not to be tied down to that store the local italian mart advertised san marzano tomatoes , 4 cans for 5 dollars too good to be true \? yes , in fact , these are very ordinary tomatoes i am on the hunt for these wonderful tomatoes at a good price they turn an ordinary recipe into a gourmet experience . 
i received my order with a few problems the majority of the cans arrived dented , some very severely ! amazon needs to add better packing material to keep the cans from moving around in the shipping box , i am surprised they have n't fixed this shipping issue by now because of all the complaints here in the reviews however , amazon is really great when it comes to problems like this with food items they are shipping me a new order , no charge , and i get to keep my original order ! i am hoping my new order arrives in better condition ! these san marzano tomatoes are not dop certified ! even though the description says they are \? many people have complained about this in the reviews so i am surprised amazon is still listing them as dop certified \? however , they are very good quality tomatoes and certified organic i have also noticed the price of this item fluctuates often so here 's a tip place it in your shopping cart and then save it for later , check your cart daily and wait for the price to drop ! i paid 20 79 but i have seen the price as high as 53 00 , so it pays to be patient good luck ! . 
purchased a small case of these tomatoes i used them for pizza sauce and they tasted great the labels looked identical to the picture posted on amazon . 
i love san marzano tomatoes and cento 's are great they have the greatest , sweetest taste ever worth ever penny and than some . 
these tomatoes are perfect for italian recipes full flavor , not too acidic and very italian ! always the best choice for italian cooking . 
most if not all of the cans were dented in some way , however it is a cheaper method of purchasing this product . 
this is a fine product why \? sure , it 's has a flavor that on other tomato has , an earthy taste . 
i have read past reviews where people complained about receiving dented cans with this product i had a previous shipment where all was well , but not this time the shipment came in a badly mangled box , but i thought all would be well when the interior box was pristine i was very surprised to find a badly dented can in an undamaged box this tells me that the can was already dented when packed amazon should reconsider their source for this product the tomatoes are superior but the packing stinks . 
the product is great but it is priced nearly twice what it retails for in local markets i dont mind paying a little for convenience of home delivery , but this is too much . 
this product is indeed fabulous and you can get it at many grocery stores for a lesser price overall a great product and makes awesome red sauce ! to squism i find it very disturbing that you casually refer to hitting your wife , even if you are joking , this is not the place for that sort of behavior ! ! ! ! if you really hit your wife your a punk coward domestic abuse is not a laughing matter and i was personally offended by your review try to maintain some amount of class when posting on here i am sure that is something you are incapable of doing , judging by your disgusting and classless review . 
this formula is a life saver ! our 2 month old had a little viral bug , which made him spit up a lot and be very fussy with this formula , he barely spits up at all and has been so much happier ! br br ask your doctor for a sample ! when we took our baby in for his tummy troubles , the doc gave us a full sized can of this formula to take home and try ! considering it costs about 14 retail , this was great ! br br pros br reduced spit up and gas br reduced fussiness br easy to mix up br br cons br baby ca n't go as long between feedings , probably because it 's easier to digest br br you can also get 2 free cans of similac \( one advance and one sensitive \) by mail if you register at their website great product and great customer service ! . 
good price for product i had started my baby on the similac soy formula but it was too much for my son 's tummy this formula was a welcomed change unfortunately , it came at the funky time of similac 's big recall of all the larger containers \( i was buying the 34oz can from the wholesale store \) and the smaller containers were all sold out of the local stores not a fun situation finding this 6 pack at a reasonable price was a much needed and appreciated rescue ! . 
great formula , our son is not getting stomach pains like with the regular similac and he actually likes the taste the only thing is that it 's way cheaper at costco \( 27 82 per 34oz tax \) amazon is not willing to price match ! ! ! . 
while i have not purchased this from amazon i have used it for many years it makes a super layer for , my version , of zuppa engelesia and mixed with cream can be incorporated for pate choux br i do n't live in hollywood any more so it is getting more difficult and thanks to amazon i find it it available and in larger cans i plan to order soon br br gino rossi br mangia con passione chef caterer . 
although i had some concerns about product with initial shipment my concerns were far overshadowed by the excellent , prompt and courteous response from vendor about my concerns customer service that seems a rarity these days was absolutely exceptional ! will definitely keep this vendor in mind when i have need for other craft supplies products . 
the m m candy machine works just fine but the finger hole is too small for adult fingers to retrieve the candy it does intimidate a m m lover because of the small amount it dispenses . 
i'm on my first jar of this , and am really enjoying what it adds to my concoctions vegetarian one pan mix ups of onions , garlic , vegetables , usually tofu , rice or pasta or quinoa , sometimes olives or capers br i may have purchased it at uwajimaya , when on sale i will be buying many more jars of this mixed spice paste it 's not really a paste more liquid , with easily identifiable basil leaves i highly recommend this chili paste . 
this deal on amazon with the prime free shipping , and or the even cheaper subscription is very tempting if you make a lot of desserts with this like we do one of our favorites is layered graham crackers , this pudding mixed with frozen whipped topping , and topped with a can of melted chocolate frosting lots of stores are discontinuing name brands , so this is a great item to buy here . 
my husband loves pudding and any kind of dessert at the end of dinner this is a great way to appease his cravings while not being full of butter and fat i love that i can add whatever i want to it to fancy it up a little i love to put cocoa powder and make a more elegant tasting chocolate pudding or mix it with berries for my kids . 
like always this label is the best in desserts and this 3 4 ounce vanilla pudding is not the exeption , is easy to make , and vey fast , and the size is the best for a little families the vanilla flavor is fantastic . 
you can substitute nut milk , coconut milk or goat 's milk or even soy milk for the 'milk' in this instant pudding br br if you add coconut cream and toasted coconut you have coconut cream pie pudding ! if you add some raw cocoa powder you have chocolate pudding ! you can add some softened cream cheese and have cheese cake base puddin' ! you are only limited by your imagination this is also excellent as an addition to a cake mix \( about a 1 3 packet and an extra tablespoon of liquid \) . 
i always enjoy jello pudding , however , one package that i recieved was opened , and the powder spilled all over it really alters the price when you only recieve 23 packages instead of the promised 24 . 
my big boy oreo loves this so much i took him off beef products and only give him venison rabbit , turkey he ca n't get enough of this stuff . 
delivered by ups , this product is just about perfect it does not have a disagreeable smell and the dogs love it it is much less expensive than prescription dogfood and our dogs are thriving on it you can even see an occasional pea and or carrot no grain to worry about . 
i have two terrier mixes and they love this product i mix it with their dry grain free dog food and they just gobble it up like no tomorrow i am happy that amazon has this product on subscribe and save it 's one less thing to worry about since i know it 's going to arrive every two months br br when i know i'm going to be out of the house for a long time , i take this product and smear it inside a kong toy oh em gee talk about keeping these add pups occupied for a period of time \) br br like the other buyer said , you occassionally see a piece of carrot or potato here and there i like looking at the ingredients on this product there 's no added water , mechanically separated meat or other by product good job ! . 
bought 1 2 lb each of five different mo 's fudge recently from a school fundraiser i'm not much of a chocolate fudge eater , prefer peanut butter , but the dark chocolate fudge is incredible so rich and creamy ! almost too creamy had to throw it into the fridge to make it easier to cut but if any fudge can turn me into a chocolate fudge lover , this can ! . 
this mild semi soft soft cheese has a range of subtle flavors that i have yet to find elsewhere the price is worth it , though i ca n't afford to order it often , but the combination of this cheese with a really good white wine is truly a culinary delight ! . 
this tea is absolutely incredible ! addicted after first taste so delicious the smell the taste it 's a beautiful experience i just ordered more \( and gonna try both regular and decaf \) . 
i love this tea and drink it at least twice a day the flavor is both strong and sweet the tea stands on it 's own , never needing sweetner if you 're a cinnamon lover , you have to try this tea and even if you 're not , it 's worth a try . 
i am fairly certain this is the same tea sold by caribou coffee i think i could be considered an addict ! the flavor is so good lots of cinnamon and slightly spicy because of it price for 50 is good and less than i have been able to find it elsewhere . 
after having to give up coffee years ago due to a medical condition , i tried many different kinds and favors of tea until i stumbled upon this in a small bakery that had recently opened nearby i loved it and have been drinking it every morning since over the past couple of years the sachets are perfect for a larger mug , the paper wrapped are fine for smaller cups or mugs it 's a hearty tea that i find satisfying and delicious . 
as a person who love cinnamon scent and flavor , i find this tea amazing i was used to drinking the plain black tea at work and this blend is a nice change from that i can probably only have one or two cups a day because it is pretty sweet but i will continue to drink it probably every day enjoy . 
love this tea , its like drinking liquid red hots i hate herbal teas b c they all taste and smell like potpourri but this stuff is awesome ! ! ! ! . 
a co worker gave me a couple of the harney sons fine teas hot cinnamon spice sachets to sample the cinnamon spice flavor is wonderful these teas are not available at my local grocery stores i was glad to find them for a reasonable price on line . 
i love this tea which has a deep cinnamon aroma and taste it 's equally good as an iced tea full marks ! . 
i drink a lot of flavored black teas and this is hands down one of my favorites the scent is enticing and the flavor is bold , and sweet at the same time if you love spice , this is a must have tea . 
super tasty , super delicious best tea ever , sweet and cinnamony i actually like these better than the individually wrapped tea bags . 
this is an excellent tea , very flavorful the cinnamon is fresh and powerful , and overall it 's slightly sweet without needing any sugar excellent with milk or straight . 
this is more than just a tea , drinking a cup is like a beautiful experience it has a multi dimensional flavor , it really does i never considered myself a tea drinker , but i ordered it once at a starbucks and was hooked ever since on special occasions or even when i am down , i treat myself to a cup of this warm and delicous tea . 
it 's that good ! heaven if you like cinnamon tastes sweet with no sugar . 
i was actually surprised at how good these muffins taste ! i have reordered a case and they are gluten free . 
had this sent to me in afghanistan the flavor was enjoyable but not to spicy it is made with quailty ingridents i would surely say this is one of the best salsa 's i 've ever had . 
i love vitamuffins , but my supermarket sells one box of 4 muffins for 6 29 instead i bought the mix , 3 boxes for 16 00 , and each box makes 12 muffins instead of 1 62 per muffin , the mix only requires water eggs and works out to about 48 cents per muffin , and very easy to make that 's a great deal . 
i buy these through the ship and save program because they are a staple of my breakfast and midday snack routine br light , flavorful , and full of vitamins , these only take 20 25 minutes to bake with minimal extras i am vegan so i use egg substitutes \( 3 tbsps flax seed in place of the eggs with 9 tbs water \) and they still bake perfectly . 
better then i expected i notice there was some complaints that the muffins were dry br so i sprayed the mix before cooking with a butter flavored publix spray which is canola oil same as pam butter spray br this did the trick they were great . 
i generally like vitalicious products the corn muffin , well , for 100 calories it 's not bad but if you are expecting anything like the sugar fat laden junk that your local bakery sells , look elsewhere this is like a healthy makeover that does n't quite cut it , but they 're not bad for the same amount of calories , the chocolate one is more of an indulgence , but this one is good for a bland breakfast treat , especially baked fresh br my kids are happy to get any extra snacks , so they approve i send with them to school for a midmorning snack im glad they get fuel and vitamins . 
i like loose tea , i just do n't like chewing on leaves in my tea cup , or having to dispose of a bunch of loose , soggy leaves that seem to find every corner of my kitchen however , i'm spoiled rotten and only like the flavor that comes with brewing loose tea so i 've been using these empty tea bags in order to make loose tea a lot less messy and just as convenient as bagged tea most bags of this type i 've encountered are made in europe and come with a price to match , and a single pack of 100 does n't last a whole long time when i saw this deal here on amazon , i went for it br br the bags look and work identically to the european made ones , although i believe these are made in india \( where they know a whole lot about making tea \) but the price is about 2 3 less than that of the european made ones i ca n't argue with that \( well , i could argue with that , but i'm not a dope \) that way , we can have the best tea on the market , which is sold loose , without the pain in the neck features of brewing loose tea with a tea ball or strainer just throw in the right amount of tea , tuck the top flap into the bag , and that 's it you now have a teabag of your favorite kenyan black tea \( or whatever makes you happy \) throw away the neat little soggy bag when you 're done no mess at all br br i 've decided to get these on as a subscription , with a 6 pack arriving twice a year that way , my family can have three cups or pots of tea each day \( this size works for both \) , and maybe a few more on the weekend before running out we 've been using these bags for several months now , and are still as happy with them as we were when they arrived if amazon keeps offering these bags , i am sure we 'll keep buying them ! . 
i like loose tea and hate having to clean out the metal holders these bags are ideal as they let me make a pot or just a cup of tea and then throw it in the compost pile to be reused for my garden . 
my scottish terrier inhaled hers in about 2 hours , but my finicky pomeranian , who usually turns his nose up at chew toys , loved it ! it kept my pom busy for a few weeks , but he really enjoyed it ! br br affordable price , fast shopping , great product ! . 
i love this frosting ! it 's sugar free and i cannot find it in stores i will be ordering more in the future . 
awesome little snack treat for your favorite pup dog my two pekeingese just love these you can use them for training as well as just a treat they come in a variety of flavors my pups like the liver the best for senior dogs , these are perfect if they do n't have the jaw power or teeth use anymore they are easy to carry so you can treat your dog whenever you want to for example on a walk around the neighborhood they are just 3 calories each so you do n't have to worry about their weight absolutely recommend these to every dog owner ! . 
these are a hit with my pups , and for the price and 3 calories a piece , they ca n't be beat ! they 're great for training in addition to putting them into food puzzle toys to keep them occupied i also provide a steady supply of these to my youngest pup during nail clipping as he has quite a bit of anxiety and these treats totally take his mind off of the scary clipper at his toes br br first ingredient is wheat flour , so if your dog happens to be allergic to wheat these wo n't work for you my dogs are n't allergic , nor do these treats give tummy problems , so i'm happy ! ingredient list is short , that 's another plus , it 's not a long list of artificial this and that br br i give my pups both the liver flavor and the cheese egg flavor to mix things up a bit the cheese egg ones even smell like cheese , yum ! . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b0002z9bf8 all natural dog treats by charlee bear cheese egg 16 oz resealable bag a these are absolutely great treats for training and for use with overweight dogs at only 4 calories per treat , even an overweight dog can feel like they are getting treats too , especially in a multi dog household where one dog is overweight , others are not taste must be wonderful since there is n't anything my dogs wo n't do for these tiny treats , so i'm very pleased with them for many reasons ! great products ! ! ! . 
my dog 's breeder sent home a baggie of cheese and egg flavored charlie bears for my maltese puppy i used them to reward him from the get go , and he will do just about anything if he knows this treat is coming a great training aid they are also small enough to give often , and are made with good ingredients i carry them in my pocket and my little guy keeps an eye on that pocket ! . 
i love these treats for my two german shepherds i think these treats are great for even large size dogs my dogs absolutely go crazy for them , and they are only 3 calories per treat , perfect for training sessions i also love the texture of them you can put them in your pocket without a ton of flaking or gross smell this product also has a simplified ingredient list opposed to so many other dog treats out there you can pronounce all the ingredients in the list and you know what they are getting . 
charlee bears are small and low calorie , so you can use them en masse for training we use them both for standard training \( sit , stay , drop it , leave it \) and behavioral training \( no bark \) they 're not stinky or messy , so you can put them in your pocket , purse , or car without worry we keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy does n't bark at people walking by , one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside , and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel br br the one downside to these is that because they 're not as stinky , it can be harder to use them to get your dog 's attention if he or she is distracted , like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these , and they 'll take on some of the scent \( we use a href http www amazon com gp product b0002dgrsy pro treat beef liver , freeze dried dog treats , 21 ounce a \) br br our dog loves all flavors . 
i am a middle aged runner and take this cherry concentrate to help my recovery time between long races this works better than ibuprofen and is all natural after each long run i take a couple tablespoons with my gatorade and my muscles recover quicker \( i experimented with not taking it \) i love this stuff . 
juice consentrate is very good i like it as much as the tart is smart and with the price increase it is considerably cheaper even with subscribe and save this will be my staple tart cherry juice from now on . 
i have read a couple of the studies on the anti inflammatory potential of tart cherry juice , and became convinced that it 's worth a try \( as a 57 yo athlete \) i like this product b c the label tells exactly how many cherries a tablespoon is equivalent to , so i can make an informed choices as to how much i use , based on the number of cherry equivalents in the studies i 've read i ca n't vouch for the accuracy of the label , but i 've no reason to doubt it i 've grown to like the flavor , especially mixed with lime seltzer ! . 
i am training for a half marathon at the start of my training i was n't taking cherry juice as i increased my long runs each week my knees and hips were so sore i started to take this cherry concentrate and ever since then i have felt pretty good i take the juice every morning with my breakfast it has a very strong flavor but mixes well with apple or orange juice the half marathon i'm running in is this weekend and i feel ready for it thanks in part to the cherry juice helping reduce the pain this stuff works for me . 
i have pain and numbness down both arms from a pinched nerve at the bottom of my neck i started drinking this juice three months into what will likely be a four to six month recovery because my doctor has put me on a long term anti inflammatory medication , i am not allowed to take over the counter medications like advil and tylenol i can say that taking a glass of this juice has the same pain killing effect as taking two advil i enjoy two glasses a day one in the morning and one at dinner the only down side is the sugar , which is really the only processed sugar i eat during the day the juice tastes good and the quality of the syrup is consistent and pleasant br br i usually do n't go for miracle foods or diet fads , but this juice simply works this is the real deal it will not cure pain , but it will inhibit inflammation and facilitate faster healing of arthritis , spasms , and sprains . 
this juice is actually concentrated as advertised of all the juice concentrates of any flavor i have tried , this one is the most concentrated , and i expected the others to be as concentrated but they were all thin i guess tart cherry juice tastes like fresh black cherries in general , but montmorency rtcj has the more tart best flavor ! . 
tastes like drinking a cherry pie i purchased this for my mother 's gout and she told me it works quickly it 's also supposed to help lower blood pressure speedy delivery it 's not 5 stars because of the high price . 
every bit as good as any other brand i 've tried fantastic taste and easy to use this stuff can become addictive . 
i am a long distance runner and a belly dancer my back objects to the dancing and my knees object to the running i was having a lot of trouble managing my pain and still doing my activities with ibuprofen alone i read about tart cherry juice in my running magazine , and i decided to give it a try after reading some of the other reviews here on amazon br br i am simply blown away by the difference ! my body really reacts to this stuff my knee pain has disappeared , and my back only hurts during really deep back bends i had same day relief , too i can definitely tell the difference on days where i forget to take this ! as an added bonus , i have noted a marked decrease in how sore my muscles are , as well i wish i had heard about this sooner ! br br i follow what it says on the bottle , 1 once twice daily at first , i was just using a tablespoon and licking it out of the tablespoon \( 2tbs 1 oz \) , which i still do in the mornings , but good lord this stuff is tart ! the first one is n't too bad , i think mostly because your taste buds are in shock the second one really gets me , though ! lately , i 've been mixing my ounce into a cup of orange juice at dinner , which looks disgusting but tastes , surprisingly , really good br br i really hope this product comes back in stock soon , i do n't think i could go without it and i'm hesitant to switch to a different brand . 
good , and reasonable for drink a product that is good for sleeping and inflamation i will buy again if the price stays reasonable . 
this cherry juice concentrate taste very cherry \) a href http www amazon com gp product b0032jkwgi country spoon montmorency red tart cherry juice concentrate 34 oz a i like this product , and , perhaps , i will order this cherry juice concentrate again . 
this is very good but i prefer the liquid cherry juice less messy to deal with and the concentrate does n't seem to go as far as the liquid juice just my preference . 
i have managed to find these crackers in other countries on our travels but had run out i love that they are individually wrapped small packets in a stay fresh container this makes them great to carry in my purse , take to work or on airplanes for snacks etc also love that they are not overly salted like so many american brand crackers company that shipped them did a great job fast too ! . 
this is the best tasting cracker i 've ever tasted it may cost less in a filipino or asian store which is all well and good unless you do n't live close to one \( i do n't \) note that the box says 1 pound 14 ounces but the description on this page says 28z \( whatever a z is \) if they meant oz , it 's incorrect it 's a 30oz box in any case , i was able to find it even cheaper online than the price shown on this page where \? amazon \( grin \) whenever you buy stuff like this , be sure to consider the bottom line price \( product plus shipping \) and check for alternative amazon pages where it 's cheaper on this page , it 's 15 78 for a 30oz box with free shipping \( if you total order is 25 or more \) but on this page br br a href http www amazon com gp product b0066d2xvy sky flakes crackers 1x850g a br br the same 30oz box costs only 9 00 5 49 shipping or 14 49 total , over a dollar cheaper than on this page so , buy from amazon but not from this page . 
this product is a quick snack very light and tasteful with any spread or just like it is takes up hardly ay space if a couple of packets are placed in your bag individually wrapped crackers makes it stay fresh for longer periods . 
if you like sweetarts and you want them in a bulk amount , this product is for you the sweetarts came perfectly sealed and in excellent condition there are no downsides . 
sweetarts evokes nostalgic memories of going into the candy store and pining for that sweet and sour chalky taste of this classic candy while it 's a hard candy it is easily chewable and has pleasant texture and taste you really ca n't go wrong with this candy the only drawback is it is hard to stop at just one and before you know it you 've eaten an entire roll . 
i have ordered these a couple times now they arrive super fresh and sealed every time i used to buy a roll a day from the gas station , now i have a stash at home that is available anytime yumm . 
i 've purchased bulk candies where they are old , terrible flavors , or simply smashed to dust this was a great buy , having none of those drawbacks . 
i used these for my sons bday party as one of the sweet treats to have out they are great , the kids all loved them and the price was fabulous , way better than purchasing elsewhere the item came as described and was fresh thank you amazon com . 
it is very very good sweets br amazon always is excellent br amazon always is excellent br amazon always is excellent br amazon always is excellent . 
excellent shipment and product as well , looking forward to purchase again , thanks br excellent shipment and product as well , looking forward to purchase again , thanks br excellent shipment and product as well , looking forward to purchase again , thanks . 
my family has been in love with baci 's ever since we lived in europe when my daughters were small they coined the term baci pill for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well they are a wonderful treat , after a meal with espresso or cappuccino pop the entire baci in your mouth and experience the famous perugina chocolate and then the still crunchy hazelnut center the italians do everything with class and this beats a hershey 's kiss any day ! .

just returned from italy and was told these little chocolates were the favs of the italians perfect little two chocolates for gifts and gloomy days or happy days . 
delicious candy br outstanding price for such a rich product br the fortunes on the inside are an added bonus br great options relating to packaging . 
my dog had been prone to ear infections and did a lot of paw chewing when his vet recommended changing his diet because his symptoms may be due to a food allergy she specifically recommended the salmon and rice formula unfortunately , my dog hated the salmon and rice and it smelt extremely fishy i tried the lamb and rice formula and he likes it much better i 've heard numerous good things about wellness from my dog trainer , as well as other pet owners and pet store employees my dog is adjusting to the new food well however , i can tell he does n't consider it the most tasty of choices probably because it does n't have the artificial flavoring in it but i 'd rather him eat something much healthier even if we have to sacrifice a little on the taste . 
i got this food for my dog that is allergic to corn , wheat , potatoes , flax , fish , and pork i had the hardest time finding a food that he was n't allergic to i'm so glad i found this food he is finally eating and starting to put on some weight it is a little pricey but i think it is worth it for such a good product . 
instead of simple solution lamb rice i was sent simple lamb oatmeal but , my dog likes it next time i will make sure i am sent the right food i did n't know until i had open and put the food in my 10lb container . 
if your dog eats slowly actually chews his food , then this food is fantastic ! we have 2 dogs , 1 that is a picky eater , so we added water and microwave his food for 30 sec he loves his dinner keeps it down \( full disclosure , he 's not the dog with stomach problems our boston terrier , who we adopted from a puppy mill situation , eats by gulping down her food , from her years when she had to fight for food she is the dog we were targeting by getting sensitive stomach food she was having a problem with vomiting regurgitation the good news is , if we get her to eat 2 3 small meals a day and try to get her to slow down , problem solved yet , if she eats fastly , without chewing , regurgitation is still a problem br br i gave the food 4 stars because if we do make sure she chews it \( by feeding her a couple morsels at a time , like giving treats \) the food stays down , therefore working for vomiting , which was a huge proplem ! \( she was vomiting 6 9 times a day \) since switching she has stopped vomiting i do n't think our dog is the only one that eats fast , and it does take much longer to feed her . 
my dogs love this natural kibble it 's simple \( only rice and protein \) yet tasty they maintain a healthy weight and have regular and healthy bowl movements wellness is a fantastic product for dogs because they keep in mind the many ingredients that are not natural to a dog 's diet and keep it out of their food . 
i have a dog with severe allergies we have been fighting for years the vets always recommend mass produced allergy formulas like science diet i ca n't stomach feeding my dog that type of garbage but simple is a good alternative , made with quality ingredients and the dogs love it too great product ! ! . 
before my oldest golden started eating this food he got a lot of ear infections he ate grain free food , but he still got them both my dogs like this food and their coats are nice and shiny and their ears are super clean i really recommend it br br while you can get it for 1 cheaper on other sites , you pay 18 for shipping br br i only wish amazon had more than 3 bags of it each time ! . 
quality food but the price is very high luv amazon 's free ship over 25 . 
i was so excited to get my whole wheat pizza dough after ordering it , i got it two days later ! the directions are easy to follow and the taste of the crust is phenomenal the toppings i added to my pizza were shrimp , chicken , cherry tomatoes , mexican cheese blend , and turkey canadian bacon the pizza turned out great ! only 8 weight watcher 's point plus value per slice this is a better alternative to other leading pizzas . 
my husband does not like whole wheat anything but he liked this pizza dough it was very simple to make and spread on our pizza stone we put rossi pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese on and it was great ! . 
great stuff ! love that it 's organic and raw but later saw same thing tj 's for less than half the price ! . 
i love this organic raw honey ! br br when using it in my tea i do n't need a lot and the taste is great br br honey is also helpful with moisturizing and healing so other than consuming it i also use it on my hair and face often the darker the better . 
i absolutly love these candies that are only put on the market at christmas and valentine 's day i would buy them all year if they were available so you can imagine how excited i was tao be able to get them for a while through amazon i can wait untill christmas when they will be available again . 
cant find this flavor in the stores , so bought them here online like them so much better than the peppermint ones i also like the cinnamon ones yum o \( as rachel ray states \) . 
the local merchants quit stocking this was pleased to buy this on line so i can make french canadian pea soup again 5 stars for ability to obtain since quality is not that much of a factor all of bob 's red mill products are 5 star . 
its hard to find this stuff locally usually my parents have to bring it to me when they visit was pleased to find it on amazon br br makes great , tasty dhall we eat a lot of it , so its nice to know i can get it here again when i need it . 
bought these for a change from the green split peas they are tasty and i like them will buy again always like bob 's red mill products . 
full bodied tea , no loss of flavor even though it is decaffeinated comes stored in its own heavy duty zipper plastic bag to ensure freshness during shipping a great value for a good tea . 
with the departure of starbucks coffees , i reluctantly switched back to the other t discs carried by local stores i tried , i really did but , it seemed like every other one i tried , which was basically every other one made , including the european t discs , were not rich enough to satisfy me i finally gave up and went back to an old fashioned drip coffeemaker so that i could make a nice , rich cup i was still frustrated by the waste , since i'm the only coffee drinker in my home plus , being a basically lazy person , i did n't enjoy filling the reservoir every time i wanted to brew a pot , washing the pot out afterwards , or cleaning out the grounds from the filter recently , tassimo gevalia came out with a dark house blend the front of the package noted new ! if you like starbucks house blend , try this ! as a last shot attempt before packing up my tassimo for storage , i purchased this new t disc coffee tasting my first sip , i was so happy really really happy ! my coffee is so important to me , and the gevalia dark house blend is amazing ! ! ! ! it 's a rich , full bodied cup of coffee , and as i drink this day after day , i'm starting to think it 's even better than my old favorite starbucks flavors it 's as bold as starbucks with no bitterness at all i 'd love to hear what others think of this i am very pleased with it , and i'm so glad that i am able to go back to the simplicity of using my tassimo brewer , because they make a great t disc again ! . 
this is the best thing from gevalia i was drinking the starbucks africa and verona before the breakup i tried the dark breakfast from gevalia , but it 's horrible i can only drink it after adding the maestro lorenzo espresso intensivo that makes quite a nice cup with a good kick to it i even need a little cream in it to smooth it out a bit br br but this one is just right it 's a nice strong cup that does n't need cream , but can take cream without losing flavor this is the first hope i have had for saving my tassimo machine i do n't want to go back to the keurig br br p s i would still like a good decaf option right now i use the gevalia signature decaf and add a shot of gevalia decaf espresso to jazz it up . 
i 've tried all three new 'dark' offerings from gevalia and i think this is the best one from the three gevalia finally came up with coffee worth serving to your guests br coffee has an earthy bold taste with little to none bitterness and no metallic after taste it actually leaves a nice smooth tasty chocolaty after taste br br the pack comes with 12 big t discs that will brew 8 ounces of coffee this coffee will delight those who love the darker roasts br br update br i am on my 5th cup of this coffee and it was really grown on me \( changing from a 4 to 5 stars \) it is quite tasty and smooth this is one coffee that will truly satisfy the void that sbux left there will be some that will say that this is not the same as sbux and it is n't ! try the coffee and give it a fair taste without trying to compare it to anything else you may find yourself quite surprised at the findings highly recommended and definitely will be buying this one again . 
finally some new varieties of tassimo i drink everything from dd to starbucks to nespresso to good blends from fairway this one is pretty much right on with the description dark brew good medium body it has a strong flavor but is smooth and no aftertaste at all , reminiscent of how sbux does brew their beans \( but i like this better than the sbux house coffee it 's not quite as edgy \) , and is unlike many of the other gevalia coffees for tassimo that i just do n't like b c of their aftertaste \( bitter , to me \) this one brews at 190 degrees \( at least mine did \) , which is a bit hotter than i would make a cup of latte for example \( at 160 \) so be careful on that first sip ! but i do think this one 's a keeper . 
together with many customers , i was frustrated when tassimo and starbucks ended their relationship my coffee was verona br since that time , i have tried various alternatives \( gevalia espresso , tassimo carte noir , tassimo nabob kenco med roast \) but with limited and varying degrees of success br after reading a previous review , i sent off for a supply to test it i love it ! ! ! ! br br i was on the point of giving my tassimo machine away no more br br a great start to the new year . 
i recently got a tassimo machine and really like it , but the initial coffees that i tried were not as good as what i used to make by the pot this one finally blew everything else away it 's delicious the dark house blend is now my preferred t disc when i want coffee since i'm not a coffee snob i do n't like to get crazy with the adjectives , but this one has a very deep and pleasing coffee flavor full bodied is a good way to describe it , as opposed to a lesser bodied coffee that may smell good but tastes watered down when you drink it this is definitely the best coffee i 've ever tasted out of a home brewing machine and even better than many cafes can muster it has no aftertaste and it is not bitter you can drink it black with no sweetener and enjoy it , or add some cream even if you go heavy on the creamer it does n't lose is flavor buy it , and ignore the starbucks haters seriously , starbucks' coffees are not as good as everyone makes them out to be dunkin donuts coffee has them beat in price and quality . 
i love this coffee , its dark but not bitter and smooth as silk its a big cup size 12oz so its great in the morning when i do n't want to get up for coffee too much if you have a tassimo you should have this coffee blend on hand ! . 
it tastes pretty decent but i was n't aware how pricy they were when i bought them i paid 17 44 for a pack of 12 ! ! ! what a rip off ! . 
i loved the quality and the taste of these cookies they are not too sweet and they will live to your expectations to the person that posted a bad review , just a small comment they are called meltaways because they have real butter , go figure if you are interested in low fat food , look elsewhere it like complaining that french fries are fried , or that chocolate is fattening just saying . 
these were so , so good , and i love that they 're made with whole wheat flour and a healthier sugar substitute \( not aspartame or splenda \) i looked at some atkins peanut butter cups i 'd just bought , and they 're a higher percentage of saturated fat than these cookies i worry a lot more about the sugar in a product than the fat , unless it 's made with soybean oil or lists trans fat i list this as one of my healthy snacks and since i'm over 40 , size 4 , with no health problems i must be on the right track of what healthy is \) br br one customer said hers were greasy maybe hers were in the heat , and the butter got hot \? i'm now placing my third order for these they 're worth it ! . 
my husband is gluten sensitive , dairy sensitive , and diabetic , so it is very difficult to find desserts for him usually , if it 's gluten free , it has waaaay too much sugar , for example i tried a box of these cookies for him he tried them and said that they are surprisingly good br br they are not mereingues , even though they are shaped like those types of cookies they are regular cookie consistency there are just a few in a package , so they are rather expensive however , they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail \( can you tell i have made some bombs in my time as a specialty cook \? lol \) . 
i was looking for some nutritious snacks with fiber and came across these i 've tried this variety and the oatmeal flax ones and both are very good they have a dryish texture but are full of flavor would n't say they 're like home baked , but there is no artificial taste at all they 're generous in size \( 3 4 inches diameter , almost an inch high \) and though not calorie lightweights \( 120 140 each depending on the variety \) , they have 3 4 grams of fiber each highly recommend these for healthy snacking or even a quick breakfast . 
after years of brandy soaked twinkies , i just tried one of these tonight wow ! these are good my wife was right they 're good but not so good you go crazy and eat the entire box it may be the whopping 3 grams of fiber in these tiny little things i think it 's actually my stomach screaming , no more ! i can't take any more fiber ! i'm gonna blow ! br br they remind me of the homemade wholegrain hippy eucharist from the late 70 's and early 80 's heavy , moist , whole grain goodness takes me back to my catholic school days they used to let us kids eat all the leftover homemade wholegrain hippy jesus after a mass good times . 
whole grain ingredients and good tasting most kashi products have mostly white flour with very little whole grains , but these cookies are primarily a whole grain mix it 's nice to have a treat that is more nutritious and still sweet enough for my sweet tooth ! there are several varieties of kashi cookies , and they are all good . 
yes , these are wonderful and healthy cookies , but this is a rare bad deal from amazon \( really dab nutrition \) they are charging about 25 \( including shipping \) in less than a minute of web searching i found the same quantity for about 15 shipped enjoy the cookies , but buy from someone else until the price comes down . 
yummy good flavor i wish they were softer and not so crumbly and for some odd reason they give me heartburn , and i never get heartburn i still like the flavor . 
span class tiny length 1 00 mins br br span these cookies are so great ! watch our video to see how great they really are ! ! ! . 
these were shipped out the day after i ordered them and arrived within 5 days \( i live on the opposite coast where these are made \) my order arrived nicely packaged for the price , i got 1 lbs 4 oz of biscotti \( i weighed it on my kitchen scale \) cut into 10 big pieces add the shipping and handling , and that comes out to a little more than 2 per piece this is approximately what my local bakery charges per biscotti too \( when they have some \) so , i guess this is the going price for homemade biscotti these days \? br br the flavor is very almondy and , the hardness is just perfect the biscotti is hard and crunchy , but it 's not so hard that you could n't eat it without dunking \( as some biscotti are \) this biscotti can be eaten as is or can be dunked in coffee , tea or cocoa i dunked mine in chai tea and it tastes great and , the biscotti does not fall apart when dunked br br i like the almond flavor , but i wish this came in anise flavor that 's my favorite biscotti flavor . 
this coffee has a smooth , carmely , dark finish that i love ! my husband gets other dark blends that taste like charcoal to me this one is very smooth , with just a hint of sweetness i wish that amazon had it on its monthly purchase program , would love to save 15 on it ! however , i was glad to find it someplace besides green mountain as prime members , we can get our coffee replaced in 2 shipping days v a week or longer over at gm sweet ! . 
this is the fifth different type of coffee i 've tried with my keurig coffee maker right now , it is tied with a newman 's own k cup as my favorite a couple k cup products seemed fine when i first tasted them , but have come to pale somewhat in comparison with other flavors and makes br br this is a really smooooooooooooooooooth tasting coffee it does not have a strong taste , but goes down very easily there is a richness to the taste as well br br bottom line \? i will be purchasing this again when my supply runs out as i continue experimenting with different flavor k cups . 
great coffee rich , robust a coffee lovers choice if you like french roast or italian roast , you will like this coffee . 
i am a coffee snob yes , i admit it i prefer fresh roasted kenyan coffee , but also like sumatran , jamacan , guatamalan , even etheopian i generally say that i do n't drink columbian most k cups are weak and less than stellar , though i have found several i enjoy i was surprised by caribou 's mahogany ! it is excellent strong enough with an earthy , winey taste and smoothe finish \( my description \) i eagerly tried their daybreak , to my disappointment just ordinary i do n't often write reviews , but if this can get someone else to enjoy mahogany it is well worth the time if you have similar taste in coffee give it a try ! ! \( and no , i do n't work for them \) . 
i love this coffee very dark but not at all bitter i finally found one i like as much as jet fuel . 
my husband loves strong caribou coffee but i like the milder one or breakfast br type i will drink this but caribou of all kinds is a great coffee , no matter br how strong it will not disappoint . 
this morning , for the first time in my life , i tried mahogani caribou coffee only because i had run out of my usual type of coffee , which i would usually brew and drink in short , i should not even categorize mahogany caribou as coffee ! ! ! ! you know why \? it has far more anti depressant and uplifting effect on me than i had previously anticipated from now on , i will only drink mahogany caribou . 
you can taste the wood in the respect it taste like the coffee was roasted over wood it is very smooth , i detect no bitterness or over roasting nice flavor my newest favorite amoung the k cup line my old favorite was donut shop but not any more i am not as pleased with the other caribou flavors but this one really surprised me . 
most caribou coffees are too weak for me this one is a delicious exception it 's right up there with revv , emeril 's bold , or van houtte 's eclipse a dark bold coffee without tasting burned or bitter . 
caribou 's mahogany is my favorite k cup coffee it 's got a great , rich taste it 's dark , but not bitter . 
it has a nice strong flavor with no bitterness br br how strong is it \? i would say it is similar in strength to auto drip using 1 rounded tablespoon of coffee per 8oz of water . 
i 've been drinking green mountain 's dark magic and really enjoyed it , however i wanted a change after some searching i discovered this coffee and am glad i did it 's got an excellent deep flavor that i really enjoy strong enough yet not overpowering i recommend you give it a try . 
i agree with the other positive reviews i see here nice flavor , strong ish , no bitter , grind y or conference coffee flavors to mess it up br br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano br br my favorite k cups are br starbucks french roast br starbucks caffe verona br starbucks pike place roast br green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve br green mountain double black diamond br green mountain revv br green mountain dark magic br br other k cups i 've tried coffee people jet fuel , green mountain dark magic decaf , emeril jazzed up decaf , starbucks caffe verona , coffee people black tiger , starbucks house blend , starbucks breakfast blend , starbucks sumatra , wolfgang puck french roast , green mountain lake and lodge , green mountain french roast , caribou mahogony , wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya , emeril big easy bold . 
this coffee has a good flavor and a good strength at first it seemed strong but then i got use to it i recommend this flavor coffee good wake up in the morning . 
very nice , smooth cup of coffee caribou coffee has been a favorite of mine since the first time i visited minnesota and had the opportunity to go to a store and have coffee i have since done mail order for their coffee and after purchasing a keurig coffee machine was happy to see it was available in k cups i also enjoy the caribou blend but i have to say this blend has a little more kick to it but still a smooth coffee with no after taste . 
i had n't tried caribou brand k cups before and am extremely picky i like a rich , intense , well bodied coffee and this product delivered strong but no bitter taste , when brewed with 6 oz water i would recommend this product to anyone with similar tastes and will definitely buy it again . 
this is one of my favorites it 's smooth and rich and not too strong for morning but also bold enough that if i like a cup in the afternoon it will do for that too my only problem is that i can never find it locally i almost always have to get it online which is usually more expensive i 've tried the obsidian as a substitute and i do n't like that one quite as much as the mahogany . 
this is probably my favorite k cup so far i'm no professional taster so talk of flavor notes in coffee or elsewhere usually leaves me scratching my head and thinking , if you say so but at my first sip of this dark , smooth coffee , i though chocolate it 's not flavored or sweet but , for me , it has a note of good , dark chocolate highly recommended if you like your coffee strong and full of flavor . 
very smooth rich flavor even on the largest setting , dark blend a very satisfying cup of coffee i will recommend this to my friends this product arrived on time well packaged . 
obviously taste is an opinion but in my humble opinion this is the best coffee out there for keurig and i have tried a billion i love dark roast but starbucks' french roast , sumatra , and others i ca n't remember off hand seem to taste stale to me or not as bold ca n't stand any of caribou 's other dark roasts , such as obsidian which you can get at target sometimes all in all , i am hoping this one sticks around , ange 's personal fav . 
smooth full of flavor not bitter no nasty aftertaste people that like newmans extra bold , starbucks verona and sumatra , tullys french roast and other dark cup should love this it 's better ! . 
although i 've only been able to try three of caribou 's k cup blends \( mahogany as well as a href http www amazon com gp product b00474or8g caribou coffee , caribou blend , k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers , 24 count a and a href http www amazon com gp product b00474vpli caribou coffee , daybreak morning blend , k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers , 24 count a \) , i 've found that caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups they are head and shoulders above their competitors like green mountain and van houtte br br i should mention that caribou 's daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so i 've been able to sample so far but i enjoy a flavorful medium roast my boyfriend , on the other hand , prefers an extra bold dark roast after our favorable experience with the caribou brand before , we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend br br let me just say that mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor it 's quite strong and dark , but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts this coffee packs a powerful punch although that is n't normally my thing , i can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener my boyfriend adores it , though , and it has become a staple blend for him i will still drink this on occasion , but it 's a bit too potent for me br br i think this is the best dark roast i 've had the chance to try . 
nice bold taste but with a little packaged overtone like other k cup products this is just a shade below fresh . 
got this in a k cup sampler , the best k cup so far if you like good strong coffee with a lot of flavor , slight hint of cocoa , this is it no bitter after taste this one goes on top of my reorder list , perfect for the k cup system the one reviewer on this post that gave it one star has no taste buds . 
my wife and i are avid keurig coffee fans \( with three brewers between the two of us \) we started out ordering all the flavored pods and soon learned than are likes were back to the basics we each have a couple of full strength and then go to the de caf for that last cup br br mahogany is my choice for the full blend it 's smooth has an excellent taste and aroma br br we are totally satisfied with this order . 
the name of this coffee is mahogany , in my mind a deep rich brown the coffee flavor is deep and rich , and the color is dark brown it is delicious . 
i ordered the mahogany caribou coffee k cups and adore them i recommend this product if you like bold coffe with a smooth taste . 
this is a serious cup of joe yummyness ! br i have turned at least 3 friends onto this coffee br robust and aeromatic . 
this is maybe the greatest coffee ever made i have had this many time before in regular bean that i grind myself , but never in k cups tastes the exact same and its maybe my favorite coffee ever . 
i like the taste of this coffee tried the other brands but got stuck on this one , i also like the eco friendliness of the company . 
this is the best caribou kcup if you like a dark , hearty roast with good flavor and little acidity will definitely buy again . 
i have been drinking tully 's kona for the past 2 years , but with the price increase of kona , i needed to find something less expensive after trying numerous kcups , this mahogany is just as good as the kona , with a full coffee flavor , and a hint of caramel i am happily converted . 
i enjoyed this because of the full taste i get out of it without it being too bold or having a burnt taste to me it is a bit above the medium blend i do take creamer with my coffee so the boldness may be tamed down i will definitely order more of this when i'm am out . 
i could get very used to this ! this is a nice , strong , robust coffee without bitterness the k cups are so convenient and make no mess . 
i really enjoy this coffee i have used a variety of the k cups and this is one of the best . 
strong smooth velvety flavor mahogany describes the color and the mood you get when drinking absolutely the best i 've found my favorite . 
of all the coffees i 've tried and i 've tried a bunch this is hands down my favorite great bold taste but no bitter aftertaste i drink coffee all day , and i like it strong and fresh it can be difficult to find a stronger tasting coffee that 's really great without cream or sugar , i drink my coffee black i 've not yet found anything i like better yum . 
if you 're a fan of full bodied coffees , give this one a shot br br for my taste , the vast majority of k cups are too watery and weak \( even on the small cup setting \) , so i gravitate towards the extra bold varieties i had previously been enjoying newman 's own extra bold and gm dark magic after reading some favorable comparisons between those and mahogany , i decided to give it a chance br br i find that it 's slightly less bitter \( not that bitter is bad \) than newman 's eb or dark magic , and a little smoother i also think it 's more full bodied without any burned bean flavor i 've tried the mahogany on the larger cup setting and actually still liked it something i 've never said before . 
i 've sampled many different k cup coffe types i prefer a really robust coffee and carbou mahogany really dos n't provide that i would cassify it as medium roast coffee with a smooth melow taste if that is what u are after , then give this blend a try . 
no bitterness a strong , full bodied , cup but does not taste like ashes smooth , very drinkable if you like bold , dark coffee , this will please . 
in my office , and for me personally , this is the smoothest and best tasting coffee you can buy for your keurig machine great price too ! . 
i have tried about every k cup brand caribou mohogany is my all time go to brand flavorful yet not strong and no jitters you get the same great flavor whether you make a small cup or a large one . 
if you like a bold cup of good coffee and have a keurig single up brewer , this is the flavor to buy ! never dissappointing with carbou mahogany ! . 
i have this strong flavorful mahogany coffee by caribou in my keurig i love the taste i do like strong coffee and this seems to be the right blend of strong to medium i use a vanilla diet supplement in the coffee every morning with a splash of torani sugar free syrup and there is breakfast on the move a href http www amazon com gp product b00474vpy0 caribou coffee , mahogany , k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers , 24 count a . 
we love this coffee it is the best k cup we 've found we like strong coffee and struggled at first to find one that we enjoyed the prices on amazon ca n't be beat and the shipping super fast . 
my husband enjoyed this coffee we usually use newman 's extra bold but thought we br would try something different it was a bit too strong for me i prefer newman 's but it was br still good . 
i like strong coffee , but i do n't want it to taste burnt or have an acidic after taste caribou coffee 's mahogany is full bodied with a nice balance of dark notes and acidity it 's one of my go to coffees when my favorites like coffee people 's wake up call are out of stock . 
i like my coffee strong this is the first brand that i have tasted that provides the kick i need without the bitterness i keep my pantry stocked with mahogony and i do not share ! . 
love to order my coffee on amazon easy and shows up quickly br this k cup is great coffee dcaf is very good as well . 
one of the richer coffee for k cups ! we typically grind our own even for the keurig but the mahagoney from caribou is a great alternative order was shipped very quickly will definitely buy again . 
this is my favorite k cup coffee \( i 've tried about twenty different types \) and , so far , everyone i 've served it to really likes it a lot even the pickiest coffee connoisseur i know thought this k cup made an excellent cup of coffee two non coffee drinking friends wish they liked coffee because they love the sound of caribou mahogany . 
this is a great coffee its dark but not bitter , a little chocolaty , and it reminds me of an adirondack lodge i can get them for a better price in a caribou coffee store , however . 
i 've tried quite a few coffees and many end up tasting the same however , this and the italian blend by timothy 's are two that are very good black or with cream sugar if you 're looking for a simple coffee without all the flavors , this is the one for you . 
i 've tried over a dozen varieties of k cups and this is , by far , my favorite ! it 's strong but not bitter and just has a great flavor this will be my choice from now on . 
without beating it to death if you like a full bodied , but mellow brew this might be for you it is hearty , but not at all bitter it holds a nice full body , even when the keurig is set to the oversize setting it 's now my favorite blend . 
i go for the bold varieties of coffee and this mahogany is not only bold but very smooth my all time favorite ! . 
so far this is the only k cup i 've found thats tastes great with a normal brew ! it 's not watered down like the regular stuff , and dose n't taste burnt like the bold stuff they only k cup i'm buying from now on ! . 
we 've tried every coffee brand available for the keurig , and this one is , by far , the best it 's extraordinarily smooth and rich the closest to starbucks , if that 's your thing i add to it a healthy splash of bolthouse coffee mocha very good . 
the mahogany has a smooth full bodied character i highly recommend this coffee to drinkers looking for a bold but not overpowering taste ! . 
this was sold out at cafe express site thrilled to br find it here quick delivery and great service ! happy to know that i can find it here . 
my favorite blend of my favorite coffee used to have to smuggle a few pounds of the stuff back in my suitcase everytime i went out to the midwest ! now i can get in k cups yay ! good price on amazon , but super saver shipping takes forever ! fedexing it to the post office makes no sense just fedex it to me and shave 2 days off the wait already ! . 
this coffee is very smooth but rather flat compared to starbuck 's brews it does n't have any bite to it br if you like a mild coffee , you will enjoy this one . 
let me be honest , i was n't expecting this to be very good i received a sample and it sat in the fridge for a good week before i was brave enough to give it a taste br br at first sip , it was much sweeter than i expected it to be i could certainly taste the pineapple , but the coconut flavor was much more pronounced than i thought it would be it was good ! i very much enjoyed the taste of the drink it was exotic and refreshing it was much fuller in weight , as i was thinking it would be watery with a mild flavor br br the box reminded me of those chocolate milks that i buy for my kids , but it did n't detract from the flavor . 
i have been buying one coconut water with a splash of pineapple regularly for awhile now i like the flavor and ordering it on line is very convenient also , i have had no problems with delivery br br unfortunately , iprozon has just lost my business i did n't mind paying 15 00 for a case of 12 i will not , however , pay 39 95 for a case of 12 that is robbery i can walk into fred meyer grocery and buy a case of 12 for 17 88 plus there are other sites still selling it for 15 00 per case i noticed iprozon is still selling the other flavors of one coconut water for 15 00 for a case of 12 so what on earth are they thinking br br i am quite unhappy with having to trust one of these other sites with my credit card information , but i am willing to do that versus paying nearly 40 for a case of 12 quite ridiculous . 
i was exhausted , hot , and dehydrated when i spotted this in a concourse store at jfk airport i was about to get on a 6 hour flight and water sounded too unsatisfying but juice sounded too heavy br i 'd heard the rumblings about coconut water so i looked to see if i liked any of the flavor options i ca n't stand mango and just about everyone adds it i was relieved to see the o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple so i figured i 'd give it a go br the woman at the counter said are you sure you want that \? it 's 4 steep ! but it 's an airport , what can you do \? by that point i was so wanting to try it i said sure after all , it would 've been 3 for a sticky sweet soda br i was so happy with it that i kept the empty tetra pack with me the whole time i traveled so i would know which one it was it does n't taste heavy \( in case the pina colada reference made it sound that way \) but the pineapple takes the edge off the green coconut water it 's amazing br i was happy to find it on amazon as i'm definitely hooked br since i have prime shipping , it gets to me in 2 days \( if i order it right , that is ! \) which saves me a trip to various local stores trying to see who still has it in stock br i'm totally thrilled with this stuff . 
o n e coconut water is delicious and refreshing it is amazing how it rids me of cramps in my calves and lower back . 
this drink is perfect for the summer it is a healthy alternative to soda , and a great way to hydrate your body i know this is n't the healthiest coconut water on the market \( it does have cane sugar \) , but it 's the best one for those who are new to coconut water , or just do n't prefer something as natural as pure coconut water my brother hates coconut water , but loves this stuff this drink is not too sweet , and has the perfect balance of pureed pineapple and natural coconut water subtly mixed together i like vita coco 's fruit infused waters as well , but find that this drink is a lot smoother in texture , and slightly more refreshing on a hot summer day . 
i happen to like foods that arent as sweet as kool aid or other sugary drinks very refreshing after mowing the lawn and helped keep those afternoon headaches away . 
i got the o n e coconut water w splash of pineapple it 's delicious not the least bit sweet just very refreshing ! ! love it and will continue using it saw this on dr oz as he recommended it . 
i saw this item in my local grocery store , and i thought i would give it a try br br i have to admit , i was very surprised about how much i enjoyed this item i found it refreshing , and i felt that i had a bit more energy i would happily purchase this product again and again br br a word of advice to people complaining that it does n't taste coconutty enough coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things coconut water comes from a green , immature coconut , while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut a hard , brown , fiber covered shell just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different , the same can be said of coconut if you do n't think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada , you will probably enjoy it even more . 
this is the best drink out there ! i 've always had adult acne and no matter what i took or what the dermatologist prescribed for me , it has always been so difficult to treat my acne i started drinking coconut water for the electrolyte benefits after my intense spinning classes but i noticed within several weeks that my face started to clear up and actually looked smoother ! besides keeping me hydrated and my electrolytes in balance , it has improved the quality of my skin tone ! love it ! ! ! ! ! ! . 
i started drinking coconut water when it was suggested to me by a friend i never really loved the taste of it , but i spend a great deal of time in the desert and i just ca n't seem to suck down enough water without getting waterlogged , so i was excited when i found flavors i know that recently it 's become trendy and much harder for me to find , but my friends have been drinking it for years , as has my yoga instructor , and they highly recommend it for drinking not only for sports , but also to keep hydrated plus , it 's done wonders for my always dry skin br br if nothing else it 's a great avoid a hangover cure if drunk before going to bed , and if your partied too much to avoid being sick it seems to work much better than pedialyte to get your electrolytes back in balance . 
i admit that i fully expected to dislike this product , and approached it with a dismissive attitude something that 's this trendy ca n't be any good , right \? well , i was wrong the one coconut water is refreshing , delicious , and just barely sweet really wonderful stuff the hint of pineapple adds a little bit of acidity that enhances the basic taste of the water i bet this would make a great summer drink too , but i only had one so i did n't get tot try that my problem now is that it 's been out of stock , so i ca n't get more . 
i decided to try this although i am not a big fan of flavored waters it is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions i happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix the one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition , even a splash puts it up front and center this added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some it would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or , in my case , after shoeveling the snow that seems to be deposited regularly this winter in the northeast . 
being a ride leader with a bicycle club , i use coconut water \( with its high potassium and vitamin c \) as an energy drink i prefer this product to that you find in ethnic markets , because it has no added sugar and it has n't been boiled . 
coconut water with a splash of pineapple br br this is refreshing ! it 's sweet , but not too sweet the coconut flavor is n't pronounced , and the pineapple is n't so overpowering that it tastes like syrup it 's clean tasting according to the packaging , it has five essential electrolytes , more potassium than a banana , no fat , no cholesterol , and no preservatives there 's a smidge of fiber , 0 8 g of protein and 16 g of sugars i suspect most of the sugar comes from the pineapple , but cane juice is one of the ingredients , too the 8 5 fl oz carton comes to 75 calories br br if you sign up for subscribe save , it 's less than 1 per carton actually , the carton is the only thing i do n't like about this drink it 's sort of hard to drink directly from because there is n't any air getting let in when you drink , which makes a vacuum this was solved by pouring it into a glass whew br br this was good i will definitely get more , and i highly recommend this to people who like pineapple juice . 
i love this stuff really , i do i have tried all of the flavors , but i have n't tried the original i have to say , by far , pineapple is my favorite guava is a close second who am i kidding \? i love them all ! br br despite what others say about it tasting best at room temperature , i find it tastes very refreshing and even better when on ice if you want a natural , tasty alternative to water , this is for you . 
since i had been recuperating from a 24 hour flu bug that lasted a br week , i knew i was low on electrolytes i opted for this product , br as some products tend to further aggravate my stomach and br acid reflux this worked out extremely well , and the taste br is good i will keep it on hand from now on ! . 
i have tried all the different brands of coconut water and o n e is my favorite and o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple is my favorite flavor i wish the price would come back down i absolutely love this stuff ! . 
then o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple is the drink for you i found this drink to be almost overpoweringly sweet as a standalone beverage according to the package , o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple contains natural coconut water , natural pineapple juice , cane juice , vitamin c , and natural fruit flavor personally , with the coconut and the pineapple , i think they could have left out the sugar cane br br however , when i paired o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple with a light snack of cheese and crackers , it became a very tasty , refreshing drink i , apparently , needed a little salt and or savory to make o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple completely palatable with the afore mentioned snack , the o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple is really delightful i can also see it being very invigorating on a hot summer today \( not so much with the cold winter weather \) br br o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple comes in a handy 8 5 oz box with a place to punch a straw through this type of packaging is nice if you are on the go or have kids just throw it in your bag and go br br prior to this experience , i had not heard of coconut water on the packaging it says o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple is a blend of the natural water from inside a young , green coconut and sweet , golden pineapple juice it has five essential electrolytes , more potassium than a banana , no fat , no cholesterol , and no preservatives huh who knew you could drink a green coconut \? educational and a good source of potassium being allergic to bananas , it is always good to have another source br br overall , i would not drink o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple by itself in the middle of winter but together with non sugary snack or in the high heat of summer , i would definitely give o n e coconut water with a splash of pineapple another try . 
this seems like a pretty straightforward drink it 's coconut juice and it 's pineapple juice , with a bit of sugar and not much else br br they claim it 's a good source of potassium and electrolytes br br for me it was pretty tasty granted it was also very sweet is it a health drink \? i do n't know if i 'd go that far it has vitamin c and trace amounts of calcium iron , but not much else other than sugar br br for what it is \( something sweet to sip \) , it 's pretty good . 
this is a close second to my all time favorite , jack links beef steakhouse steaks , which is the filet mignon of beef jerky they 're very similar in taste and price , but the steakhouse edges out this one oh so slightly still pretty awesome jerky , very tender , and not a hint of fat or gristle bon appetit ! . 
actually , sojo 's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw , but it an be cooked as i choose to do my dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy through veterinary mismanagement , he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1 2 years of his life after watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his inflammatory bowel disease , i took him to a holistic veterinarian part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of sojo 's and meat plus no medications i'm extremely pleased to report he has had no gi episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where i consider him healthy his coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he 's finally at a good weight i have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement , much of which i credit to sojo 's br br it does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble , but i make 4 days worth at a time this takes me about 30 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after to be completely honest , i'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but i am thrilled with the results if i was able to feed him raw \( perhaps down the road , when our vet gives the ok \) , preparation time would be almost nothing . 
sojos foods have been tested for nutritional content and they are all formulated to have a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1 4 1 you do not need to add calcium or phosphorus . 
i feed my dogs sojos as part of a mixed bowl of quality kibble and quality canned food i recommend sojos br br but i had a problem with the amazon purchase amazon stored the sojos bag in the original mailing box sojos sent them my order was picked from the shelf and the box containing the sojos was placed in another box and mailed to me the bag of sojos was almost one year old and there was no way amazon kept track of that i got a refund from amazon with no question and very quickly , but amazon needs to keep control of the use by dates of food they offer on their site . 
i have three newfoundlands so we go through a lot of food ! one of the dogs has had severe health issues and since we 've switched from commercial kibble to home made food , he 's thrived ! he gets regular blood tests to monitor the drugs he 's on and they have been perfect since we started on sojos ! it will not cure his issues , but he has more energy and he ca n't wait for meal time ! the other two are glowing with health as well ! all three dogs coats are shiny and they have tons of energy \( for a newf ! \) . 
i think this is a great product but my picky dog gets tired of it after a week . 
my small mixed breed is a picky eater but he seems to like solos so long as i mix it with some good people food he hasnt had problems digesting it delivery was prompt as expected . 
i have a now 8 month old male shih tzu when i brought him home from the breeder , i kept him on the 'pro plan puppy' tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished there was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as i put it down as a test , i rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen he 'd eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with \( which i was happy with , as i do n't want to 'play' with his food as a game to get him to eat \) i went and got him blue buffalo dry puppy food \( lamb and oatmeal formula \) , which had bigger size kibbles it seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits , since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones , venison antler , lamb lung chips for comfort again when i got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag , he would walk away from the bowl this went on for almost 3 days he was still having small bowel movements , urinating , drinking water and playing , running and continuing his successful training exercises called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by science diet veterinarian 's diet after the exam , which showed nothing physically wrong the one vet tech said that shih tzu 's tend to be picky eaters i did n't pick up the food at their check out counter , left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet i know from some of our outdoor excursions that he 's attracted to road kill \( he 'll sniff the air , and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices but i wo n't allow it \) i remember being a kid in the late 60 's early 70 's and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then gravy train or alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat they ate bones , etc and all lived into their late teens one of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old ! ! ! i never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem , since i grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance well , i read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighs breasts my weston is n't a big fan of totally raw meat , but when browned \( i put it in the toaster oven and add 1 4 tsp of 'missing link' to the meat portion \) with the soaked sojos original , he eats with gusto ! ! ! from his early days , i would play with and take his food away , so he 's not food aggressive he eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done weston then wants to play hard , train hard , take a nice walk and nap his coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed the droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up i just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this sojos mix with the same gusto \( even with the e collar to challenge him \) so i am a fan and we are finished with the second 2 5 lb bag and i just ordered another one hope this helps someone with a picky eater i know another reviewer mentioned their shih tzu not liking it , but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other , much like us humans . 
i did n't mean to order a 40 pound bag but i did wow that 's a lot of food be sure to mix it with protein or else you dog will suffer a bit of internal distress . 
i was introduced to these very small doggie bones at my vet my 14 year old springer who has never been much into doggie bones loves these things ! ! they make great pocket stuffers to carry around for incentive and motivation my old guy has a hard time waking up to go outside and one wiff of one of these bones does miracles i have a younger springer who also loves the bones but she does n't need much motivation to do anything , ha , but they are also great training aids i also sent home a handful of these bones with a painter i had at my home for his 3 dogs and he said they loved them too so i guess that 's antidotal but that 's 5 dogs that really love the things ! oh , the bones are way more expensive when you find them at your vet , about twice as much per pound , so this is a great buy buy a nice food safe container from home depot and fill it up you wo n't run out of bones for a while and that 's a good thing ! . 
it seems most of the organic shade grown fair trade coffee is medium or dark roasted , so i 've been having a hard time finding something that i like while this does n't wow me like some other coffees , it 's priced cheaper than those coffees and it 's a good brew for when i'm not really paying attention to what i'm drinking \( like when i'm working \) br br i'm definitely going to keep this one around , and just switch to the expensive \( better \) coffees that i 've found when i can really enjoy them br br compared to other coffee that 's not organic shade grown fair trade , this is an average light roast good , but nothing to get excited over it 's worth purchasing over those coffees because of the growing practices . 
i recently moved and could n't find a thai restaurant nearby my favorite meal at my old thai place was massaman curry i used the recipe on the back on the package when i got it , and it was just like what i get at the restaurant ! excellent flavor ! . 
we love to get masaman curry at our local thai restaurant , but i have n't been able to find a paste that actually tastes like it this paste does , and is very easy to prepare just add some coconut milk and heat add your protein and veggies of choice , done ! i have now bought some of the other mae ploy products , and found them all very good quality with authentic flavors . 
this is really delicious and not something you can find in the local grocery store if you did it would be very expensive and a much smaller quantity this is a good deal and super easy to use . 
i ordered this product to send to my friend 's husband they had just moved to alabama in the end of march , she could not find any diet peach snapple that tasted the same as what they had bought up here in new jersey he said that the water that was used down south made the diet peach snapple taste different ! so , now she is happy because she has found a source that they can buy his snapple from ! thank you . 
this peach flavored diet tea by snapple is extremely refreshing after a long summer 's day ! it 's truly a diet tea there are zero calories it 's best served chilled and it has a mild but not overwhelming peach flavor to it that is just right snapple makes this with green and black tea leaves there 's also a mild green tea flavor mixed in with the peach flavoring they use filtered water as well this tea is sweetened somewhat with aspartame but snapple adds in just the right amount so that it 's not excessively sweet if you want really tea that is rather sweet , you 'll either have to look further or use this with added sweetener it also contains phenylalanine and it is kosher if these are dietary concerns for you br br if you have other questions , the company has a toll free number so that people can contact them br br overall , this tea is perfect for a hot summer 's day when you want something cool to refresh yourself and whet your whistle i highly recommend this product . 
previously i bought some mustard seed that was unbearably bitter , but the mustard i made with this seed is very tasty and \( after mellowing a few days \) not bitter at all pleasantly spicy . 
in my quest to find snacks that are not empty calorie types , this is one of my new favorites great taste , and although a hefty calorie count , the decent amount of protein makes this a good choice for eating on the run , if a real meal just is not an option ! very satisfying i also tried the white sesame crunch , and that is ok too , but this one wins for taste . 
mrs may 's pumpkin crunch is a great snack for those of you watching calories and intake , be aware that the 2oz portions are two servings most of mrs may 's products are great , but with the fat at 11g per serving , i find it 's not a complete guilt free snack however , the pumpkin seed crunch has 9gms of protein per serving vs the usual 4gms in their other snacks so if you 're monitoring your intake and want to indulge in these now and then , the pumpkin seed crunch is the healthiest option of the bunch br br that said , they are all tasty and certainly not bad for you , just a little high in fat if you 're watching your weight . 
i love to put a bag of pumpkin crunch on the table at work and watch people 's faces light up when they taste them try it . 
mrs may 's pumpkin crunch is the best of the bunch if you like pumpkin seeds this is for you the slightly sweet cubes make me think i am eating cake these are great for snacking and even dessert a truly wonderful product and gluten free into the bargain ! . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b000eh2ama mrs may 's dry roasted snack , pumpkin crunch , 2 ounce pouches \( pack of 24 \) a br pumpkin crunch is great br stick with 2oz size \( 2 servings \) br much too easy to consume entire 5 5oz bag without realizing it br d lol . 
it has good tast and crunchy i bought black sesame before , it is good too highly recommanded . 
i picked this up at my local grocery store in the seasonal aisle with the easter goodies br br this moist cake mix can be made with or without eggs i used them , and was n't the least bit disappointed br br i paired the cake with pilsbury 's pink lemonade frosting , too but you could have it totally un frosted if you 'd like ! you will still love it ! br br perfect for the family dessert , children 's cupcakes , or a lovely addition to the ladies afternoon tea ! if you love pink lemonade you are going to love this ! br br the color just screams spring and easter ! and the taste will leave you screaming for another bite ! br br i give this 5 stars and my thumbs up ! . 
i normally bake from scratch but when i saw this pink lemonade cake mix with matching frosting i just had to try them both this cake can be made two ways with or without egg yolks i recommend with as the cake will be nice and moist as a result this cake would also be just as good with plain white icing or just a dusting of powdered sugar you can make it as a layer , bundt , or sheet cake , or as cupcakes i picked it up at the grocery store recently for about 1 80 per box , the frosting was about the same price per can i ended up going back and purchasing more for later as i believe this is just a seasonal flavor and pillsbury will pull it from the market at some point if they do i hope they bring it back every spring until then i 'll be stocking up . 
like i said about the icing i am so happy to be able to buy this online it is a family favorite , it also was shipped on time and arrived early definitely going to buy again . 
i picked up a box of this in a discount grocery store in paso robles the cake was heavenly i liked it so much , i found another store that sold the mix as well as the icing , and there is even a pink lemonade cookie mix which i bought but have n't tried yet br br the taste , is of course lemon , but it reminds me a bit of that flavored mix country time i drank as a kid , but less tangy its very light and refreshing br br i simply loved it hope this is more than just a seasonal flavor . 
i tried the cookies and they were great nd trying to find them in the stores br with no success did not realize they were seasonal or would have stocked up br great product . 
this is a great product , so it 's no surprise that the local shelves are often cleared of it , especially early in the season purchasing in bulk through amazon com is a dependable alternative bayer 2 in 1 in granular form feeds roses and flowers while protecting them with a systemic insecticide for up to 6 weeks , but you 'll need a separate fungicidal disease treatment , and the systemic would not be something one would apply to anything edible bayer assures me the product is safe for pollinators and earthworms . 
i have been a rose gardner for many years , i remember when this product was made by ortho and called rose pride this product really helps with the pests and diseases that roses tend to acquire though it does not stop all pests \( cane borers \) it stops the major ones that cause serious damage and spread disease i treat all my plants on the same monthly regiment and make sure to do it every four to six weeks making a note on my calendar like one other reviewer said you will not see immediate results with this since it is systemic for the best results make sure to read the package and work the granules into the soil and water in . 
i have been plagued by white flies for over a year neither chemical nor natural treatment has gotten rid of them completely i decided to try this as it 's made by a respected international brand i thought a systemic product might work br a week after the first application there was no reduction in infestation but by the second week i started to notice less less of the little vermin by the time i was ready to do a third application there was not even one white fly or any other insect on any of my roses or any other shrub i had even used it on potted plants which were also infested it worked on everything br remember , the product is systemic and is absorbed gradually into the plant so you will not see an immediate improvement but it works wonderfully also if like me , you do n't always remember to spray regularly or get the underneaths of the leaves , then something which you can sprinkle at the base of the plant every 6 8 weeks is certainly a lot easier to use . 
works wonderfully for most all applications in the garden could not be easier since it is systemic and helps fertilize only what you want to fertilize . 
these chips are good to sprinkle on salad , use in cookies and baking and sprinkle on cereal very pleased . 
this is the best mustard my husband loves it on his sandwiches for work it has the right spices and taste to enhance what you are eating have been looking for it in bigger tubes with not much luck but any size is great . 
this is the best i 've ever eaten if you like mustard and you like br horseradish this is the product to try br my first experience with thomy was several years ago when my son lived br in germany he used to send it home , but after he moved back to the br states the supply was cut off but when you notified me that it was br available , i was ecstatic br the blend is delicious , and goes well with your favorite crackers and br cheese appetizers or with anything you enjoy with mustard it adds br that little zing br give it a try , you wo n't be sorry . 
this mustard is not for the mild mannered , but for those who truly appreciate great german food ! this product is original as sauer kraut und rot kohl ! its taste is very original and authentic for those who will appreciate a bit of zip in their mustard try it on brats , burgers \( etc \) , and you simply wo n't be disappointed alles gute ! jim . 
there is n't much to say about this mustard other than ummm ummm good ! ! ! i tried this for the first time at a bbq on a salmon burger and it truly brought the flavor out of the meat now i use it on everything from chicken burgers to homemade caesers dressing ! you 'll love it ! ! ! . 
great with bratwurst , breakfast sausages , salami , cheddar cheese , sandwiches , etc , even though it is a bit exotic expensive to use with sandwiches where it tends to fade into the background , it 's best to keep it simple and let it stand out . 
it arrived on time and was packaged well this was my first try of this mustard it was unique , similar to many other hot mustards , but i favored it over the others i have because of the balance of flavors it 's almost as hot as english \( coleman 's \) mustard , but a little sweeter and maybe a slight vinegar essence in it the tube and a bag of pretzels lasted me one or two evenings . 
we became acquainted with this mustard when we were in switzerland and really enjoyed it that was our reason for purchasing it great find ! ! we have liked this as much as the one that we bought in europe ! . 
the lobster bisque is absolutely delicious nice lobster flavor i cannot imagine what you could possibly add to improve the taste of this soup just open , heat and enjoy i 've become such a fan of the baxter 's line that i ca n't wait to try them all . 
baxters soups are usually very nice , but the lobster bisque is especially good it tastes authentic , it has a good flavour , is creamy , and has just enough lobster bits to make it interesting add some fresh black pepper and a dash of brandy or sherry and it rivals soup served in a very good restaurant br br it 's also surprisingly low calorie though the nutrition info here says 130 calories for 8oz , the label actually says 120 calories , so even if you ate the whole can for lunch you would consume only about 220 calories . 
no doubt about it this is just the right combination of lobster , scampi , prawns with a hint of dry white wine a dash of brandy finish this soup to perfection br ingredients br water , lobster \( 4 \) , cod \( 3 5 \) , scampi \( 2 5 \) , concentrated tomato paste , modified cornflour , white wine , prawns \( 1 5 \) , skimmed milk powder , butterfat , double cream , salt , yeast extract , sugar , shrimp powder , fish powder , vegetable oil , vegetable extracts , stabiliser \( polyphosphates \) , brandy , concentrated lemon juice , spices , herb and spice extracts with celery br no artificial colours br no artificial flavours br no artificial preservatives br br information br gluten free br contains milk , fish , shellfish , celery . 
this was actually a gift to my daughter \( along with 3 cases of other baxter 's soups \) she 's of the opinion that baxter 's is absolutely the best canned soup on the planet \( of the soups she 's tasted , which include the major american brands she does n't cook much \) the lobster bisque rated just below baxter 's scottish smoked salmon \( which she rated the best ever \) \( from my own perspective , and usually cooking my own food , i have to admit that the baxter 's soup line , for canned soup , is superior \) . 
this soup is pretty good , not great ! i put some heavy cream \( 1 2 oz \) and some tabasco in it i have had a lot better lobster bisque but at a much higher price . 
in europe , you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet a great source of omega 3 oil , you can improve your health by eating these tasty , nutty seeds they are good for the gut and good for the heart br br the golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut brown seeds they look nice in baked goods like lighter breads they taste the same as the dark seeds ground , they do n't show up in white bread , so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber br br we like them sprinkled on oatmeal , muesli or yogurt . 
i 've been taking flaxseeds for several years due to the health benefits i was excited to see such a great price on these from a reputable company these are the best tasting flaxseeds i have ever had to get the maximum health benefits you have to finely grind them in a standard coffee grinder we usually grind 2 tablespoons per person twice a day and then add them to lemonade , crystal light , or tea and drink it down quick before it expands flaxseeds are loaded with minerals , vitamins , amino acids , and fiber they are excellent for weight loss and work well for chronic constipation there are several web sites out there that can tout the health benefits of flaxseeds but unfortunately it 's against the review guidelines to post links so i 'll just suggest to those of you wanting more information to search google . 
flaxseed is a great way to get fiber in your diet and this brand delivers it has a mild taste \( i put 3 tablespoons in my morning smoothie \) and gives you 36 of your daily fiber required intake flaxseed also contain omega 3 so you also place a powerhouse of nutrients in your diet with this little seed br br an excellent source of protein , fiber , and minerals such as magnesium and copper how can you go wrong \? . 
it 's best to buy flaxseeds as opposed to flaxseed oil or meal because you get more omega3 since you are grinding the seeds yourself , the released omega 3 oils are at their freshest br br i recommend storing these flaxseeds in the freezer you can keep them there after you open them as well i grind 2 tablespoons in a coffee grinder and then add it to yogurt or a protein shake good stuff ! . 
bob 's red mill organic golden flaxseeds are an excellent way to ingest some omega 3 96 ounces are delivered in 4 packs , and if you do n't use it all immediately i suggest storing the seeds in the freezer to keep them fresh grind them right before you use them , and they have a mild taste milder than brown flaxseed i 've ordered this product several times , and the quality has been consistently high . 
good product but remember that you need some way of grinding because apparently we ca n't digest whole flaxseeds . 
this is funny i bought the flax seed to make a neck warmer i made said to use flax seed and warm in microwave for 2 minutes bought 4 bags only needed 2 so decided to make use of the rest grind and put over any food the benifits are great br i put mine in yogert and cereal will diffently keep useing after this last bag will be ording again . 
i enjoy this flaxseed in everything i 've tried it in so far this product has a pleasant flavor , yet does n't over power the foods i put it in it helps to keep my digestive track regular i ground it in my coffee grinder and just sprinkle it on just about everything my husband and i love it in pancakes i enjoy it in my cereals and even on ice cream i especially like it mixed in my yogurt i highly recommend this product . 
i ordered this flaxseed after reading how good ground flaxseed was for you i ordered a grinder , both were reasonably priced , and the grinding was so easily accomplished i have been using flaxseed daily since that time , and the claims made on the internet have proven to be true the product arrived on time and in great shape i have purchased from this vendor several times , and have not been disappointed . 
i 've recently started drinking green smoothies to get healthier and had read that flax seeds have terrific health benefits such as lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol i add a tablespoon of chia seed and flax seed to my smoothies every day and since drinking my fruits and vegetables i feel better , lost some weight and have stopped having heart flutters i'm now looking forward to having my next blood work done to see how well it has helped highly recommend to anyone wanting to get healthy an all natural way ! . 
bought this as a way to take in omega 3 nutrient the pack of 4 has lasted me almost a year you have to grind up the seeds and freeze the rest no complaints very reasonable pricing . 
we are very happy with these organic golden flaxseeds we grind them and put them in so many things plus they make a great topping for yogurt and cereal in the whole seed form these are now a staple in our house . 
i have very little to say about the product except that it is a great product and their delivery subscription works very well . 
great for you ! grind them up and add a few tablespoons ca n't tell it 's there in your cereal ect . 
this brand always makes good products , since you buy bulk they turn out to be quite cheaper than in the supermarket very clean flaxseeds i add it to my smoothies to bath my joints with some natural raw omegas , supposedly they are better if eaten sprouted , though have n't tried it . 
these flaxseeds are of good quality , i eat them daily bought the whole seed , rather than the ground seed , because of the better nutritional value of grinding your own will buy again i read that whole seeds can pass undigested , and that ground seeds can loose their nutritional value over time so we grind a week 's worth at a time best used in oatmeal as the flavors blend well or in a cold cereal , or added to a cup of coffee for a twist seem to blend better in hot foods . 
it 's also a routine baking ingredient i put it into my bread along with sunflower seeds and organic wheat flour i also put it into my smoothie , stir fry dishes anything you can think of ! good price and really , it 's a must have for a healthy diet ! . 
looks fresh and clean i have roasted it in the toaster oven and i also use it in food whole or ground up in the coffee grinder . 
these are excellent quality flaxseeds ! i just toasted them a little on a pan and even that made a great snack ! i also powdered them in a coffee grinder after toasting them a little and the powder is delicious too \) delicious nutritious awesome ! \) \) \) planning to have it in my cereal tomorrow and maybe sprinkle some on my veggies i think i will also try out bob 's quinoa and museli . 
this is the 2nd order i have placed for bob 's red mill organic flaxseed it is a good quality whole flaxseed we grind it a little at a time and sprinkle it on cereal and in yogurt it keeps a long time in the freezer i have been using this flaxseed for about a year now , eating a tablespoon about every day and have noticed that my skin is softer , plus it keeps me regular , if ya know what i mean ! ! ! flaxseed is also a good way to get in some of the omega 3 's , that the body needs . 
the flax seed is packaged in separate smaller packages so that it can stay fresher longer and it was recommended by the flax cookbook i purchased this seed was cheaper than other brands i had checked on i am putting it away for any emergency that may arise . 
i bought this before i realized how much i was getting and before i knew they had it at the grocery store ! that was my own fault i really should have waited but the seeds are great , i just have way too many in my freezer ! . 
i hope that this is really as nutritious as the claims i chew on this like the romans and greeks and it gets stuck on my molars br br these seeds were easier going down when sprinkled on top of crab and egg fried rice go figure br br i incorporated a 1 5 cup into the regular white loaf recipe from the breadbaker 's apprentice and found that the addition meant more warm water was needed to hydrate the dough and i did not get much of a rise , so i baked the loaf with tin foil over the loaf pan and the bread rose to its usual height since white bread is not that healthy , i will include flax seed ground in my food processor to ameliorate the ill effects . 
these are wonderfully crunchy and delicious the calorie count is misleading , however ! one piece is more than the 25 calories they claim it is but it 's worth it ! . 
if you like nuts and you 're looking for a healthy , great tasting snack , you ca n't go wrong with almond crunch ! my husband and i recently eliminated high fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated soybean oil from our diet and we feel so much better trying to find tasty snacks that do n't contain these products is not easy so we were thrilled to find mrs mays naturals we love the cashew crunch as well ! . 
the nuts used tasted very fresh the bite sized chunks were just right it is lightly sweetened but not too sweet very satisfying \) . 
ok , i ca n't speak for when the last review was written , which looks like 2009 , but i'm looking at the back of a bag of almond crunch and it clearly says that the product is made in california , not china so if that was the main deterent back then , it 's no longer an issue i just discovered this snack and as a person who ca n't eat either gluten , soy , or dairy , i am thrilled to find a snack i can eat first of all , and a snack i can eat that is actually tasty , even better ! i 've been eating these for a few days now and no adverse reactions \( and i have an extremely sensitive stomach \) i plan on trying out all the flavors to figure out which ones i like the best but yeah , i 'd highly recommend this product to those on restricted diets and even to those who are n't . 
i'm known to be nuts for nuts , and i 've tried nuts from around the world , as friends bring them back for me as gifts very near the top of the list of the best nut snacks is mrs may 's almond crunch from the first time i tasted it , to every time i eat it now , i am amazed at the crunchiness , quality of the almonds , lightly sweetened glaze which is very unbrittle like , attention to healthiness in the ingredients , etc as a side note , because of how much i was impressed by this product , i went on a tasting spree by buying about 12 different kinds of mrs may 's products , from the peanut and cashew crunches to the various sesame crunches , etc perhaps i'm biased to the original , but none of the others have that same magic i would rate the rest as 4 stars but the almond crunch should get 6 stars . 
these are fresh , crunchy , natural , and healthy snacks you can reseal and keep in the car , crumble into non fat yogurt or over salads , or pack some in the kids lunch convenient and delicious . 
based on other amazon reviews , i tried this product the first shipment was great delicious thought i 'd found my new healthful snack 2nd shipment was a concern and disappointment even thought of calling the company but i did n't several different packages had incredibly hard pieces of \? \? was n't sure they were almonds became concerned i 'd chip a tooth , so i have n't ordered any more . 
delicious , healthy , plus amazon is cheaper than if you buy them from mrs mays actual website . 
love these snacks ! they 're a little bit sweet , loads of crunchy almonds am looking forward to trying the other varieties , too . 
after reading some of the frothing reviews criticizing mrs mays for manufacturing their product in china which does n't in any way address the quality of the product itself i tried to confirm this for myself the website and packaging say nothing about this , so i wrote them an email asking where their product is manufactured here is the response in full br br br br thank you for your purchase and inquiry we understand your concerns because br food item are very personal if you can spear a few moments to read details br about our quality assurance , it would be appreciated br br our factory in china is haccp \( hazard analysis and critical control point \) br by us agency brc certified uk agency haccp , brc kosher inspect our br factory twice a year and each organization also performs random unannounced br inspection at our factory br br please refer to the following sites if you like to learn more about the br haccp and brc certificate br br http www idfahaccp org br br http www brc org uk standards default asp \? mainsection id 7 br br in addition , all of our finished products are tested 3 times br br these tests are br salmonella testing br aflotoxin testing , and br microbiological testing br br our current customers like costco , bj 's wholesale and whole foods market br have very high standards on what they carry and sell to its members you br can rest assure that all of our products are safe to consume we also do not br have any melamine in our product our products are dairy free our products br are also tested randomly by fda and always passed the inspection br br the following is additional information br br here are the origins of the ingredients that we use br br almonds california br walnuts california br cashews vietnam brazil \( not grown in us \) br cranberries oregon canada br blueberries oregon canada br pomegranate oregon canada br natural flavors california br sesame seeds china \( not grown in us \) br rice malt china br cane juice us br sea salt china br br please feel free to contact us with any further questions , comments and br concerns we hope we have assisted you correctly br br thank you br br kind regards , br br julie br mrs mays br br br br i 've read other reviews criticizing over sweatshops , communism , and carbon footprint to briefly address these there has been no evidence that mrs mays keeps its workers in sweatshops despite the communism , i'm sure the individual citizens find these jobs valuable and ships produce 1 10th the carbon per pound mile of trucks , meaning a 5000 miles by ship is as bad as 500 miles by truck br br i really like the snack and i 'd give it five stars , but i'm subtracting one star i think it is deceptive that it was so hard to find out the snack was made in china i do n't have a problem with the snack 's origin , but mrs mays should be more forthright with their customers and let them make the decision themselves granted , most of us americans are primed to flip out at the latest scare of the week , but that should be our choice to make br br oh , and the snack itself \? it is quite tasty , filling , and healthy i will continue to purchase it . 
my husband has diabetes and has to watch what he eats this is a great and healthy treat for him ! i could n't find it at local stores , and was happy to see it available on amazon ! . 
there ought to be a recovery program but the good side is that a mrs mays addiction is healthy i already have a stack of boxes in the garage so i wo n't run out and here i am stockpiling more \( in case of nuclear holocaust \) br br almonds have always been my staff of life raw , roasted , dry roasted , blanched , flavored , and of course mrs mays i rarely have a day without them i even feed them to the parrot a bird guy told me they were the healthiest and the bird goes nuts for mrs mays br br these are , dare i say , miracle nuts one taste and i was hooked how she can pack all that goodness into such a tasty snack with such healthy ingredients is a miracle if you 're tired of tastless , bland , gotta eat it because its healthy snacks from the nutrition store , try these for a pleasant awakening br br mike . 
we are typical americans who know we should eat better , but often do n't because health food is usually expensive and frankly does n't taste that good that is why we are so thankful to have found mrs may 's products ! ! they are all very healthy and quite tasty , and ordering them from amazon keeps the cost down my son 's a golfer , and i am always looking for portable , healthy snacks for him to tuck in his golf bag mrs may 's products fit the bill nicely . 
my family and i love almond crunch , they 're just sweet enough , very crunchy , and a perfect snack . 
i have tryed the almond crunch and is delicious and healthy snack better than chips try it you 'll agree . 
this product is excellent it 's also a nut snack that my wife , who has celiac disease , and is allergic to wheat and glueton can enjoy i however can eat anything and this is the tastiest and most unique nut snack i 've ever tried al virginia weatherly 53996 luzerne dr macomb , mi 48042 . 
this is by far the most delicious snack you could ever have ! ! the almonds are super fresh and crunchy and the light coating of syrup is not too sweet my whole family loves it ! ! . 
my husband and both love almonds i 've even shared this snack with co workers and everyone is raving about the good taste of this snack i'm taking a few bags on our next backpacking trip . 
the negative reviews of mrs mays products just because it is made in china are not really valid , cannot base on other companies' poor quality control and apply to every company in the country ! there are many bad quality foods that are made in the usa that 's bad for your health , so just because it 's labeled made in usa does n't mean it is good quality as long as a company takes pride in their quality control and not greed for profit only deserves good ratings and fair sales . 
this is a great product we tried it at the beach the first time and loved it the cashew crunch was not as good br we bought a case of the almond this week just great ! . 
i am in love with this tea every other apple cinnamon tea i 've tried has been too cinnamon y this is the perfect blend it tastes like apple cider without all the sugar , which i love i recommend this tea to anyone who wants a low cal version of apple cider . 
this is the perfect gift with a southwestern flair the jelly 's were of decent size , the spreader is a nice quality piece with a small glass chili pepper attached br br cute little bag great gift for the price ! . 
montebello pasta has been made at the monastero di montebello in isolo del piana , italy since 1388 i love italian food but have severe digestive and allergic problems , and their pasta is friendly to me , and it tastes better than any other pasta i have eaten , and that 's a lot , it is one of my favorite foods . 
so i usually consider pasta to be pasta to be pasta it 's usually all the same to me however when i tried this brand of pasta , i noticed that it does taste better i ca n't describe how exactly , but it does i thought maybe it was my imagination \( maybe knowing it 's organic was influencing my judgment \) but my sister commented on it when i served it for her one day she wanted to know where i got it it tasted so good hmmm so while usually there is n't much of a taste difference when it comes to noodles and pasta , for this brand there is it 's subtle , but it 's there when we moved from california i discovered they did n't sell it in the stores here in ny so i was elated when i found amazon carries it elated over a simple pasta \? yes , that 's how good it is in comparison ! mmmmmm mmmmm ! . 
best taste pasta cooks very well , slightly less time than typical mass produced pasta nice color and mouthfeel just excellent . 
i have long searched for a great linguine and spagetti and this is it ! just made linguine with clam sauce and each time my husband remarks how terrific it is i buy in packages of 5 for both spagetti and linguine and will reorder when close to being out . 
good product just a little mellow on the pumpkin pie flavor to me a little sugar on top before you brew picks it a enough though overall good coffee . 
these are hard to find these days product arrived perfect and the gum was fresh and tasty we kept the box for about 1 year and the last pack tasted as good as the first . 
gum made without sugar substitutes is n't easily obtained these days , so i was happy to find chiclets through amazon prime sugar substitutes present problems for persons sensitive to them , so it 's good to have the option of gum made the old fashioned way another source for this and other gum from yesteryear is vermont country store online however vcs sells the same box of chiclets for 14 95 , so clearly amazon is a better deal amazon prime \( free shipping \) makes it a much better deal br br my great grandpa used to come home with chiclets from time to time , so this gum is n't just loaded with long lasting peppermint flavor , but long lasting , happy memories , as well i guess you can say there 's a lot packed into such a little piece of gum hope you enjoy as much as i do . 
i love drinking green tea it is delicious hot or cold , but being able to take it with me anywhere was key so i searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome , expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the us in the beginning , what i found was either too expensive , had sugar in it \( which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place \) or did not get very good reviews then i found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping i was pleasantly surprised br br the product works as advertised it dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too the instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water , but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water , otherwise it can be too bitter br br it not only saves money , but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that i need to recycle monthly . 
the first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products if you do not want to read that part , skip down to the bottom , and there is the review of the stash teas , only br br br br a couple of years ago i had a physical and my doctor told me that my triglycerides were high i was a serious soda drinker \( sometimes as many as 5 cans per day , not diet \) , so i decided i needed to start drinking something healthlier i gravitated toward green tea because i like it i averaged 2 3 1 2 liter bottles per day for 2 years \( i also averaged about 1 2 cans of soda per day \) br br i recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down they doubled they were over 300 \( over 150 is considered high \) i about had a heart attack right there now , i am not an overweight person , and have had a fairly high motabolism , but i have started to create a belly \( i call it a dr pepper belly because that is my favorite soda i do not drink alcohol of any kind \) i am telling all of this to you because all of my other tests came in within normal levels , including all other aspects to my cholesterol br br i did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area , it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products the excess sugar consumed , in this case , can be turned into trigylcerides i looked at what i was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me what i found shocked me the 1 2 liter bottles of green tea has more sugar in it than a can of soda i checked several different manufacturers of green tea and i found them all to have about the same amount of sugar br br i concluded that between my morning coffee , green tea bottles and soda , i was consuming over 1 , 100 grams of sugar a week \( or about 4 , 000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks \) ! ! br br br br i was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products i personally , do not have the time or patience to use tea bags , so i was interested in the tea powders i ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it and i loved it i then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also br br there are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added , so i use a few drops of stevia glycerite to sweeten the drink it does not take a lot br br the best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1 2 or less than the bottled green teas i use to drink br br br br to end on a personal note , i have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1 liter of water per day i still drink 1 can of dr pepper on the weekend , but that is it i have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills , i have lost about 5 lbs and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks br br i hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is . 
i like the taste of this product , but i have some suggestions br br 1 \) for strongest blueberry taste , use less than the 16 ounces of water that the instructions indicate \( my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberry \) br br 2 \) stir really well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway , as well as for an oddly green \( i know it 's green tea , but i rarely drink green things , so it seemed a bit weird to me at first \) and br br 3 \) if you 're going to use a sweetener , why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or splenda or etc \? i added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect , but then i also like it without any sweetener at all \( as long as i use less water \) br br by the way , this makes hot tea as well , although it 's marketed as iced tea powder br br enjoy ! . 
i ordered this item because it was on sale and because of the health benefits of green tea i was n't certain how good it was going to be but i was pleasantly surprised it tastes refreshing and fruity the flavor is n't overpowering or fake i mix the powder in a sports bottle along with cold water and splenda the powder dissolves easily and the drink has a nice green tea and blueberry taste i was so impressed that i have signed up for automatic delivery it 's a great product . 
if you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder the instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but i 'd recommend you try two packets and one packet \( 0 35 oz \) of stevia the flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild , so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor when you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each if you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks that is only 47 cents per drink if you get free shipping i ordered some books too i think that is fairly reasonable i look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices a website is given for additional recipes there are a few interesting recipes like the ones for white chocolate green tea ice cream , green tea papaya nectar and green tea sugar cookies you will probably find many uses for this and i 've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water no brewing required this tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water i can highly recommend it to you br br the rebecca review . 
lots of uses for this green tea br br i generally like most tea \( though not the over ally flowery blends \) br br being on more of a health kick in recent years , i have added a lot more green tea to my diet in one form or another br from straight brewed tea lt hot or iced br br to adding the powder to things like salad dressings , smoothies , baked goods , etc br br i am not new to green tea as i first started drinking it when living in japan some 30 years ago br in the ground form known as matcha br a quality product dissolves well br br i like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened . 
ingredients listed pure cane sugar , and 100 pure powdered japanese green tea br br nutrition facts all 0 , except sodium \( 15mg \) and sugar \( 12g \) br br basic instructions add one packet to 8oz of cold water and stir or shake well to dissolve br br my opinion it is too sweet for my taste , even diluted in a 16 9oz water bottle it almost tastes like sugar water i think the unsweetened version would be better 5 star because it delivers what it promises br br this is japanese green tea not chinese green tea there is a difference . 
i keep this at work and i mix in my smoothies at home love it ! . 
i make a jug of this tea every morning and keep a glass throughout the day i'm delighted to find a source in the us as it was introduced to me in b c it does not have the jasmine flavor which upsets my otherwise very strong tummy . 
this is good iced tea it is hard to find locally in the fall and winter . 
this is a quick and convenient way to drink green tea ! i add lemon juice and stevia . 
to get a more intense taste , i mix two packets in a 16 oz bpa free camelbak bottle , adding 8 oz of water and the rest ice , plus a packet of stevia , shake well , sip , and oh so good ! no calorie sweet tea , green tea antioxidants , and i'm drinking a lot more water i also carry packets in my purse and add to water in restaurants , saving tons of money from ordering drinks and not to mention calories although the stash rep tells me there is a negligible amount of caffeine , the placebo effect gives me a great boost in the morning before my workout since i love mint , i think i 've found the perfect product . 
this tea is more ginger than lemon , so if you like the taste of soothing ginger , you 'd like this product i mix two packages per 16 oz bpa free camelbak bottle , filled with 8 oz of water and the rest ice , and a packet of stevia shake well , take sip , ahhh no calorie sweet tea , green tea antioxidant , and great for summer i called the stash company to find out how much caffeine was in a packet , and the rep said negligible br br i also buy the stash powdered mint green tea , and i prefer the hint of mint better again , if you are a ginger fan , you 'd really enjoy this product . 
i think this is a great green tea powder i add this powder to a 24oz water bottle and it has a nice light taste , i prefer it unsweeted so that i may add a sweetner if needed great price for the quantity and the quality of the product . 
i use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies provides you all the health benefits of green tea love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger . 
i like the mild sweet flavor of this instant tea i 've added it to lots of different drinks like juices and energy drinks i have fun mixing it with things it blends well for me . 
this is a quick easy way to make green tea it is n't sweet only has the barest hint of blueberry , but it makes it easy when pressed for time in the morning it does have more green tint to it than most teas here 's why sencha green tea comes from the kyoto region of japan it is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea additionally , the color of the tea is actually green , not yellow , like many chinese varieties powdered tea is also good for cooking as well . 
i went on a diet last year and was looking for something goos to drink and came across this tes ! now i ca n't find it anywhere hope amazon keeps this product forever ! . 
i held off ordering these for a while because i was concerned i might not like the taste i 've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on i really wanted something powdered to take to work though , so i gave it chance and it worked out to me , this product tastes great i am thrilled to get something unsweetened i wanted these to use at the office , but find i like them so much i mix them up at home too i just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast i went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot , to experiencing them as hardly enouugh ! br br basically , this product has a mild taste , never bitter or oily and not gritty \( but it will need to be remixed if you do n't drink it down quickly \) the powder does mix well , it 's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything it blends completely into the water , but it does n't stay mixed over a long period of time so , if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away , it 's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along that works for me , no complaints i am very happy with the product i will order again . 
i wanted something easy , tasty , and healthy to sub for my diet soda addiction this did the trick i drank it for 10 days without adding any sweetener once you get past the color , which is a nasty green , the tea is tasty about a half tsp of sugar really adds to the taste i will buy this again ! . 
if you like the flavor of green tea and like your beverage iced you will enjoy this beverage br br i like the taste of green tea and i also like the health benefits of green tea i mix this with ice water and splenda it is a refreshing summer beverage i like that it dissolves easily and is packaged in small packages it is convenient and easy to use . 
this is just the quick iced tea fix i have been searching for it is perfectly balanced between the green tea and the natural , refreshing blueberry flavor keep in mind this is not sweet and sassy , like most instant tea add to bottled water packets this is the real deal if you want sweet , then order the sweet variety or add your favorite sweetener when you add the powder , it is green looks alittle weird , but once you can get past the looks , it 's true love i think it 's delightful that i am actually consuming the entire leaf finely ground to which it dissloves thus making my water become murky , swamp water before my eyes ! that has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants , opposed to the old brewing way br i have had a very difficult journey \( until now \) finding yummy , healthy \( quick \) unsweetened flavored teas my second favorite is the celestial seasonings cool brew bags the blueberry green tea is also delicious , but not nearly as refined as this top shelf stash br i am pondering more flavors for my next order ! . 
good flavor , but not real sweet i add a little stevia for my sweet tooth . 
drank an instant green tea from a major producer for several years then they changed production and began using sucralose which i do n't tolerate well br tried several different teas before i found stash 's instant green tea i like it best with a little fresh lemon lime juice i can drink all i want do n't even need sweetener plus as i understand it , it 's just made from dried , pulverized green tea leaves no chemical process also it 's very coolby i get a discount forn having it delivered by monthly subscription phil k . 
this ice tea , is like heaven on ice must try if you love lemon and giger great price for the content you can make a pitcher with 4 bags and add some lemon and whatever your sweetner you prefer great for barbeque parties or a tea with the ladies . 
this tea is awesome you have to keep stirring it if it sits too long but the taste is great little prep time keeps me going all day . 
this product is great i have been searching for an easy to use and non sweetened green tea so many of the teas are sweetened with splenda type sweeteners and i prefer to use stevia the jackie chan green tea appears to have been discontinued br br i mix this product and love the taste a little lemon and stevia and i have the perfect evening iced tea it provides all the benefits of green tea , and the instant convenience br br i give it five stars . 
this is the best iced green tea i 've ever had the hint of blueberry is just perfect i add a bit of stevia for a little more sweetness it would be an insult to call this instant tea , but i carry a packet in my purse because it 's better than any prepared tea i could buy when eating out stash tea is always good , but this is extraordinary . 
i first tried these powdered green teas from stash last summer this spring i wanted more , but the store i got them from did n't think the vendor would be carrying any i was delighted to find that i could get them from amazon i ordered a whole bunch and look forward to having refreshing real food drinks all summer in an easy to make form . 
i finally finished my box of the blueberry green tea powder and wanted to try something new ! so glad i tried this flavor as it is now my favorite ! just add it to a cold bottle of water , drink it as is , or add a few drops of stevia or agave and you are good to go very refreshing ! ! will be packing this on my trip to mexico ! . 
lots of uses for this green tea br br i generally like most tea \( though not the over ally flowery blends \) br br being on more of a health kick in recent years , i have added a lot more green tea to my diet in one form or another br from straight brewed tea lt hot or iced br br to adding the powder to things like salad dressings , smoothies , baked goods , etc br br i am not new to green tea as i first started drinking it when living in japan some 30 years ago br in the ground form known as matcha br a quality product dissolves well br br i like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened . 
as a long time tea drinker , was happy to come across this iced tea mix it serves as my sports drink while exercising or golfing i find this iced tea very refreshing i really like the flavor and especially the low sugar content the plain green is my favorite followed by the raspberry the blueberry is good too it 's unsweetened , so i add half a packet of truvia . 
i really enjoy this tea because it 's not to sweet and it 's easy to use i carry it and my mug with me and just add hot or cold water , depending upon my mood i find that it gives me just the right kind of energy and it can even hold my hunger between meals a real great thing because i watch my calories and of course , green tea is full of antioxidants . 
this is good iced tea it is hard to find locally in the fall and winter . 
i am hooked this is a great way to get more fluids into my day without making it seem like a chore this powder tastes great without any additional sweeteners it is just what i have been looking for also try the blueberry version delicious ! . 
green tea is good for you , loaded with antioxidants , boosts your metabolism , yadda , yadda , yadda , but i never quite warmed up to the taste until now the lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor and it is so great that i can just add a packet to my water bottle and go , without the bother of brewing it . 
just the right amount of blueberry flavor , and the tea itself is not overwhelming i love that it has no added sweeteners , and really does not need them br this is a perfect way to get more water and benefit from the antioxidants in the tea as well ! . 
i drink this delicious tea almost every day i have yet to find anything like it on the market . 
love this product ! it adds flavor to your water without all the nasty artificial sweetners hope this product is here to stay ! . 
powdered green tea with lemon ginger provides quick daily source of antioxidant ingredients desired but in higher concentration and without the bother of brewing tea bags simply pour in water bottle , shake and be on your way br br product used to be available in local health food stores but is no longer carried much easier and more cost effective when bought in quantity on amazon .

i was looking for mint green tea i could carry with me to mix up while out and about if that 's what you want , then this product is perfect i add a little extra water , but that 's just my taste so , if you 're looking for mint green tea powder look no further ! . 
this has a great rich taste remember this is ground whole leaf , so the tea is stronger than you may expect not overly sweet and dissolves readily i use it during workouts mixed with ice water in a polar bottle . 
i liked the flavor and the ease to mix this tea i use a few packets and make a pitcher to keep in the fridge very good cold and needs no sweetening as is lightly sweet already does n't look pretty , but does look like a healthy drink ! i liked it ! . 
i purchased this item when it was on sale i was n't certain if i 'd like it but i 've read so much about the health benefits of green tea i wanted to try it this is a nice , pleasant beverage the flavor is n't too strong i add a packet of splenda to make it a bit sweeter the powder dissolves easily in cold water the flavor is natural not fake i was impressed enough with it that i have signed up for auto delivery . 
love this ! i dislike drinking plain water and have been looking for something easy that i could add to my s s water bottle \( gotta be good to the environment , right \? \) the flavor is great , ease of convenience is wonderful and the hint of sweet is not overpowering at all i can drink my green tea with or without sweetener the only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long , the calories will add up i think each packet is 60 calories i drink 2 \( 32 oz \) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day but i will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab i 'd just pick something else if i'm going to pound water all day long \( perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is not sweetened it 's excellent as well \) i 'll use this for one bottle and a non sweetened one for the other best of both worlds enjoy ! . 
i used to always go to jamba juice for the match green tea shots after trying this iced green tea powder i was hooked this flavor is lightly sweetend and the raspberry and pomegranate flavors are just subtle enough to not mask the true flavor of the green tea i do n't mind the funny green color after all it 's green tea . 
i have never liked green tea but i knew it was good for me so i have been drinking it for a lot of yrs i grew up living in the western usa and our neighbors were japanese they were sweet and gave us tea from japan my father enjoyed it every morning and added a tablespoon of honey and a little cream to it he smoked all his life and died at 92 anyway , i found when at times i would quit drinking it i would n't feel as good as i did when drinking it i got tired of boiling the water with the teabags and then getting everything in a container to put into the frig i really drank a lot of it well , i stumbled onto a warehouse to pick up some things i had ordered and noticed this tea i was immediately interested as you get to drink the whole tea leaf which gives you 10 times more antioxidants wow , that was good for me so i got a couple cases and when i ran out searched the internet for stash brand i really love it i love that it is lightly sweetened , i love that i can just open a packet and throw it into my tumbler , add ice and water and be on my way it 's just right but more then anything else i love the way it makes me feel so much more energy and i truly believe it is helping my well being no getting around about it i do n't get sick often for sure now i have n't tried the other brands and i feel i do n't have to because i am so satisfied with this one the price is also cheaper i do n't think you can go wrong with this choice perky . 
love the ease of having green natural tea anywhear any time tastes great i love this stash green tea . 
this is one of my favorite water add ins i think it has a really crisp , clean taste with a hint of grassy ness the tea particles tend to settle at the bottom of the bottle , if left standing for more than a few minutes , so i have to shake it up periodically there are times when i feel like i'm drinking something that was squeezed off the blades of a lawnmower , but this seems to be based on my choice of sweetener it tastes great when i use stevia , but when i use sweet low i get a bitter ish grassy taste . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b0012bzghs stash premium mint green iced tea powder , 12 count packets \( pack of 6 \) a light mint taste , easy to mix powdered tea , great on ice . 
what a lovely tea this is ! the rose petals are abundant in the mix , and when you brew a pot of tea and then raise the cup to your lips , the full , sweet scent of roses greets you ! this tea is perfectly blended and balanced ! its color is coppery golden , very warm and luscious i just want to drink it every day , for relaxation and sheer enjoyment ! . 
this is my first exposure to rose tea i purchased it because of the previous review i have to concur this tea is delightful the aroma is fantastic and makes you believe you are in the midst of a blooming rose garden it is a perfect tea to sip in the winter months as it fills your senses with the scents of summer i bet it would be refreshing as an iced tea with a sprig of fresh mint too cold to try that now , but once the snow melts , i will ! great product for the price ! . 
wow ! i am a pepsi holic and was gaining weight as you can imagine a little 85 year old woman introduced me to your tea hot and now with just a little bit of honey and ice i have a nice cool refreshing drink ! ! . 
i am pleased the bag is so large it means i 'll be sipping this tea for a while this tea is perfect for the start of the work day the rose and hibiscus liven my senses the caffeine pushes me to type a bit faster as i climb over a hillock of e mails the flavors are a bit more pungent than similar blends i 've mixed on my own \( is the cause the mysterious natural flavor another reviewer pointed out \? \) , but it is still quite pleasant i certainly look forward to many more mornings begun over several cups of rose congou . 
the fragrance of the tea totally blew me away recommend it to anyone who enjoys mild green tea with a pleasant rosey scent . 
i am enjoying this tea and the price was reasonable i do n't think the rose flavor is as pronounced as my favorite rose tea , but since i can not get that one at this time , i ordered this one , and it is very good . 
i bought this tea many months ago and waited to review it , to see if i really liked it over time br br i do this tea is really lovely the rose scent and taste are just right not too lame , not too overwhelming i find it slightly calming , even with the caffeine from the black tea of the 6 or so loose teas in my drawer that i regularly use , this is the one i seem to reach for most often i'm diligent about brewing times this one is 5 min and i set the timer gives me a perfect cup every time br br do n't forget that it 's organic support organic practices and do something beneficial for your body br br this tea was a good buy and has withstood the test of time \( for me \) . 
good beans i ca n't find these in the grocery stores where i live , but ordered them through this retailer with no problems . 
adzuki \( or azuki \) beans are ment to be used in asian sweets you can make sweet bean paste by boiling the beans for 30 40 min , \( changing the water out at least twice \) draining and mashing the beans with sugar \( strain the paste if you do not like the bean skins \) what you get is a paste that can be put on ice cream , fill pasteries or stuff into mochi cakes . 
their not only good for you but their yummy they smell like cloves when their cooking and taste a little sweet . 
good stuff like lentils you do n't need to soak these they are small so feel good in the mouth . 
i really like this flavoring i try to stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners so this was perfect because it contains absolutely no sweetener so i can add my own \( mostly liquid stevia \) i also love vanilla flavoring in many things i make so i sometimes use this in place of extract which can be pricey if you use it a lot for example , i make my own almond milk so i like to add vanilla to sweeten and lighten the taste this works better than an extract because there is no alcohol taste i also make blueberry syrup with agave and this flavoring and it turns out very good i put it in pancake batter and the flavor still holds after cooking \( also with cookies \) i use this all the time and now i am not dropping 10 every couple of weeks for vanilla extract . 
we 've been eating this delightful cereal for several years my kids always feel better on gluten free foods and so do i unlike the popular junky cereals , this version of a slightly chocolately cereal is light and not too sugary and it 's a special treat for the kids i also like supporting envirokids products the pricing has come down to where it 's nearly the same as the other mainstream cereals that are not as good for you . 
we received this as a gift , along with some homemade graham crackers my husband and i have become addicted to it if you love things like lemon meringue pie , you will adore this luscious , lemony spread on grahams , pound cake , etc just a thin layer of this delicious confection enlivens your taste buds with an explosion of flavor i highly recommend this product if you are looking for a very special treat . 
i have never tasted any better ! need to keep refrigerated or it will lose color and flavor but is worth the price . 
mixed with whipped cream and blueberries this lemon curd is a delicious , easy , quick summertime dessert that will delight any guests . 
the popcorn itself is yummy , just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper the kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped it 's great in the microwave or a pan , but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper . 
i wo n't claim to be a professional food taster i just know what i like and do n't like i do n't like yellow popcorn , i do n't like microwave popcorn , i like the white popcorn cooked in a pan for my popping style the baby white pops great w o lots of hard kernels 'nuf said . 
this is really good tender , a little sweet easy to make in the whirley pop , and excellent with some cheddar spice popcorn seasoning ! . 
i was a little concerned to buy the popcorn , as you never know what you are going to get but i did and i am glad i did the popcorn is nice and tender , pops easy , great taste and hull less i have moved from the microwave popcorns and glad i did because of this product i like the fact the the popped corn is small but great ! . 
we like the much harder to find white popcorn over the more common yellow popcorn and amish country baby white is our absolute favorite we usually order 3 of the 6 lb bags 'cause we go thru it so quickly . 
i love this popcorn only downside is the shipping and packing cost almost as much as the popcorn need to pack it better bag split and a bunch of loose popcorn falling out of the box when the guy brought it to my door . 
this is the best popcorn i have ever ate i use a whirley popper to pop my popcorn when you eat this baby white hulless you will never go back to any other popcorn i gave my orville redenbacher 's and walmart popcorn away to many husks you just ca n't beat this popcorn it tastes sooooo good even my puppy loves it . 
i first had this popcorn at my 84 year old cousin 's home i thought it was so tender and delicious , and i wanted to buy some for myself i found it on amazon com believe it or not ! ! ! anyway , i ordered 6 pounds of it all 6 pounds are now gone this popcorn is really good it is different than other popcorns i have eaten because the kernels are small and very delicate i consider myself a pro when it comes to popcorn because i have eaten it every night since i was a little girl i usually eat my popcorn 1 kernel at a time , but since the kernels are so small , i ate it by the handful my only complaint is that it does cost a lot to have it shipped i wish i could find it locally so i would not have to pay for the shipping costs if you like popcorn , i highly recommend it . 
over the years i have bought a lot of popcorn for popping and i have found this small baby white hulless to be the best for popping and not a lot of the so called old maids i also had to retire my 20 plus year old wabash valley farms stovetop popper it was a good one so if you like popcorn and who doesn't this popcorn and popper combination is the best and the popper comes with a 25 year warranty as well money well spent you will not dissapointed with either of them so enjoy . 
this is the best popcorn i have ever had as a kid i ran the popcorn machine in a theater so i feel i know what i'm talking about we used yellow popcorn but i still think white is best . 
baby white popcorn from wabash farms pops nicely , has no meanacing hulls to get into your teeth , and is very tasty what more could you ask from a popcorn \? i highly recommend this product at least a four star . 
the small , white popcorn is the best ! very delicious and i 've tried lots . 
this was the sweetest , smallest , hulless , best tasting white popcorn i have ever had just placed an additional order for a 6 lb bag as well as other varities carried by this company . 
great popcorn ! ! good popping results and wonderful flavor ca n't help but love it and i will re order when i run out recommend to one and all . 
i love little white kernels of popped corn this was good stuff , but i think i 'll try a larger white kernel to pop next time , my preference . 
pops great in the microwave much better than many store brands good product . 
my doctor told me i must eat hulless popcorn if i have popcorn at all because i ca n't give up my favorite snack , i bought this wabash famnily farms amish country popcorn the kernels are tiny , but they pop well , although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn i get from the grocery store it tastes great , however , and has fewer and smaller hulls i do n't think there is such a thing as completely hulless , but ido notice thst i do n't get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore . 
i ordered 3 6lb bags with free shipping because of the reviews i really like it but the real test was my wife 's opinion and we also ordered 4 and 1 2 lbs of popcorn from the boulder popcorn co and the kernels were a little smaller and tasted better we use coconut oil and it has very good flavor even without butter i really like the cambria 's cream kernels the best . 
i just made some in my whirley pop it really is lighter and crisper than the larger , yellow kernels none of those large hulls either the only difference is , it pops up much smaller than the yellow , so you need to almost double the amount of kernels used per pot lovely homemade popcorn . 
use olive oil to cook this , salt it well , and it is the best , most tender popcorn i have ever eaten i add a tiny bit of butter to mine , but do n't need it my nine year old daughter did n't like popcorn until she reluctantly tried this after a few bites , she consumed half the bowl ! br br i bought mine at a specialty popcorn shop in long grove il , so i did n't have to pay shipping costs , but when it 's gone , i might have to bite the bullet and order it from here . 
we 've enjoyed this popcorn every bit as much if not more than the movie theater popcorn it 's light and fluffy tender and delicious i think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no palm oil or coconut oil in it we can control what oils we add or leave out it works well with the popper in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other we enjoyed this more . 
i bought the whirley pop stovetop popcorn popper several months ago , which \( of course \) the wabash valley popcorn came recommended \( same company \) i thought what the heck i 've always wondered how gourmet popcorn differed from orville or other everyday popcorn brands br br let me tell you it is worth the extra money ! i can really taste the difference in quality and , normal popcorn just does n't taste right when you make it in the whirley pop br br this popcorn is so tender and tasty it was a little weird to see and eat at first because it 's about half the size of regular popcorn but , i believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn br br my favorite prep methods include using the whirley pop and nutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil \( see my review for that for more details ! \) i add a little peanut oil , sea salt , black pepper , and a good amount of vegaline garlic mist cooking seasoning spray yummy ! ! ! ! br br i 've tried the other amish country popcorn , and they 're all good this is my favorite , though ! . 
this popcorn is really great ! we enjoy the taste and the smallness of the actual popcorn its not like the popcorn that is big and fluffy its small and really great to eat i eat only this popcorn now and order every three months highly recommend to the popcorn lovers of the world . 
i bought a bowl to pop the corn in along with this popcorn and put two handsful in the bowl and set the microwave on popcorn but it needed more popping for all to pop , in fact almost twice as much time but the results are great br today we will get the seasoning i bought for it and look forward to using it to have a woderful snack while watching tv . 
popcorn is very good cant believe the difference between this popcorn and the regular stuff at the story a very good purchase . 
i liked the idea of the small popcorn it pops up really well in the popper but it does n't have much if any popcorn flavor was pretty bummed by that . 
i used to grow the japanese hulless in small quantities for my stovetop popper this is the closest i can find if you are appalled by the shipping cost , like i was , try looking elsewhere for a better deal for instance , one popular site offers 6 lbs for 11 95 with free shipping if you sign up for repeating shipments \( which you can cancel any time \) try www c king com . 
i have made this my popcorn of choice i enjoy the flavor and kernal size . 
get it , get it , get it ! this popcorn is truly the most tender , delicious popcorn i have ever tasted . 
got three different amish popcorn 's for my daughter 's birthday she is always on a diet , i got her the hot air popper same time she my grandson \( he 's 4 \) loved it she ate a bowl every night still lost 15 lbs ! ! not saying it 's a diet food , just satisfiing ! ! . 
i bought this popcorn as a gift for some dear friends the have commented back several times that it 's the best popcorn they have ever had they love it ! they had shopped in the dc metro area to find white popcorn and could never find it so one look on amazon was all it took to find this the best popcorn ever ! ! . 
i bought this for my daughter 's new microwave popcorn popper as a christmas gift , and she says that it is delicious , but pops up smaller than other popcorn she likes it a lot . 
this is very high qulity pop corn , i recomend it almost all kernels pop and they are a crisp white when they pop very healthy and yummy ! . 
pops fully , few spare kernels with the traditional stovetop method small , fluffy kernels , not a lot of 'misfires' that are only partially evolved my wife says they 're a tad too small for her taste , but the kids and i really love this popcorn . 
this popcorn brings me back to days before the microwave version what a treat it was to savor the taste and lightly salted lily white popcorn that was popped over the heat of a stove burner again . 
i love this brand , all kernels pop and they are a nice size , texture and flavor . 
i have not eaten this popcorn or tasted it myself , it was part of a gift for my daughter in grad school she likes the fluffy quality of the popped corn and the not so many hulls also the big bag makes her think she can make it last until christmas \( that remains to be seen \) without having to buy more a very good snack for a poor grad student . 
i'm a huge popcorn fan and have tried all sorts , and the amish country brand popcorn is the best i 've ever eaten absolutely delicious ! . 
there are very seldom any unpopped kernels , which is nice and the flavor is wonderful not a whole lot to say about popcorn i always buy from you guys and will continue to . 
i love white corn , in all its forms , including popcorn and i hate how outrageously expensive the kernels are in the supermarket , so i love this popcorn . 
i enjoy it practically every evening , it is very good popcorn , not as much hulls and small when popped . 
this popcorn is much smaller than your average popcorn , and it is virtually hulless that is exactly what i was looking for in a popcorn because my 3 year old loves popcorn with 3 year old children , you have to be concerned with the hulls causing choking or hurting their tender gums my son has no trouble eating this popcorn it is soft and light , does n't get stuck in your teeth nearly as much , and has a great flavor br br this is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family i usually pop it in my 10 year old cheap hot air popper with no problems i get very few unpopped kernels another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping , but i have not experienced this problem \( it could depend on the popper , i suppose \) i have tried microwaving it in a paper bag , but i always seem to end up burning it i think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right , so i just stick with my hot air popper i get great popcorn every time ! . 
i bought this with the whirly pop popcorn popper , and i made some as soon as i got them it is the best popcorn i 've had i thought i would mind the smaller kernel size , but i did n't there is substantially less hull than regular popcorn the flavor is great i suggest using peanut oil for popping popcorn it gives popcorn a great nutty taste really delicious you can buy peanut oil at any oriental \( asian \) store it 's better than olive oil \( olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me \) but peanut oil is perfect you wo n't need butter flavor or anything like that again \( artificial butter flavorings are full of chemicals \) now , we pop around three times a day and always crave this for a snack instead of junkfood try it and you 'll be popping like us . 
this is delicious popcorn lost a star because i use a hot air popper and many of them jump out before popping great flavor , great texture tender i do not add anything even though i have purchased three different flavored toppings br br thanks , . 
got this for like 10 on a warehouse deal it was a bargain ! i received them in early may and the label says best before june at a rate of one can per 2 3 days , i do n't think i 'll have a problem finishing them off before june \( i know , i have a sweet tooth \) all 4 cans had some dents on them but the condition of the gulab jamun inside was good they were just as described soft cheese balls \( about 20 per can \) in a sugar syrup with just a hint of cardamom warm it up a before eating for the maximum flavor and texture . 
why is this when the same product is available for here \? br http www amazon com victor fly magnet bait refill dp b00004rbdy br br the victor m380 and m502 traps are unreal , of course total fly genocide pretty stinky , but only right nearby . 
we have used the victor fly bait for 3 seasons ca n't beat it great product ! . 
bar harbor clam chowder is absolutely fantastic ! br br 1 i am not usually a fan of soup out of the can br 2 i am really picky about my clam chowder br br that said , i get this stuff in bulk there are several reasons for this , the first of which is the great flavor of clams and potatoes second , i like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and , third , that one can adjust the level of creaminess and viscosity with what one adds to the soup \( i like to use a mixture of milk and cream \) the fourth plus is that this soup contains neither bacon nor excessive amounts of spice or pepper two things that ruin clam chowder for me i know bacon is popular with a lot of folks but i really just want to taste the clams when i have a bowl of new england clam chowder if you 're like me in that respect , then i think you will like this soup too ! br br p s as a child , i was a fan of friendly 's clam chowder \( before they changed their recipe \) bar harbor is even better ! . 
i 've definitely had a stigma against canned anything \( and still do \) picked this up at the supermarket , drawn by the all natural ingredients \( for once no msg or really anything else i did n't recognize \) it 's really quite good , and especially so for coming out of a can i can have excellent clam chowder and with a little milk and butter , exactly to my liking warm within minutes one of the few canned goods i keep in my cabinet , and one of the most convenient and surprisingly satisfying meals always 5 minutes away br highly recommended . 
this is our preferred clam chowder we like the natural taste with lots of potatoes the only complaint is i think the soup can be creamier amazon has much better price on this with subscribe and save . 
it 's not as good as i hoped , but canned chowder never is i added some butter , a can of chopped clams , and some milk then thickened it a bit it works great as a base , but not for me straight out of the can .

this is the best clam chowder ever come originally where this is produced and was so happy when i found it on line keep this in my cupboard at all time being an old maine girl this is my favorite chowder of all times . 
the best canned clam chowder i 've found currently available very light , nicely seasoned , creamy taste not fishy or oniony good amount of minced clams per serving to find better chowder , it would have to be homemade . 
this is clearly the best canned clam chowder i have tasted it is refreshing to have a canned soup without all the unnecessary preservatives and artificial flavoring the can is supposed to be condensed , but if you like a hearty thick soup , it is better just heated without adding milk or water the clams are perfect , and not over cooked i will order again , and look forward to trying out some of the other products they have on amazon . 
i used to be a buyer at a natural organic grocery this is the best soup i have ever had in a can i am very picky about my clam chowder soup as my favorite is the ritz carlton 's clam chowder just add butter , milk cream , and black pepper have some fresh corn bread and butter and you are in heaven . 
for canned soup this is very good clam chowder those who give it 1 or 2 stars are comparing it to homemade soup or restaurant style soup i would buy this any day over other brands you can tell it is all natural and without loaded msg , salt and other nasty ingredients pure and clean soup those who rate it badly , some say it has no flavor or there are n't chunks in it the flavor is mild , but that is good not overwhelmingly clammy and not over salted like conventional brand canned soup if i want to , next time i will add a potato cut up in chunks to boost it 's contents not a big deal to do i would prefer to do that than buy a conventional brand that does n't care about healthy ingredients and sourcing of ingredients i will buy this again good source of iron as well . 
even though the chowder is very very good as is i add a can of the bar harbor chopped clams to it along with a can of heavy cream and a huge pat of 'budda' br br yummy . 
i adore this chowder because it uses natural ingredients and not harmful fillers like msg and partially hydrogenated oil most importantly , this chowder tastes mouth watering good and is bursting with flavor i use whole milk and add a pinch of pepper , and this aromatic chowder is devoured in minutes if you have not already , definitely give it a try . 
unless you 've got a clam roller somewhere on your property , i doubt seriously that you could whip up a better bowl of chowder ! the clams were tender , fresh , plentiful , and remarkably non gritty the 'taters' were tasty and not overly done i would recommend that they cut back a bit on the tapioca starch and add some medium cream , instead i like to add some diced vidalya onion or red bell pepper stir in some milk , butter , and black pepper , and you 're on your way to a delightful meal . 
this soup lacks the key ingredients that make a canned clam chowder great partially hydrogenated vegetable oils \( soy cottonseed \) , dehydrated potatoes , modified starches of all kinds , hydrolyzed corn gluten , msg , potassium chloride , sodium phosphate , disodium inosinate , disodium guanylate , and succinic acid what good is a classic new england clam chowder without these classic ingredients \? br br instead , the first ingredient listed is clams next you 'll be telling me it 's got butter in it \( it does \? oh \) br br on a more serious note bar harbor makes a good tasting clam chowder the first list of ingredients came from snow 's and campbell 's condensed new england clam chowders this bar harbor stuff is worth it . 
good flavor and not too rich fewer fat calories than the standard fare it 's not loaded up with canola oil like campbell 's and progresso , so you can add a little quality evoo like california olive ranch , or even butter for a healthier brew if you prefer it that way like we do i also add a little half and half , and saute some hormel bacon bits with red onion and garlic to add complexity to the flavor i was impressed i usually also add some gorton 's wild pacific salmon \( frozen , in most markets \) to basically make it a healthy fish chowder . 
very good clam chowder not as good as being in maine in a restaurant but much better then other canned chowders . 
bar harbor clam chowder is an excellent product easy to fix and has tremendous flavor , nice amount of clams and potatoes you will enjoy this product very well ! . 
this arrived earlier than expected , which was great ! however , for some reason , this particular product smelled a little like fish food but no worries , still tasted like great cashew butter , just the smell was kinda weird like fish food also , i wish this product was organic . 
my dog likes the iams savory sauce it helps to tempt him to eat when his appetite is off , and it 's good for him . 
i had read another review and the reviewer was concerned about this product coming from china i called the manufacturer and was told this product is made here in the us my dog loves them ! ! . 
this is a new treat for our kids they are pretty picky eaters , especially my girl ! they both love 'em glad i found this product reasonably priced too . 
i have a german breed , g sheph he is very , very , picky ! he loved them he is such a happy camper he wakes up in the morning ready to go for his walks comes home straight to his treat cabinet , he wants his chicken stix thank you , finally something that my boy loves . 
i eat a lot of cereal , and that includes a lot of the high fiber kinds oatmeal , mini \( frosted \) shredded wheat and raisin bran are usually what i 'd eat when i needed to lose a few lbs , but there have been a few instances where i tried the healthier options i 've tried several of the kashi cereals , but they were n't very appetizing the plain one had a cardboard taste next , i tried grape nuts , which is like a horrendous yeast flavored cat food \( though it 's closer to kitty litter in texture \) that brings me to fiberplus antioxidants br br this berry yogurt crunch is certainly one of the better tasting high fiber cereals i 've eaten it 's like a decent health bar broken apart into cereal the clusters of yogurt really help , but even the plain cereal is decent enough on its own yes , there are 12g of sugar per serving , but the 10g of fiber and 170 calorie parts more than make up for it especially if you compare it to raisin bran and frosted shredded wheat , which are typically higher in sugar and calories , yet lower in dietary fiber the antioxidants are a nice bonus , too br br the bottom line is that i 'll add this to my grocery list whenever it 's on sale or the price is right . 
let me first say that i do n't eat cereal as a general rule i just do n't like it i do n't drink milk ever , so eating dry cereal is n't always a treat i purchased a box of this for my husband i ended up trying some because it just looked so pretty in the bowl and i was hooked ! this cereal is tasty and healthy and i eat it everyday now with my yogurt i ca n't give it enough stars ! . 
i am now on my third box of this delicious cereal i try to eat only high fiber cereals , mainly for nutrition but also because they seem to be more filling this is now my favorite ! if you purchase the fiber plus bars , many times they have a 1 coupon on the back \( off one box of cereal \) i buy mine from wal mart 2 68 and use coupon great deal usually lasts me a week i eat a bowl everyday also , many times you 'll find a 1 coupon on cereal box for fiber bars they are pretty good too , especially the chocolate almond . 
my daughter , living and working in dc this summer , introduced me to this product while home for a visit she encouraged me to give the plain version \( just pure coconut water \) a chance first , and by the second container , i understood the amazing qualities of this drink i felt so refreshed , hydrated , and healthy ! i later tried the kind with pineapple , which is also delicious , but i think the plain is more effective and purely refreshing when really hot , tired and thirsty , while the sweeter fruit infused version will be amazing as part of a cocktail ca n't wait for 5 00 ! . 
this has been my favorite brand of coconut water of the ones i 've tried they use real fruit juice for flavoring , as well as it tastes good br br we tried the smaller size , and they just are n't large enough to get enough water at the gym , and are not resealable br br things i like about this br br perfect size for an hour long gym routine br resealable cap \( smaller one lacks this \) br tasty \( like a pina colada \) br br negative br br box makes it hard to get the last drops usually end up squishing it up to get the last bit br br so great coconut water , perfect size , and cheaper than buying locally at sprouts with the amazon 's 'subscribe and save' ! . 
i like the slight pineapple flavor in this better than the plain coconut water good well chilled coconut water is supposed to be a healthy drink . 
love this juice scheduled shipment is convenient and economical this is a very expensive beverage and any way to save some money on it , is worth it . 
i have tried every brand of coconut water that health food stores carry , and this is , by far , my favorite the pineapple flavor does not overwhelm the coconut or vice versa i also like the tetra pack with the screw on top it is much more convenient than the smaller 11 oz size which you cannot reseal this has been a great gatorade substitute for me , and helps a lot when i am sick or dehydrated or need to hydrate quickly great stuff ! . 
shipping great and loved product the boxes are a little tough because there is not a lid if you do not finish i suggest buy only little ones this way . 
i discovered vita coco a few months ago of the flavors i have tried , i like the pineapple best it tastes like a mild pina colada without the alcohol i love the idea of an all natural hydrating drink that is low in sugar and high in potassium whenever i am hot , thirsty or a little run down , i find that vita coco coconut water with pineapple really quenches my thirst , refreshes me , and gives me a little energy boost without added sugar or any artificial ingredients like the ones in gatorade and other drinks aimed at balancing electrolytes an 8 1 2 ounce serving has only 60 calories and 30 mg of sodium \( less than fat free milk \) , with 515 mg of potassium and 180 of the rda of vitamin c it 's a little pricey , but if you can buy it on sale with free shipping , it 's a great value although i have previously purchased it on amazon , i more recently bought it at gnc during gold card week when there was a free shipping offer and a buy 2 , get 1 free offer with a deal like that , it breaks down to less than 65 cents per 8 1 2 oz serving . 
pineapple is hands down my favorite flavor of vita coco ! it not only serves a great electrolyte replenishing beverage \( aka the perfect hangover cure \) but it can also be made into a pinacolada if you just add some rum \) . 
i really like this coconut water , but i was surprised that per 17oz box it 's the same price at wegman 's probably wo n't be ordering again unless there 's some sort of discount . 
heard about this drink from a friend and had to try it had one while traveling and loved it ! ! ! i sat on the plane enjoying it i was thinking , i should bought another one ! . 
i tasted the pineapple flavor yesterday at a friend 's cocktail party she used it to mix with rum to make pina coladas it complimented the drink so well ! ! the bottles are really pretty to set up and hand out at a party as well \) br br i have been drinking vita coco for a while now and usually drink the 100 pure , but i find the flavors to be such a treat \( yet still very healthy \) ! especially after a long workout . 
it 's high quality and the price is right , especially with subscribe and save via prime , but after months of trying to keep up with my subscription , i had to put it on hold i'm not a big water drinker , but this stuff has a distinct flavor and when you 're using it as a work out beverage four or five times a weak it eventually wears on you or me , at least i 'd still recommend it , just do n't od the way i did . 
originally i was turned of by this product when i tasted the regular flavor once i had the version with pineapples , i was instantly hooked i used to get a lot of stomach cramps and cramps in my feet since i have incorporated this drink daily it has aided my digestive system and obliterated all of my previous cramp problems i would recommend vita coco to all of my friends and family . 
of all the flavors vita coco produces , the pineapple combination is by far the best it has just enough flavor to keep it interesting but not overpowering . 
the pineapple coconut combination is refreshing i especially like that there is no added sugar this is a welcomed change from other brands . 
i like this product so much i have it delivered monthly ! so happy to be drinking this at work while my co workers are stuck with pop ! it 's so refreshing and revitalizing ! the only coconut water flavor i like is pineapple ! transports easily and stores easily with the screw on top . 
i always feel refreshed when i drink this coconut water the pineapple gives it an added extra that makes it truly irresistible it has been a firm favorite of mine now for nearly a year . 
i tried quite a few varieties of this brand and the pineapple is the best light but refreshing i am not sure if i think it is a miracle elixer or anything but i did purchase a case and look forward to drinking this on a regular basis thank you for the great value and convenience , amazon . 
i use vita coco coconut water with pineapple to mix with my ultra meal nutritional supplement it mixes well and taste great i have it for breakfast every morning . 
if you have n't had coconut water with pineapple juice before then you need to try this ! simply delicious and so healthy for you ! . 
bigger is always better , and that is not what she said , i did i got turned on to coconut water about a year ago and since then have not been able to get enough of it i found that vita coco , is the best brand around the pineapple flavor has a great sweetness that compliments the coconut water to create a refreshing , thirst quenching beverage i have recently began to drink more due to the nature of my job so i do n't cramp up in my hands plus with all the nutrients and benefits , whats there not too like with subscribe and save , i can quench my thirst any time of year thanks vita coco , you surely have a lovely bunch of coconuts ! ! ! . 
i love the taste of the viva coco with pineapple if i was likening it to a common drink , it 's a melted virgin pina colada br the 17 oz boxes are better for me than the other sizes , because they contain the resealable lids in case you do n't drink it all at once br as with all coconut waters , the taste can vary slightly , but the pineapple seems to keep it pretty consistant . 
good thirst quencher milky and thicker then i expected not what i would call a pineapple flavor but one can get the idea it is pineapple . 
i love the pineapple coconut water it is high in potassium i am a rural mail carrier and have to be out in the hot weather in the afternoon i get hot , dry , and thirsty i am trying to lose weight so i'm watching my calories water is wet and cold but does n't quench my thirst this stuff does the trick it quenches my thirst and gives me a little pick up for the afternoon and keeps me going this only has 60 calories per serving , so that is much less than a 180 calorie gatorade i recommend this to those looking for a healthy alternative to the sugary sports drinks . 
i love the pineapple the best had a hard time finding this at the store , they get ya hooked and then stop carring it i have tried the other brands of coconut water but i'm just not loving them , so i went online hoping to find this brand and there it was now mom 's happy and so is everyone else ! love the vita coco ! . 
short and brief the product has a wonderful coconut taste and the pineapple addition is light and mildly sweet i will certainly purchase this again . 
i 've always wanted to like coconut water low in calories , high in minerals but i 've just never liked the taste much the pineapple juice in this really makes a difference it still needs to be well chilled to be good , but it makes a healthy post workout drink . 
i love buying these and drinking them after my workout you lose not just fluids but minerals vitamins and this helps replenish you water is good too for you too but i just love these post workout they are also good for anytime when you could use a sweet but natural drink \( like you do n't want milk or soda or water but want something tasty and refreshing \) . 
after reading about the benefits of coconut water , i decided to give this brand a try i have tried a few other brands with a juice added , but they all have lot of extra sodium be sure to read the labels some have less potassium in them than the via coco brand i felt like this was better for my husband to drink than gatorade he works on a c during the summer and is out in the heat all day long . 
love the pineapple flavor makes me feel like i am on vacation drinking a pina colada \( you probably could add a little rum and \) really tastes better than other pineapple coconut waters i have tried ! ! . 
this product is a good addition to fruit smoothies it thins it out while adding good taste and electrolytes , which are good during the very hot weather . 
i love this water ! i started buying it after my bikram yoga classes to rehydrate , and now drink it whenever i feel a little dehydrated living in az , i tend to not drink enough water so these help tremendously and are delicious too ! try them ! you 'll be hooked \) . 
vita coco water is taste great by itself or mixed up in a smoothie it is great for re hydration after a workout and has more potassium than a banana . 
it says on the box each drink contains the potasium of 2 bananas more electrolites than a sports drink they might seem a little high priced but go to groecery store buy 2 bananas 2 sports drinks and you will pay more to get the same nutrition you get from 1 juice box of this coconut water . 
great before , during , and after a workout great natural electrolytes , very high in potassium , amazing drink ! this is my favorite flavor , tangerine is 2nd . 
great real coconut young coconut taste not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks good on the environment made in brazil even better you can really taste the fruit labelled on the product besides the coconut water taste . 
not only does vita coco have the best taste much better than one br and slightly better than zito , but now they have the best package br also ! ! br br this new screw top is great to take to the gym , hiking and biking br br coc water is the best re hyrator and imo vita coco is the best br i also noticed when i searched coconut water on amazon com that br vita coco comes up number one , so others seem to think that vita br coco is number one also because they are voting with thier purchases . 
i'm so addicted to these ! ! ! you know the movie when harry met sally \? when i drink one of these it just feels like that famous scene in the movie orgasmic ! . 
high quality coca products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags br organic coca tea bags do not contain preservatives or additives therefore they must be properly stored all coca tea air tight bags are re sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry , cool , dark place away from strong flavored foods an extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month br do not store coca tea products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside many fruits and vegetables , especially if they have been damaged , give off ethylene gas as they ripen coca tea bags are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas the refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties , allowing it to build up to damaging levels although not hazardous to humans , the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea . 
i got a bag with 25 oinkies , pig skin with sweet potato in the middle but my dogs like them despite the wrong item being received it 's still made by hartz the description of this product did n't say anything about sweet potato in the center so unless they update the description package image i got the wrong product i'm only happy because my doggies are p . 
these are a great snack for any dog who has food allergies to chicken my 20 pound sheltie loves them more than any other chew or rawhide that we have given her i highly recommend these for any dog , especially one with food allergies . 
i have an old english sheepdog he absolutely loved the treats it took him longer than i thought it would to eat through one so i could eat a treat in peace while he chewed on his it was great . 
my dog craves these one each morning she 's never had digestive problems with them , unlike the beef rawhide bones which we wont give her we couldnt find them suddenly in any of the stores and i was soooo delighted amazon had them ! right to my door quick ! thank you amazon ! . 
wrigleys' 5 flare sugarless gum is wrigleys' sugarless replacement for their big red cinnamon gum 5 flare seems to be difficult to find in stores thanks to amazon i always have a supply 5 flare is also the longest lasting gum i have ever experienced both in flavor and durability it is positively the best cinnamon flavor currently on the market . 
i love this gum it is very dishearting that it is so difficult to find i was hooked on the cinnamon extra until that went away now this item is not available this world needs more cinnamon lovers . 
i tried this gum after trident cinnamon became hard to find a couple of years ago \( trident told me that they were overhauling the plant that made the gum so it was in short supply but it would be back \) i quickly discovered that the flare 5 was far superior to the trident and i have n't looked back it does last a long , long , long , time unfortunatley , as other reviewers noted , it has become very hard to find in stores trident cinnamon is everywhere but now i do n't want it amazon saves the day again . 
i found this coffee flavorful and bold i did n't experience bitterness br br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano br br my favorite k cups are br starbucks french roast br starbucks caffe verona br starbucks pike place roast br green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve br green mountain double black diamond br green mountain revv br green mountain dark magic br br other k cups i 've tried coffee people jet fuel , green mountain dark magic decaf , emeril jazzed up decaf , starbucks caffe verona , coffee people black tiger , starbucks house blend , starbucks breakfast blend , starbucks sumatra , wolfgang puck french roast , green mountain lake and lodge , green mountain french roast , caribou mahogony , wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya , emeril big easy bold . 
is so good lots of flavor and great coffee taste especially good to wake up with enjoy this coffee i give it a plus 10 . 
i love how fast my cups arrived i will always get my k cups here ! i ca n't wait to try something new . 
we have several of these machines at work and i 've tried lots of different flavors and blends this is one of the few i can keep down without my body convulsing with an involuntary shudder lots of these instant coffees are very bitter or far too strong this one is actually very tasty . 
i 've tried a handful of other brands of french roast and i find this one and tully 's version to be both great and comparable in flavor the difference is the price \( this one is far more reasonable \) . 
i have had green mountain coffee before , but had not tried the french roast i am just realizing that there is a taste difference between different manufacturers , even with the same types of roasts the green mountain french roast has the flavor i like and was expecting the price was reasonable and my order shipped quickly my only disappointment was in the shipping packaging i knew that i was ordering 2 boxes of k cups but was surprised to see how big the shipping box was there was room for 3 boxes , with the extra space filled with bubble wrap , which seems wasteful to me but on the whole , i am very happy with my coffee ! . 
this coffee has a nice bold flavor , not too strong , but smooth and bold enough that you know your having a wakeful , full bodied cup of coffee that is really enjoyable if you like a distinctive , medium bold cup of coffee you will love this . 
one of the best choices so far if you like bold coffee you will like this one will definitely buy again . 
i prefer stong coffee but my husband does not like it quite so strong it works well for me the way he made it work for him , he makes a cup and a half and that suits him it also makes the kcup last twice as long ! . 
out of curiosity i compared with side by side with tully 's french roast k cups these green mountain k cups do not have quite the full bodied flavor of tully 's both k cups are good , but if you 're going after a french roast with the most full spectrum and thickness of flavor then i 'd recommend tully 's french roast k cups . 
french roast my green mountain is my favorite every day k cup its a good coffee bold yet smooth not burnt \( i hate peets and starbucks because they taste like the burn the beans \) if you like the nasty burnt taste , these probably are not for you if you want a well balanced , bold , smooth everyday coffee these k cups will work ! . 
this is great french roast for whatever reason , it is also cheaper \( in 24 count \) than the other green mountain coffee roasts . 
i find many k cups are weak and not what i am used to \( starbucks \) , but this french roast is a pretty good subsitute to the 2 coffee i get from the store . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b000f9z1ws planters peanut butter cookie crisps 100 calorie packs , 6 count boxes \( pack of 6 \) a these cookies are so tasty ! i love the peanut taste and the crispness a one hundred calorie pack is just enough to get started having fun eating them , but then the limitation of the size of the package helps me put the brakes on probably the most important part of weight control is portion control br br the cookies have 3 grams fat , 0 mg cholesterol , and 2 weight watchers points . 
i enjoy them a lot and so does my son i have to say that this kind is one of my favorites it is full of peanut butter flavor that you forget that it is only 100 cals as for the amount you get in the bag , it is more than i expecting so i was very happy . 
i enjoy the peanut butter cookie crisp , but they are definitely a departure from the originals still my son loves them so for this reason i still give it four stars . 
one reviewer writes that these are oreo crackers without the creme and they are right ! these thin oreo crisp wafer type cookies by nabisco are easy to pack for when you 're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion they also make for snacking anytime of the day or night and they give you that great oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient br br these crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free hooray ! there are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat they are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy french fries these crackers somehow manage to give you the full oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories , too excellent ! br br these oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy this makes them even more portable for both children and adults another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre measured to contain only 100 calories this way you ca n't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have br br i notice that these crackers are made with cocoa please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that br br i recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack they should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy they make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and or cholesterol br br buy some and enjoy them today ! smiles . 
i really like these they are so light and airy , almost like chips instead of cookies ! the flavor is that yummy oreo chocolate we all know and love ! . 
these are good but the flavor did not resemble an oreo i purchased these along with the chips ahoy and those did resemble the flavor of chips ahoy in my opinion these tasted like animal crackers i will stick to chips ahoy 100 calorie packs . 
i have been eating the 100 calorie chip ahoy for sometime i really find that it is a filling , guilt free snack it has a unique taste of its own not a `diet' food type taste either , it taste like a `real' snack . 
as i get older and fatter , i seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods however , oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief not only are oreo cookies delicious , but i sometimes think i hear oreo cookies calling my name as i walk by them honest i am unable to buy oreo cookies because if i do i know i will eat them generally in a few days not a good idea br br nabisco , realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods , have created a brand identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat , creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker to this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie however , this wafer snack , which nabisco has decided not to call a cookie , perhaps because cookie sounds fattening , is reasonably yummy i have eaten these things several times and still eat them i actually eat them more than regular oreos , which i count as quite a nod to health br br you may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie if you are going to add the fat and calories in icing , perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular oreo cookies in fact , just revel in the calories and go for the double stuff oreos br br oreos have been around since 1912 , and remain the best selling cookie brand in history according to our friends at kraft , which owns nabisco , and which is owned by the altria group \( renamed from philip morris , presumably for marketing reasons \) , more then 450 billion oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence though oreo thin crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing , they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the oreo name br br of course , you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy , but where is the fun in that \? for those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun , and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system , oreo thin crisps are a lovely alternative or course , you probably should avoid eating pounds of these , even with the reduced fat food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you , even if it tastes good at least oreo thin crisps do not talk to me when i walk by br br enjoy ! . 
we are still six years away from the centennial for the oreo cookie , which was first manufactured by nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the english tend to use \( it was copyrighted as the oreo biscuit \) the sandwich cookie was quite similar to the hydrox cookie produced by sunshine , but oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making hydrox back in 1996 what would be considered the modern oreo cookie was developed in 1952 \( originally they were mound shaped , which is why some think the name comes from the greek word for hill \) , with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the cream in between br br of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition oreo cookie there are oreos with chocolate flavored cream instead of the traditional white , as well as orange colored cream at halloween and red at christmas you can get oreos with a double portion of filling , not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling \( carmel and chocolate , coffee and cream , peanut butter and chocolate , etc \) you want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge \? they have that , or with white chocolate fudge in winter , and then there is the uh oh ! oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed br br but what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating \? after all , once they are open they could go stale , and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness nabisco has taken a three prong approach for weight watching oreo lovers you can go with the reduced fat oreo , which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving then there are the mini oreos , bite sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays now we can add to that short list the oreo thin crisps br br these are baked chocolate six sided wafer snacks , almost 20 to a pack , that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream now , i am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer , so i was wary because i thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream , but they are lighter in taste than that , even without having the glass of milk handy that i considered essentially when eating the more traditional oreo cookies since they do have the oreo taste i can round up on these these come in 100 calorie packs , to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake you can six 0 81 oz \( 23g \) packs in a 4 86 oz box each pack contains 0 grams of trans fat , 2 grams of fat , and 0 milligrams of cholesterol you will also find one of 100 healthy living tips on the front of the pack \( e g , 56 make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees \) of course , i was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream , but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit . 
love this snack br its really tasty br filling for my wife , not me though i 'll take 2 please \) . 
how good these cookies really are they 're delicious , satisfying , and really , really healthy definitely a great alternative to real cookies . 
first thoughts brings back old memories br br when i recently tried these little wafers i recalled when i worked in an office nearly 20 years ago whenever the director skipped lunch , he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 o'clock he usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer i came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him i guess they really admired him these 'nabisco oreo thin crisps , baked chocolate wafer snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines , but i would rather he have more of his old favorites br br in a nutshell nice for a dieter at coffee break time but no cream sugar please br br basically , this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in between meals and they do n't want it to be a 600 calorie confection that 's why the biggest print on the label says , 100 calorie packs 4 5 inches across ! br br what's this stuff all about enriched flour sugar artificial flavors artificial colors a little canola oil br br 2 grams of fat 9 grams of sugar in a 23 gram package 100 calories br br bottom line no pretenses simple lean sugar wafer with the usual additives br br as diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you one can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand , making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack for that purpose this is a great product and i know that our director , 20 years ago , would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon when the director did n't find any saltines around the office he 'd head straight for mcdonalds and the rest was history . 
i hate to admit i miss the lard i was the one in your 4th grade class who unscrewed the oreo , ate all the white middle , licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers that 's the image i have of this cookie even barbra streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of a star is born the oreos because she had two back up singers who were black that 's why the idea of an oreo thin crisp is rather lost on me br br it is a single , nickel sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached wheat thin than the original oreo it does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute do n't get me wrong , as the oreo thin crisps are perfectly fine as low calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go they simply lack the lip smacking satisfaction of a disassembled oreo digested in pieces the whole point of the 0 81 ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are 100 calorie packs , a fine idea for weight watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight it 's just that i do n't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack . 
nabisco knew if they didnt put little things that give this much pleasure in little baglets , we would keep dipping our hand in the bag and in a couple years would all weigh 400 lbs , die an early death and no longer be able to give nabisco money br br kidding aside , these are loveable the texture is perfection if you feel like chewing them quickly or take it slowly and let the light wafer melt in your mouth . 
when you have a craving for a sweet but you do n't wo n't too much , this bar is just perfect it 's yummy . 
i do n't usually like really crispy cookies , but the taste of these changed my mind i like that you get quite a few for only 100 calories i often go for quantity over quality so i would rather have a few thin crisp cookies than one regular cookie . 
these are our favorite indulgence at 100 calories for a sweet fix and energy they are the best ! sad to see on amazon they are no longer available \( br quick shipping and they arrived safely ! . 
these cookies are just enough when you crave a sweet little snack my 3 yr old granddaughter likes to say the letter br before she pops it in her mouth . 
these 100 calorie cakesters are delicious ! both the vanilla br and the chocolate are great , they satisfy those little sweet br cravings and its only 100 calories for three little cakes ! . 
let me begin by saying that i do not like oreo cookies at all i think the cookie part is bitter and i hate the white cream filling when a friend suggested i try these i was reluctant and kept telling her that i was not interested she insisted so i tried a few and surprisingly did not find them to be bad at all i'm diabetic , so this is not a snack i will be eating often , but a few here and there wo n't hurt if you 're expecting these to taste like oreo cookies \( i'm one who 's glad they did n't ! ! \) , then you 'll be disappointed but if you want a chocolate snack that 's low in calories and fat please give these a try . 
growing up on oreos and milk is common so i was taken aback with the brand extension of oreo 's to cakesters and while i had low expectations , i must say these are better than normal oreos although i ca n't say it 'll beat the combo of oreos and milk , these are fantastic treats and relatively guilt free if you like cake and like oreos you ca n't go wrong with oreo cakesters br br the filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new oreo experience certainly worth a try guaranteed enjoyment ! . 
i have recently joined jenny craig as i need to lose some weight , and these 100 calorie pack cookies are the greatest thing for snacks i appreciate the opportunity to get them from you so reasonably i have agreed to take a shipment each month . 
i loved the original oreo cakesters when they first debuted but , i shied away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving so , when i saw the commercial for the 100 calorie version , i could hardly wait to try them , and i must say i am very impressed ! br br while some of the 100 calorie snack cakes can have a dry , mealy consistency , these cakes are moist , decadent and taste 100 like the originals just smaller i would recommend them to anyone who liked the original version , but is watching calories good job nabisco ! . 
my family is on the last box my oldest daughter ate most of the cookies she likes peanut butter more than anything , and these 100 calorie pouches had just the right amount and they taste great . 
these are more like a cracker good for a little fill in for between meals . 
super yummy ! really hits the spot when i want a chocolatey snack that wo n't break the calorie bank . 
such an easy way to buy calorie controlled snacks the arrived quickly so easy to take to work or when you need just an easy snack . 
i absolutely love the oreo thin crisps cookies a href http www amazon com gp product b000f9z1wi oreo thin crisps 100 calorie packs , 6 count boxes \( pack of 6 \) a they taste great and satisfy my chocoholic craving without compromising my diet . 
of all the 100 calorie pack snack products i 've tried \( and there have been many ! \) these are my absolute favorites the funny thing is that i do n't even like oreos , and am not that crazy about chocolate however , these thin crisps are exactly that , thin and crisp they are also just right to fend off sweet cravings or premature hunger . 
they melt in your mouth ! i think i found my perfect snack br i love oreos , but hate all the fat they provide to my diet by diet i mean the ability to eat everything in moderation i monitor how much fat i ingest for many reasons , health being the most important one package of these cookies had the same great taste of oreos with only 1 4 of the fat br i also like the fact that they come in individual packages they do n't go stale you can take them on trips , movies , park , etc br great tea or coffee cookies too ! and , of course , good old milk . 
i hate to admit i miss the lard i was the one in your 4th grade class who unscrewed the oreo , ate all the white middle , licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers that 's the image i have of this cookie even barbra streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of a href http www amazon com gp product b000ayel1a a star is born a the oreos because she had two back up singers who were black that 's why the idea of an oreo thin crisp is rather lost on me br br it is a single , nickel sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached wheat thin than the original oreo it does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute do n't get me wrong , as the oreo thin crisps are perfectly fine as low calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go they simply lack the lip smacking satisfaction of a disassembled oreo digested in pieces the whole point of the 0 81 ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are 100 calorie packs , a fine idea for weight watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight it 's just that i do n't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack . 
dude , these things are pretty good as long as you 're not bent on them being just like oreos i mean , they 're not but i definitely like them better than other chocolate cracker snacks like teddy grahams the lightness of the crackers makes them perfect for slathering on other goodies , like peanut butter , cream cheese , icing , pudding , melted chocolate . 
these are great snacks for traveling , such as , by airplane or car the cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker the cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble and for this reason a preferred treat br br the texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat the first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is , humm these are good ! this is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time . 
who does n't love oreo cookies \? many of us well remember after school snacks of oreo cookies and milk however , also for many of us those school days when we could eat all we wished and not gain an ounce are in the past so , it 's a special treat that brings back all kinds of good memories to find oreo thin crisps br br no , i was not one who pulled the cookie apart to lap the frosting , i just loved the chocolatey taste and that is all in these cookies less the unwanted cals they 're crispy , crunchy , chocolate wafers a wonderful comfort snack br br a high five for oreo thin crisps ! br br gail cooke . 
i was one of fifty families chosen to receive nabisco oreo mini cakesters for free to do a product review on once i received my nabisco oreo mini cakesters in the mail , i and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately br br the box of nabisco oreo mini cakesters comes with five individual packages each package is 100 calories in fact , the nabisco oreo mini cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved each 100 calorie package comes with three oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty three and one third calories br br the appearance of the nabisco oreo mini cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness they are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly when you put a nabisco oreo mini cakesters into your mouth , they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor in fact , they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake the nabisco oreo mini cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling is n't as easily tasted or rather it was n't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but i did n't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons br br my oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the nabisco oreo mini cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories he enjoyed eating them and even gave nabisco oreo mini cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in ! br br my youngest grandson is n't able to communicate effectively verbally \( he 's special needs \) but i considered his dedication to eating his nabisco oreo mini cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories br br i definitely give the nabisco oreo mini cakesters a thumbs up i believe that i really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of nabisco oreo mini cakesters that i ate i honestly did n't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so , i ate it but luckily i know that all i had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all ! br br i like the fact that the nabisco oreo mini cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack i found the thought comforting especially since i ate two packages of them ! i even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too ! ! i am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me i think the nabisco oreo mini cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you do n't want to overindulge br br if i have any complaint about the nabisco oreo mini cakesters , it would be that they are too small ! ! but since that is actually part of their appeal , i do n't consider their small size a problem br br i do recommend nabisco oreo mini cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you . 
i love oreos but hate the filling these prevent me from having to scape the filling out and they 're good for you calorie wise . 
these arrived in the middle of may and they have an expiration date of the first week of july this means i have to eat a lot of these in the next few weeks ! just beware if you 're planning on stocking up for the future the future will get here very soon with these ! br br it 's also interesting that the box inside the amazon box says for internal use only i'm not sure what that 's about ! . 
they all taste really good it comes in mango , strawberry , and red bean they are each individually wrapped so you only have to eat one at a time there are 20 of each flavor as well when i finish this canister i plan on buying another . 
you can find the sogo sweet rice mochi at costco now , just 7bucks sth a href http www amazon com gp product b0042tr2we sogo sweet rice cakes japanese style mochi assorted flavor cannister a . 
i got this after a mention in the ny times and immediately became an addict it 's a little hot but not too much , and it has an amazing depth of flavor a lot more than the plain version i use it in chicken salad to cut back on the amount of mayo , to add flavor to blah soups and as a substitute for a lot of the oil in salad dressings a little bit over steamed veggies and added to yogurt over baked potatoes \( instead of sour cream \) is also great . 
my aged cat has a very sensitive stomach and she cannot eat most cat foods available however , she has absoloutely no problems with this not once in all the months i 've been feeding her this has she ever vomited in any way not to mention she 's acting healthier and seems stronger on this brand br br and she easily eats this dry without having to add any wet food to make it palatable she clearly likes the taste br br all in all i highly recommend this to anyone with a senior cat . 
i do n't know why science diet is being referred to as junk food , as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market a lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be but regardless , my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine after some comparisons , science diet mature adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food both my cats , the younger one and the older \( 10 \) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it they both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them my younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy \) . 
this is the perfect food for my cat in fact , the only one she will eat wet or dry . 
a friend brought a bag of this tea back from a trip to taiwan , and shared it with his coworkers i was amazed when i drank my first cup the best word to describe the mouth feel is buttery it 's a wonderful , clear and elegant tasting tea i 've never had anything like it , and ca n't wait for it to become available everyone he shared it with wants to buy some a japanese friend who has been drinking green tea all her life said it was a special experience to taste this tea please offer it soon ! . 
best coffee i have ever tasted br br my wife , neighbors and friends are all crazy over jamaican me crazy ! ! ! br br you must try it ! ! ! . 
i love coffee anytime of day but sensibly i drink decaffienated coffee during afternoon and evening hours and a flavored coffee is a real treat but some can be overpowering this jamaican me crazy flavor not only suits my personality \( ha \) , it is very pleasing to the palate the flavoring is very subtle while allowing the full flavor of the coffee to be enjoyed and oh , the aroma is delicious ! both while grinding the beans and brewing the coffee i will definitely purchase this again . 
i was looking for a wheel you know , like the one sitting at the bar at a restaurant i wanted to offer some broken pieces along with olives , pepperoni , and some prosciutto all for a new years eve party well it was not a wheel thank goodness because it was half a wheel and at 20 pounds for the half wheel , 40 pounds would have been way too much the flavor was excellent , just enough of bite the creaminess of the cheese really came through and was a perfect balance i broke up the half wheel into thirds and decorated a tray with a cascading effect of broken pieces it was all well received with the choices of red wine there was more than enough , which has allowed me to enjoy the flavors for other favorite dishes for a couple of more weeks i am looking forward to ordering this again super bowl is right around the corner it is big , so make sure you can carry and store this quantity as far as cost , i thought it was a great deal since it seemed to have much less rind than what we purchase elsewhere the cost per pound may be average , but the amount of actual usable cheese is there with the great flavor . 
absolutely delicious have tried it on everything from meat and fish to scrambled eggs highly recommend it . 
i have started the extraction process less than a month ago , and so far it looks and smell wonderful waiting to try it i have put 6 oz in 1 75 liters of vodka and now have a beautiful brown fluid that as i stated earlier smells wonderful i plan on using the other 2 oz in some homemade vanilla frozen icecream etc . 
wifey bought these for me for christmas i used to work with a guy who would bring still warm home roasted peanuts to work after he left i wanted to try it myself these were great 25 minutes in the oven with one stir and they are done they taste better than any grocery store peanuts ever could i might shell some of them and try honey roasting too i see a lot of people boil them , what are boiled peanuts like \? you do n't see them up here in ri and i 've never tried them . 
same great taste as the honeybush tea bags , but so much more green ! thank you for packaging this in bulk ! . 
we use this in place of sugar for almost everything it has a light flavor , sort of similar to honey without the crystallization and the strong flavor the best part is the lack of sugar highs and crashes due to its lower glycemic index . 
i was truly amazed at how great this product is the flavor is everything that you can expect from a sweetner that is this pure ! i will be ordering it again and i will try the other flavors as well ! . 
buy these cookies you will not regret it br br they are , hands down , the best store bought chocolate cookies out there , and i buy every new brand that comes out \( from mrs fields to all the permuatations offerred by pepperidge farms \) br br these are much better than entenmann 's recent incarnation of new recipe chocolate chip cookies , the milk chocolate chip and soft baked chocolate chip cookies both of these newer cookie species are awful the milk chocolate tastes like rotting bananas and the cookie part tastes like all the other crappy store bought soft cookies out there br br in contrast , entenmann 's original recipe chocolate cookie is a mind blowing experience delicious dark chocolate chips and a soft mouth watering cookie with a unique but ineffable taste they seem to have perfected the ratio of flour to sugar , so that the cookie is delicious without weighing you down with excessive sugary sweetness \( this is again in contrast to their horrible new cookies \) br br i have absolutely no idea why entenmann 's decided to nearly eliminate their sales of the classical recipe and replace it with these disgusting brands it seems to have happened when the entenmann name was bought by a larger multinational company , so it was probably a money saving opportunity the original recipe cookies likely have expensive ingredients br br the only problem is they are so hard to find thank goodness they are now on amazon ! ! ! . 
i found wild thymes many years ago and have continued to use their products the lemon salad refresher is my favorite salad dressing , it is light , now cal , and very tasty excellent on any green or pasta salad and especially good on fresh heirloom tomatoes with fresh avocado slices yum ! their customer service is excellent and helpful , and the site shares some great recipes as well i'm a fan . 
i have purchased these though a local source for four dollars for a pack of eight if you are not sensitive to msg then these are a delicious alternative to other salty snacks the seasoning is tasty and the thin sheets of seaweed are lite and crispy ! i eat them two or three packs at a time 25 calories per love them ! . 
my little ones love seaweed and rice and this seaweed did not disappoint br other brands are too oily or salty or not enough this one though is just right br i would be buying it again and again . 
great for sushi , or for use with korean kim bob , or maybe just as a snack lightly salted , great crunch , and will support , rice , beef , pork , even fish br or a vegetable or two . 
i found this stuff to be very tasty , great with jasmine rice or just as a snack i do n't mind a little msg if it enhances the flavor . 
this coffee was really good been trying to find it in new york , but have n't been able to i think it 's worth the few extra bucks to get it delivered i 've ordered twice now and each time the coffee comes fresh and still very aromatic also , i think the caffeine content is pretty high , as i'm more awake on this brand then other brands like starbucks and fairway market brands . 
this is my family 's favorite brand of wheat free gluten free cake mix this brand is moist , tasty and closer to the traditional cake mixes people are used to namaste products are the best in my opinion of what 's available out there in health food stores try it ! you wo n't be disappointed . 
i added 3 tbsp of sugar and half tsp of pure vanilla and a pinch of alum free baking powder and coconut oil for oil and it came out soo good my son loved it i liked it too the fact that it 's all the major allergens free makes it better . 
excellent for gf not bad on it 's own but i have used it as a basis for coconut cake , pineapple upside down cake , tres leches cake and others . 
i think namaste gluten free spice cake mix is their best but vanilla cake is pretty good , too i especially like it with whipped cream and strawberry sauce with a dash of ground orange peel in my oven , the mix bakes better in muffin cups or a muffin pan than in a rectangular pan . 
i 've made these twice in cupcake form , topped with red jam and powdered sugar of course it does n't taste like a normal vanilla cake more grainy in texture , with a subtle sweetness , and some spice br but i think they are super tasty they did n't suffer from the weird chewy texture i often run into with rice flour based mixes also used energ egg replacer with no problem . 
i used this mix to make a 9x13 cake in a glass pan using grapeseed oil , spring water , and free range eggs i thought the cake had a nice flavor to it but it was not what i was expecting i was craving a white cake \( like wedding cake \) and went to my local store to find something wheat free , gluten free and dairy free i purchased this vanilla cake mix i think it is a very good mix i could n't really taste the vanilla flavor but thought it had a nice flavor the cake is yellow , dense \( but not like a pound cake \) and texture y like brown rice has more texture than white rice i thought the sweetness was just right i think i would purchase again but would make pineapple upside down cake with it . 
this mix allowed my little one to have cupcakes at his second birthday party they turned out great and with some homemade vanilla icing , they were a hit with everyone ! i even used ener g 's egg replacer to replace the multiple eggs the mix calls for one hint , bake for almost the maximum time on the directions they come out golden brown and moist . 
this tea is hard to find it was a joy to find it on amazon br br large package 6 full size boxes arrive all for enjoyment ! br br sugar plum is a delicious , sweet , warm , feel good tea reminding you of christmas it has that spice palate of warm hibiscus , barley , rosehips i think what i like most of all is the sweet aromatic taste one of those tastes that makes you feel taken care of a special treat when you are little like when mom or dad would make you hot coco or something you like that was so sweet and rare and only on those special occations br br i adore this tea and rather drink anyother tea br i am so happy to have found it ! . 
this tea makes me sleep better than sleepy time tea the taste is also pretty good i make mine very concentrated br with less than 3 ounces of hot water and i cover the mug top with a plate and wrap a towel around the whole thing br and let it sit for as long as i can before i drink it . 
this tea smells and tastes like christmas ! this has always been my family 's favorite tea for children 's \( and big kid 's \) tea parties . 
i began purchasing this tea years ago and looked forward to it each year for the past two years i was unable to locate it in my local stores so i was elated to find it at amazon it tastes like cinnamon and red candy apples to me i love it ! . 
so glad to have found this tea it 's my absolute holiday favorite ! thanks for the fast shipping too ! . 
br br celestial seasonings' sugar plum spice is a delightful holiday tea it contains hibiscus , roasted barley malt , roasted chicory root , rosehips , chamomile flowers , natural plum flavor with other natural flavors , ginger root , roasted carob , and cardamom it does not contain caffeine , so it 's technically an herbal tea br br celestial seasonings has been around a long time , and makes quality teas all of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings , all are certified kosher and none use irradiated botanicals , which i appreciate although they use natural flavors in their teas , these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits , spices and herbs , and never contain monosodium glutamate \( msg \) they use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing to remove the caffeine from green and black teas , they use a process called effervescent decaffeination \( using carbon dioxide \) celestial seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas br br on the package , celestial seasonings writes , take a sip of sugar plum spice and journey with us to the land of the sweets in tchaikovsky 's the nutcracker here you 'll find gingerbread houses , trees laden with sugar plums and days filled with sunshine this is the land of the sugar plum fairy , who is beautiful , gentle and kind we created this tea to pay tribute to her sugar plum spice is made with 100 natural herbs and the festive flavors of plum and spice , with just a hint of sweetness this tea is slightly sweet and full bodied , tasting just as you would expect from the description the cardamom and ginger give it a little zing each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and i only need to use one at a time br br i recommend it , even if it 's not a holiday it 's perfect for a cold or wet winter day br br . 
it 's hard to rate tea it 's very good tea , but tea nonetheless however , the company that sells this particular tea was very nice to deal with they shipped the tea very quickly i 'll most likely buy from them again when the need arises . 
the fortune cookies were shipped immediately and were packed well , i e none arrived broken the cookie was delicious and the fortunes were classic chinese \( and not the modern version \) . 
my daughter 's kindergarten class celebrated chinese new year and we were in charge of providing the fortune cookies this company had a prompt delivery and the cookies were a great success her teacher commented on how funny the fortunes were for the kindergartens . 
i brought these cookies as a dish to pass at my family christmas get together they were a hit the cookies were fresh , and unbroken packaging was well done , and delivery was prompt my sisters had fun with the fortunes , by adding the phrase , while in bed after reading each fortune br br i will use the amazon vendor , house of rice again . 
the cookies were kind of stail but other than that it was fast shipping and good packing the cookies were n't broken . 
my primary reason for ordering , was the picture had shown the cookies as green i will acknowledge that the important information heading listed a warning that the actual product may be different , compared to what was shown aside from the color problem , they were shipped quickly , and properly only one or two broken cookies on arrival , but it 's no big deal , i eat a few when they come in anyway i'm not sure what flavor they are , but they are delicious , as per the description if you 're not picky on color , good value . 
the cookie is crispy good and flavorful the fortunes are thoughtful , not the shallow ones we are seeing lately \( be patient , even in time an egg will walk \) i received the quantity and quality i ordered . 
i ordered these fortune cookies as rewards for my students each time they passed a multiplication test \( to go along with the theme fortunately we know our math facts \) the majority of the cookies arrived still in tact i understand that with shipping there are bound to be a few broken cookies i am very please with the product and the customer service i will definitely be ordering again in the future and will make sure i refer my family and friends to this business . 
i am very pleased with this product i almost did not buy them because they looked green on my computer , but when i received them they were the normal tan color that most of them are . 
this is the second time i have ordered this product i was happy enough the first time to place an order again cookies were fine and delivery was very quick thank you . 
well packed few are broken but it is understandable the cookies are tasty and the notes are interesting my friends and i really enjoyed it ! thx ! . 
great product , fast shipment , the food product tasted great none of the fortune cookies where opened i would buy again from this seller ! . 
i bought these as a gift for my sister , i was so excited to see that they arrived in great condition my sister loved them ! . 
these cookies were a big hit at our progressive new year 's eve dinner everyone enjoyed reading their fortune each time we arrived at another house they really kept the party moving . 
this is a great product , however , you can buy it in a salumeria in brooklyn , ny for 9 99 frank sal on 18th avenue brooklyn and i'm editing my review because amazon assigned me the profile name liar liar animals ! i was only stating a fact about what a rip off the site is in the future , amazonn please do n't call me a liar that 's not nice you stupid thieves . 
bought as a christmas present smells like a milk shake i might have to try it , might make a coffee drinker out of me ! . 
amazing ! my roommate brought this home because it was on sale and at first i just gave it a shrug within a week i was adding it to every combination of bread , peanut butter , muffins , sauces , meats i had in my kitchen guiltily apologizing to my roommate as i scooped and slathered away anything i added it to , even if it seemed strange was immediately transformed into something wonderfully delicious even sweetening my tea and coffee with it had me in bliss needless to say , the jar was emptied quickly i went back to the store to try stock up but they were all sold out and i have n't been able to find anything like it since please mackays ! bring your deliciousness back , i have a long life ahead of me and i 've only just discovered you ! ! . 
i bought this for my sister for christmas she loved it , but was afraid she 'd eat all of it at once , so she took the box to work within 1 hour , it was finished by all her interns ! . 
okay , not like the butter most people would expect , but a very smooth , full and slightly savory vegetal flavor the first time you take a sip , you might not notice it , but let it sit in your mouth a bit before swallowing and then take another sip the more you drink it , the more it will become apparent it is very soothing to the pallet br br jin xuan golden lily oolong from summit tea company it a good if not great tea , especially for the price and quantity you get a solid every day drinker it is not as complex as some that i 've had , but that could be due to how long ago it was harvested and a number of other conditions depending on how you brew it , a serving of these leaves is good for 4 5 infusions before the flavor wanes , making it an even better value and even then , the broth is soft and sweet br br if you like your oolongs more on the green side , then you should give it a try i know i 'll be ordering another tin . 
i eat these tuna cups \( or the salmon cups \) almost daily br br if you 're looking for a nutritious snack , these cups really ca n't be beat if you 're a bodybuilder or athlete trying to increase your daily protein intake , these are awesome if you 're a parent trying to get your kid to eat healthy , getting them to like fish is a great idea if you 're trying to eat 5 7 meals a day to lose weight , make one of these cups one of your meals , the protein fills you up and makes you feel good it also requires a bit of chewing to complete the eating experience br br why eat a nutritionally empty 100 calorie pack of goldfish crackers or potato chips when you could have something like this that has only 80 calories and infinitely more nutritional benefit \? \? br br i 'll eat these alone , straight from the cup , basically anywhere since you do n't need to refridgerate and you do n't need a can opener i 'll dump them onto salad , or mix with rice , quinoa , or beans br br here 's the nutrition data off the back \( for 1 2 7oz cup \) at the time of writing br br calories 80 \( 10 from fat \) br total fat 1g br cholesterol 35mg br sodium 15mg br total carb 0g br protein 18g br omega 3 epa dha 200mg br br you really ca n't beat this for something so portable that requires no preparation or refridgeration the package says in water but there 's a little bit of broth in the cup , and if you squeeze this out or just leave it at the bottom of the cup , you probably cut the sodium down to 10mg br br i highly recommend these tuna cups and the salmon cups as well but , avoid the tuna salad , or the flavored varieties if you are looking to get the maximum nutritional benefit those salads and flavorings just add salt , sugar , carbs . 
although i prefer to get my tuna in the foil packages , what i had ordered appears to no longer be available through amazon so i tried these and they are handy and pretty goo eating for one toss on a salad , or use on bread or toast to add good quality protein . 
cats are such finicky eaters some times my old lady kitty does not like the canned cat foods , but she always went nuts whenever i 'd open a can of tuna for myself so i gave her some one time these tuna cups are a great way to keep the tuna fresh enough over a few days , and good for travel br br same items can be purchased at grocery store , but buying in quantity through amazon saves some thank you . 
when i'm working , i always carry my own lunch it 's so much better than the food court , and i have much better regulation of my nutrient intake finding items having high protein without high fat is the most difficult task tuna is excellent and these little chicken of the sea white tuna cups fill the bill put one in the lunch with a few fresh fruit and veggie items and perhaps a few dried fruits and nuts it 's good nutrition , and there 's no worry about weight gain also , when i'm camping , i like to take a batch of these tuna cups along in both cases , the cup size just the right for one serving br br i had a minor problem with the latest tuna cups , and it might be just a batch problem my latest tuna was very dry i almost had to choke it down and it seemed rather tasteless i 've had these cups in the past and they seemed much better i have not been satisfied with the present ones however , i like the product and the serving size and it will not deter me from future purchases br br gary peterson . 
i keep a stack of these tuna cups at work , along with lemon juice and teriyaki sauce for variety they are low calorie , satisfying , and nutritious i'm sold on them now buy in bulk and keep on hand all the time ! . 
this is the best one bob 's red mill does n't hold a candle to this it 's fluffy , delicious and does n't stick to the pan br i use 4 1 water to rice yum . 
i like to put wild rice in many dishes this is a good buy and easy to drop into other rice dishes or soups . 
i love portable electric corrals they are a fantastic option for containing horses while camping , etc they are easy to use , give your horse some walking around room , do n't require a level set up area , are flexible for size shape , and are small enough to keep handy in your trailer 's tack room i much prefer using these to portable panels , high lining , tying to the trailer , etc br br there are many portable corral kits on the market , all very similar with the same kinds of components \( except the zareba ezee , which is a different animal \) so i 'll give you a component by component rundown on the items in this kit br br charger this kit comes with a charger that takes 2 d batteries i was leery of this , having had less than stellar performance from a 2d charger in the past but this one works pretty good , producing a reasonable strength zap with 100 feet of electric tape \( with good grounding in damp , solid soil \) if your horse is already accustomed to and respectful of electric fencing , this should be sufficient the charger is easy to use , with the fence and ground terminals clearly marked the on off switch is very accessible , and a light and an audible sound tell you when it 's on br br electric tape this kit is advertised as coming with 200 feet of tape my kit had only 100 feet 100 feet is enough for one horse i do n't know where they 're coming with up the statement `perfect for containing 4 5 horses for short periods of time' no way , not even close , even if i had received the full 200 feet of course , it 's easy enough to pick up more electric tape at the farm store but beware that the more tape you add on , the less zap you 'll get from your charger so i'm not sure if the 2d charger would be strong enough with 200 feet of tape the tape in this kit comes with a handle pre installed it 's a nice handle with a good feel to it , but it does n't connect nicely to the posts i rigged up an extra little tape loop to hook the handle to br br step in posts these are my favorite kind of step in posts each post has numerous clips to slide the tape through , so you can set at the right height it 's very quick and easy to insert and remove the tape from the clips , making set up and take down easier br br corner guy lines this kit comes with some very nice corner guy lines and metal bracing stakes honestly , i 'll probably never use them with this style of fence , there usually is n't much \( if any \) tension on the posts , so i 've needed corner guy lines why add to set up and take down time \? but if you prefer to use the corner guy lines , i think you 'll like the ones in this kit they are nice quality adjustable lines , with metal stakes br br wires , ground rod , etc of course this kit contains the necessary wires to connect the charger to the fence , and the charger to ground the ground rod is a 12 pointed spike nothing special here br br carrying bag oh my gosh , a for this carrying bag ! the bag has one long skinny section for the posts , and a separate snap off zipper tote for the other components within the smaller bag , there are separate compartments and elastic holders for each piece no more jumble of stuff ! ! ! i love it \( one quibble one of the step in posts had pierced the bag during packing or shipping the bag is made of pretty heavy duty fabric , but not quite heavy duty enough to stand up to a pointed spike and the ends of the bag are not reinforced to avoid this problem \) br br all in all , this portable fence kit is about as good as any i 've seen and would be a reasonable choice for anyone wanting a camping corral just do n't expect it to contain 4 5 horses , unless you 're rotating those horses in and out one at a time . 
this product is both effective and convenient we were able to assemble it and have it working within 30 minutes it worked great as a maternity ward for our alpaca millay and her new cria we were able to give them some private time while not feeling as though they were separated from the herd i highly recommend this product and will have many uses for it in the future ! please view our pictures we have provided in the customer photo section ! ! . 
this kit pulls together several standard components rather nicely i am using it for supplemental grazing of horses , particularly to get small areas that are not permanently enclosed as pasture , but that get overgrown and or delicious br br i like it setup time , once you figure out the components , is about 15 minutes it has all the pieces to make a very reasonable temporary electric corral tape , posts , charger , ground , and gate hook br br the 8 step in posts are fairly standard they have nice pointy metal stakes at the bottom that make them relatively easy to insert in moist ground you probably ca n't get them into rock hard dry ground , but that 's not a surprise there are clips to give you flexibility in the fence height but you 've probably seen them at the feed store this kind of post is pretty short and will feel quite short compared to a normal horse fence br br the kit is supposed to come with 200' of 1 2 electric tape mine \( as a vine kit \) only had 100' this is enough for one very well behaved horse in a 25x25 square the tape is not much of a visual barrier , especially with only one strand this is not a fence i 'd trust for a problem horse or for long unattended periods 200' would be enough for either two strands or to have a 50x50 square and would be a much better value of time spent to grazing time 50 x 50 is still quite small and the fence is still not substantial it would be straightforward to add tape , but adding distance also increases the load on the charger br br the product description says 4 5 horses i would not feel safe doing that two quiet horses who know each other well and are already familiar with electric fence , maybe three for very brief periods , if you had the 50 x 50 and were nearby or had a secure outer fence for grazing , three horses would have the area mowed in just a couple of hours br br the charger which uses 2 d batteries has plenty of zap new i was pleased by how easy it was to work with it has its own spike , allowing you to set it up away from the fence the connections are long enough that you can put it out of nose range the grounding nail was easy to set up and pull out br br i like that it comes with a simple corner bracing system you can set it up without the corner braces , depending upon how tight you like your fence and how stiff the ground is but when you need the braces , you 're glad to have the option br br the tape comes on a handy small spinning jenny , which is designed to hang on the fence when it is installed it 's a simple thing , and thoughtfully done it makes it easy to unroll the fence when setting up , and easy to reroll when putting it away there is no problem doing the whole setup and takedown by yourself br br the hook for the gate is n't quite a match for the brackets on the posts a little bigger hook , or some sort of metal bracket , would be nice , to give a sense of a more secure latch still , you 're counting on the fence never being touched , so it 's not a big problem br br the bag for the kit is amazing everything fits inside beautifully , with thoughtful pockets even a special pocket for the instructions it is easy to carry and extremely organized i was very impressed to see the thought and effort put into the bag , which makes the kit much easier to use and deal with than just a pile of fence parts the bag is big enough that there is room for extra items in both the long post compartment and the smaller bag section br br this is a very nice and handy kit to have around if you have quiet horses that respect electric fence . 
i have n't owned a portable fence for horses until now , but i am impressed and liking this product very much upon opening the package i was happy with the portability of the carrying bag , and shocked at how lightweight and compact this system is it 's a great accessory to throw in the trailer when taking the horses out , or just to have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses once set up , it wo n't hold more than two of our horses comfortably i do n't think we 'd ever try and manage to get 4 inside like the product advertises ! br br the instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it i can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well \( such as alpacas \) , but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them the step in posts are fantastically designed , the overall design makes the fence very versatile , setting up easily pretty much anywhere your horse an go br br we 're very happy with it 's design and portability and will get a lot of good use out of this system , i think ! . 
i am always impressed when someone tries to solve an old problem in a new way and i have never been happy hobbling my horse i 'd rather she could escape from a dangerous situation , and something unpredictable is far more likely to happen on the trail than at home sooo here we have this device that is compact and weighs only 15 pounds , thus is easy to pack for trail rides and since it operates on easily obtainable d cells , no problem being off the grid br br the fi shock hc 100 portable paddock showed up in a nice durable red cordura nylon case the long part contains eight molded , reinforced plastic stakes with foot push tabs to make it easy to get the metal spikes at the bottom , into the ground their working height seems to be just about 3 feet multiple slots allow a variety of configurations in set up br br a smaller bag attaches to the pole bag with snaps it contains 100' of conductive tape on a reel \( no , i do n't know why the product description says 200' \) , the transformer of nicely molded , durable looking green plastic , a transformer stand to be tamped into the ground , a shoulder strap , and two d cell batteries which i promptly put in a safer place so they could n't accidentally contact conductive material and discharge br br this proved easy enough to set up in an area that is clear of tall brush that could cause trouble when contacting the live tape properly set up , the paddock 's batteries did not drain of course i carried extras i also chose to guy the corners which i am used to with tents of course i had to bring extra rope and tent stakes for that purpose no problem br br this worked for one not huge horse who is trained to electric fences , so she does n't challenge them sure , any beast of her size could easily break out , but i 'd want her to if in danger no , i ca n't see how the stated 4 or 5 horses could be contained in this enclosure but this a viable solution on the trail , for my mare . 
got this to take along on backpacking trips with the horses it works fine for that purpose , the size is perfect and worked like a charm the two horses did n't attempt a getaway , at least br br easy to put up and easy to take down , along with the portability makes this a camping winner ! . 
i do n't have horses , so i am not using this in the traditional way br br our backyard is being redone and all the fences are down with a pool there , though covered , i was concerned about the wanderers etc so this came in handy and it was so easy to set up . 
this is a great temporary fence for 1 or 2 horses it is kinda unwieldy and you may need a little help setting it up if you are a smallish person but it works great after setup . 
i bought this color for a cake replica of the stanley cup that i made i was using this color for the very first time and i have to say that it was perfect ! i was afraid that the silver would be too dark or matte , but it had a sheen and was exactly what i was hoping for . 
this is the first time i have found a us produced truffle oil that actually contains real truffle a lot of other truffle oils just have truffle aroma \( whatever that is \) and a lot of chemicals that sound less than pleasant you can definitely taste the difference as well . 
these cookies are amazing they taste as good as if not better than the original brands i only wish local stores would catch on and carry this cookie . 
these cookies are ridiculous they are just as delectable as well any popular chocolate sandwich with cream center cookie you can think of \) when you compare them , they are slightly larger in serving size \( 2g bigger \) , and still they have about 10 fewer calories , the same fat , sugar , and carb content , but 25 less saturated fat , three times the fiber , and are much more nutritious \( loads of vitamins , minerals , etc \) plus , you do n't have to eat 3 cookies , you can just have one or two \( good luck \) everyone who has come to my house has asked to try one , and they went crazy for them if you are craving something sweet after a meal and still want to put good things into your body , you will absolutely love these cookies delicious to munch and no weird after taste whatsoever \( unlike the whonu chocolate chip cookies \) just sweet , chocolatey , oreo esque yumminess br br i will say , though , that i cannot , for the life of me , figure out why they 're so expensive on amazon maybe because they 're not in every grocery store yet , so , when combined with shipping , amazon can get away with charging a little more \? who knows i know i bought them here for convenience , and i'm so glad i got three boxes i know you can find them in shoprite or walmart for around 3 br br wherever you end up getting them , enjoy ! . 
these chocolate sandwich creme cookies by whonu \? are every bit as delicious as similar brands but they are healthier for you true , they have almost the same sugar , fat and carb amounts of the best known name brand of these cookies but as others have noted they also give you fiber with noticeably more vitamins and minerals than that other brand this is a plus ! br br they 're really good as a snack and it 's hard to stop at the serving size of just three cookies but i guess i'm allowed an occasional guilty pleasure ! as i write this they are a bit too expensive on this website try looking for these cookies elsewhere unless you want the convenience of having them shipped to your door br br overall , these awesome chocolate sandwich creme cookies by whonu \? are the best ! i definitely recommend them as an excellent , healthier alternative to the major name brand of this type of cookie br br i love `em ! enjoy ! . 
i bought these locally , not from amazon i'm in arizona and they are sold in albertsons and bashas stores they are absolutely delicious and taste just like other cookies i bought all four of the flavors to test them out the only one i did n't like was the chewy chocolate chip all others though are wonderful i count calories and try to eat healthy , but i do indulge with treats sometimes this is the perfect treat since it has all the vitamins and fiber ! i will never eat a regular cookie again what 's the point when you can actually get nutrition from tasty cookies ! \? . 
this review is based on taste only , not nutritional value or any of the other qualities or selling points of these cookies i wrote three sort of similar reviews for this brand of cookies this review is for those who are looking for a cookie because they want a cookie , not vitamins or fiber or whatever i bought them because i have a sweet tooth and wanted some cookies and these were on sale plus i had a coupon i purchased the crispy cookies , the vanilla sandwich cookies and the chocolate sandwich cookies i thought they were all very good and would not hesitate to buy them again i found these cookies to taste very good , very similar to an oreo except that the cookie part was a little thinner and crispier than an oreo oreos might taste a wee bit better but then they 're oreos , come on a cool fact i found out when i was looking up ingredients for whonu chocolate sandwich cookies and oreos , the first ingredient in regular oreos is sugar and in these cookies and most other sandwich cookies i think it is flour i found that interesting for some reason anyway , out of the three flavors i tried this was my least favorite but only because i like vanilla alot , these are still great tasting chocolate sandwich cookies ! . 
these are grossly overpriced it is a package of three boxes but when you take into account that they are a dollar of two per box than they should be , you then have to pay for shipping sorry , i would skip them my local grocery store carries them and a box is anywhere from 2 98 to 3 49 each although these are healthier than some other cookies , you still have to watch the fat , sugar and salt contents whole foods are much better for you but in a moment or two of indulging , these fit the bill just the price on this site is ridiculous ! ask your grocer to start carrying them . 
i purchased cafe excellence crazy caramel , flavored whole bean br coffee it has a very good flavor and would buy again and the price was great . 
great , fresh coffee beans gave as a christmas gift we all had some of it and loved it the smell was great and the flavour was awsome . 
this gum is my absolute favorite by purchasing on amazon i can get the savings of large quanities at a very good price i highly recommend to all gum chewers plus as you enjoy the peppermint flavor and freshing of breath you are whitening your teeth all at the same time . 
took me years to find the ultimate chewing gum , but when i found wrigley 's orbit white peppermint the search ended i 've been chewing this gum for many years now , i occasionally try something else , but nothing ever wins the peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath , and toward the end of its chewable life , it does n't start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do it simply loses its flavor br br only drawbacks i usually chew 2 pieces at a time , so they are a bit small and 2 they just changed the packaging it used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket , inside suit jacket pocket etc , now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it 's bulky not sure why they had to change probably to do with retail stores layout this wo n't prevent me from buying it , but it 's really annoying wrigley just never change the flavor ! . 
i bought these for my girlfriend who just happens to live in california , and she loved them the chocolates came fresh and the packaging was just beautiful br br hand written card , her name was hand written on the front of the card , and extra care was taken in the whole process i will definitely buy again from choclatique br br if i could rate higher , i would i was sent a 15 refund for the shipping because my girlfriend lived nearby i 've never had such an honest company before , that was pretty cool ! . 
got these luscious wine chocolates to use as part of my stocking stuffers they were yummy and a big hit with everyone would definitely buy again . 
i was starting to think that snyder and i just did n't share the same idea about what 's good in snack flavors i have tried several of their other pretzel pieces flavors \( buffalo wing and honey mustard \) and was very disappointed i have to say , that these cheddar cheese flavor pieces are not just good , but spectacularly good ! they have a very rich , buttery cheese flavor with pleasant yeasty aftertaste these are totally addictive it 's very easy to munch through the entire large bag in one setting . 
very tasty cheese flavor because of crunch and small pieces \( of mixed size \) , it goes a long way without adding too many calories a good buy walt b , apple valley . 
my husband is a pretzel lover and has become addicted to these i do n't see the draw , being firmly in the potato chip camp myself , but to each his own our local stores only stock these occasionally , so he has tried all the other flavors , and while he does like the jalapeno , they do n't like him back it 's nice to be able to buy them here and not have to run all over town looking for them . 
my daughter loves these snacks and ca n't get them in china where she is working now so i ordered them for her very satisfied and she was very appreciative . 
when we get very busy in our home , i like this sausage a lot for quick meal options the flavor is a bit sweet , and works well with lots of types of vegetables usually i 'll slice it lengthwise and saute it until done , then add sweet potatoes , potatoes and onions to the pan to make up a skillet with a bit of cheese on top it 's all the food groups in a one pan meal that my family enjoys mac and cheese with peas and sausage mixed in is another option that my daughter is crazy for for that i cut the sausage into coins and cook it up , then make up the homemade mac and cheese as usual , add frozen peas and the sausage and finish cooking the sweetness of the sausage with the salty of the cheese is good and it 's just so easy to make . 
i use these to keep my finicky toddler 's protein levels up what 's great , is that they 're delicious just about any way you can imagine cooking a sausage ! br br a favorite recipe sautee one large onion , about a tablespoon each dried basil and oregano , and some salt and pepper in about 2t of butter add sausage , that 's been cut into coins , and russet potatoes cut into 1 4 thick rounds cover all with chicken stock and simmer until potatoes are soft but not dissolved throw in a few handfuls of pre washed baby spinach \( i usually use about a half a pound , and frozen would work fine , just put it in a minute earlier \) stir until the spinach is cooked , and then serve ! enjoy ! . 
having recently purchased a single cup coffee maker , we discovered green mountain and their delicious varieties of coffee i love the island coconut flavor so much it is now a staple in our household with all other flavors taking a 2nd seat the roast of the coffee is wonderful and really lets the coconut shine through try it with a little chocolate coffee mate creamer and you 'll swear you were having a decadent treat straight from the islands yum ! ! ! . 
the best smooth tasting new coffee we have had since we have been to the islands , all good as ice coffee . 
if you 're looking for a very light , refreshing coffee , this one is for you nice coconut flavor without any bitterness may be too light for some people . 
i became addicted to eating these the first time i tasted them which was years ago once you eat one , you just ca n't stop until they 're gone they are n't too sweet and make the perfect snack i love these things ! ! ! . 
my synagogue 's passover care package had some of these candies in it , and wow are they good ! americans have little exposure to sesame seeds except atop a burger bun time to taste these nutty little wonders ! individually wrapped to keep them fresh and slow you down \( grins \) better than peanut brittle any day ! and these are kosher for passover ! . 
this is amongst the best karachi halwa i have eaten not rubbery or super chewy like a lot of the other ones just perfect individually wrapped pieces in the box . 
i'm allergic to wheat so i have few options for pasta corn pasta has a grainy texture that i do n't care for , quinoa pasta is the same and rice pasta has a tendency to stick together this orgran pasta is perfect i think i even overcooked it a bit and it still held it 's shape \( s \) \( farm animals ! \) and it was delicious my husband also agreed that it was really good the calorie count seems a little lower than other pastas as well i will continue to order this product as long as amazon carries it ! it 's grrrrrrrreat ! . 
my celiac daughter loves the gluten free animal pasta it is by far her favorite we make macaroni and cheese with it and she asks for it several times a week and takes the leftovers to school for lunch the next day she loves that the pasta is animal shapes and different colors and the horse is her favorite a must have . 
i ordered this pasta because i thought my children would love the animal shapes since i am the only glutenfree in our home , i try to find fun things for the entire family instead of making 2 separate meals when i served this at dinner the other night , my husband 's expression said it all ! he followed his surprised look with now this is pasta ! we could not believe how good this pasta was we are now hooked ! i can not wait to try some more of the orgran products . 
i have to eat gluten free , but my family does n't this is the only pasta so far that my kids ca n't see a real difference they like it a lot this is one i fix when i do n't have time or energy to fix separate things for them and myself because it tastes yummy for all of us . 
i have a sweet tooth and so does my three year old son this is a great after dinner dessert that i feel good about giving him and myself they are healthy and you can taste the flax seed in them , but i have really grown to love that healthy taste and texture i even come to crave it now they are satisfying and filling and my whole family loves them i buy them in bulk and love other hodgson mill products as well br br if you eat nothing but white flour products and ca n't get used to or absolutly hate whole grains and their taste and texture , then this is not the product for you if you are the family that tries to make healthy choices and have healthier alternitives then this is a wonderful product i still love to have my junk food \( pillsbury and hershey 's here i come ! ! ! \) i just try to have it only on very special occasions the rest of the time i choose to nurish my body and satisfy my taste buds that is when i reach for this brownie mix br br my only complaint is that they do n't taste too great after only a couple days so make up a batch , eat em' up quick \( within 2 days \) and you will be smiling ! . 
good , but i add a cup of whole wheat flour and a tsp of baking powder along with a couple of tbsp of cocoa powder because i like brownies a little higher and more cake like they come yummy and with the added flour , they 're not too sweet . 
my kids love brownies , but i could no longer by the regular brands in the grocery store with a good conscious i still wanted the convenience of a mix , though these fit the bill they first time i made them , they thought they tasted funny because they were so used to the processed crap now they eat them up and have gotten used to the flax taste i think they are yummy ! br these are in no way low calorie or low fat though instructions call for a lot of oil , eggs , and butter \( you can use earth balance and egg replacer if you 're vegan \) flax seeds also have a good amount of fat \( although the healthy kind \) i 've made them with olive oil before and they were just as good i 've also added extra organic cocoa powder to make them extra chocolatey , but they really do n't need it i love the chewy texture of the flax seeds there are very few ingredients , i could probably make the same brownies homemade , but it would be a pain to have to grind the flax seeds , etc these are easy and yummy even though they are not necessarily healthy from a calorie and fat standpoint , i can feel good about giving my kids treats that are n't loaded with processed crap . 
add walnuts to this healthful brownie and perhaps a light iceing do not overback or it will be very dry lots of good stuff in this brownie , but the flax taste is a little strong i really feel no guilt when having a brownie snack for me or my kids . 
i really like this brownie mix unfortunately my local grocer has stopped carrying them hence buying them from amazon ! ! they are easy to prepare and bake up very nicely very moist and i think it has just the right amount of chocolate flavor yes , they are healthy and are more dense than traditional brownies but they fill my chocolate craving better and i really feel like i have eaten dessert not just some fluff from a box . 
i made these according to package directions , and added 1 cup of mini chocolate chips , and they were awesome ! they took longer to cook than the box says , maybe that 's because of the chocolate chips either way , they were great and i 'll definitely make them again . 
for quite a while , before amazon starting retailing food items , it was nearly impossible to locate this healthy underground favorite brownie mix there were blogs and food sites bemoaning how hard it was to locate so when we saw it on amazon we ordered a case and baked up batches for all our friends and family the concensus was it tastes healthier but , never the less , quite good it is far better when prepared with at least a cup of mini chocolate chips \( not regular chips which can sink to the bottom \) we buy good quality belgian chocolate minichips this mix is a great alternative if you want less guilt in your guilty pleasures . 
of course they do n't taste quite as good as regular brownies but hello \? that 's because they 're healthy ! and that being said , they are fantastic ! why eat crap when there are such good alternatives ! \? . 
if your not into healthy and into flax seed do not buy these they are healthy and they taste like it ! i love them they are very good my husband loved them too it 's all a matter of taste if you 're looking for a dunkan hines brownie these are not it . 
we like this brownie mix and i usually use the low fat recipe on it i also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit dry br br we still buy this by the case . 
these brownies are good , but the flax seed texture can be a real turn off to minimize it , i added a little whole wheat flour , splenda and cocoa big improvement and my guests never complained \( like they did the first time i made the brownies ! \) . 
you can taste the flaxseed in these whole wheat muffins and it 's a great taste good chocolate flavor and texture i add chopped walnuts . 
if you are used to eating flaxseed , then this is the brownie for you hodgson mill brownies are super easy to make , and taste great since i like dark chocolate , i usually add a little more cocoa . 
i received all the ingredients in a timely manner all the ingredients were nicely packed and remained fresh through the shipping stages it was more than i needed for the meal i was making , so i had plenty of left over ingredients . 
the produce was extremely fresh i made a delicious thai soup with the items and had plenty to spare . 
exceptionally fresh quality and quantity and shipped much faster than expected i was able to make great tom yum soup thank you ! a href http www amazon com gp product b000p151ai fresh thai produce kit a . 
i first tried this tea at at french restaurant that had ran out of the usual black tea with mint to my surprise this tea beats any tea \( without milk \) no sugar needed it is naturally sweetened ! . 
love this hot chocolate nice creamy flavor the price is good and i love the single packs this is not a flavor available to me locally . 
i love the chamomile tea its sweet and mild its excellent for a bed time tea . 
with all herbal treatments it is important to understand that the earlier in ilness one will start using them the better br i love to use herbal teas and find them very effective when used properly . 
i do n't know which herb is so tasty in here but it 's a great combination i do n't like licorice flavors , and this tea is great because i can reap the great benefits of licorice root , without tasting it ! br br it really does help my symptoms , and drinking it for prevention has worked great for me as well and you cannot beat the shipping price \( free with super saver shipping \) with amazon . 
i always start my son on this tea when he starts a cold he actually now asks for it i prepare it and put it in a thermo for him to drink during the day at school it works wonders when he starts drinking it right away when the symptoms are obvious the throat does heal from this tea if he starts it after the illness has taken full course , it still helps it sooth it a lot my son loves it and i have recommended to other friends who now buy it all the time great effective results ! ! ! . 
we just got our first order a few days ago , and my 10 month old daughter loves them ! they 're just like the gerber mini veggies , but much cheaper although they still cost a good bit , having a nutrient filled , easy to take anywhere travel snack is well worth it my daughter does n't have any teeth yet , and she has n't had any problems eating them they 're light and fluffy , yet full of flavor . 
i do n't know why my toddler is so crazy about these , but he is he was snacking on so many cheerios every day that i was desperate to find something else that he would like but would n't require refrigeration , and this saved the day i feel good about feeding him healthier snacks and he is positively in love with these ! . 
my dog has heart failure and ca n't have the standard dog treats because of the salt these are perfect she likes to hunt for her snacks , and these are perfect to toss out to her , and let her go nuts she really likes them \) . 
these are a delicious guilt free snack that i always have handy they are so convenient and last a long time i also get the corn and mixed veggies which are also wonderful you can get them at whole foods but not at this price . 
we first tried this because our toddler went through a picky eater phase she loved these ! they are crunchy and small enough for her to pick up i love them because they are organic and a veggie that she actually asks for i mainly give them to her right out the package but i 've also mixed them into scrambled eggs , which she really likes too . 
these taste great and have a great texture br br our 2 year old has little interest in eating fresh vegetables , but she loves these she actually prefers these over goldfish crackers or other products of dubious nutritional value ! to me , that fact is worth the expense it is worth the cost to get her to eat vegetables . 
we love this brand of freeze dried fruit and veggies they make it easy to have healthy on the go snacks for our 2 year old ! . 
my 22 month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food they are tasty , healthy , and have zero additives on the downside , every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking rock i can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth , so i worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth that being said , it 's been months and nothing bad has happened and it has n't worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas , it 's just something that i feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product . 
feel like a protein boost \? got the nibbles \? do n't want to succumb to potato chips \? here 's a great alternative ! just do n't let your toddler try to open the package or your peas will be all over the floor making for an expensive snack for the dog and a grumpy mommy . 
i bought this for christmas and gave a few away as gifts you get a bunch of boxes , but if you love bacon , there are a lot of uses for it ! i 've made sour cream chip dip , cheese balls , added to mashed potatoes and mac cheese , sprinkled on baked potatoes in place of bacon bits if you can dream it you can do it br br the bacon flavor is not over powering , it is a subtle delicious taste i love davis davis products and will be trying different varieties for sure . 
dogs love this product but it ends up too crumbly and hard to give to the dogs but it is really a great product . 
for serious goat cheese lovers , this is a step up from the french goat cheese that you can buy at the grocery store i had never had smoked goat cheese before and this was a revelation the creamy , smooth , a little sour taste went fabulously well with the smoke flavor i used it sprinkled over a tomato , bean and romaine salad and also spread on toast points topped with an apple zucchini relish from the 101 cookbooks blog outstanding artisan cheese that i look forward to enjoying again . 
if you like goat cheese and smoked cheeses you will love this it has a very smokey creamy flavor try it spread on crackers with a little black truffle oil . 
i have a history of mild moderate acid reflux , so i take it easy with coffee i was delighted to discover puroast , which is a reduced acid coffee that is reasonably priced the french roast flavor is utterly delicious it tastes like i went to a coffee house for fancy coffee , but it 's just brewed in my drip coffee pot in my kitchen \( even more convenient if my husband does it for me ! \) try it you wo n't be disappointed the cinnamon flavor is also very , very good . 
i have n't been able to drink coffee for over 5 years due to gastritis and indigestion with even a few drops of the stuff coffee is my favorite and reaching desperation i gave puroast a try this stuff is a miracle not only am i symptom free , it is good coffee i am so thankful to be able to have coffee back in my life ! . 
i was delighted to discover this rich tasting coffee , which has half the acid of regular brands i served it to a guest with an acid reflux problem and she not only enjoyed the cuppa , she reported that she felt fine afterwards this is a great coffee to have in your pantry for finick y guests or to stock for discerning coffee drinkers who find the taste of starbucks and dunkin' donuts simply too harsh also loved the charming packaging . 
this coffee is a great alternative for someone who has acid reflux and ulcer problems the low acid allows me to still have my caffine for the day maybe not as smooth tasting as my usual blend , but i'm so thankful for it really close in taste . 
i 've been using this low acid coffee for a few weeks now and along with the taste , i enjoy not having an acid stomach , especially the morning after to me , there is no difference in taste between it and regular coffee br br i give it 5 stars . 
i decided to try puroast over a year ago because of stomach problems and mouth swelling puroast did the trick ! plus it tastes great ! could n't be happier with it \( although i wish they would bring the organic decaf back ! \) . 
my wife and i tried this product a few days ago we were not disappointed the coffee had a good flavor , and the low acid was a nice added benefit . 
i did n't have high expectations that i would like this but i love coffee and have trouble with nausea from the acid i am a starbucks fan and while this was not as full bodied as that it was surprisingly good nice to not have the acid issues that come with coffee , this did not bother me at all or make me nauseous i still prefer the taste of starbucks houseblend but now i'm not sure the extra body is worth the acid this is a good alternative that i found i liked better and better as i got use to it give it a try ! . 
this is a great company and the first i have ever seen to offer a low acid option you can absolutely taste the difference it 's coffee without the bitterness makes it possible to enjoy the purity of the bean without the bitter taste they also have very cool black mugs love them ! . 
i use this in my breadmaker but make it with warm milk and an additional egg , which greatly improves the texture when made with just water and a small amount of butter , the crust comes out very , very chewy in my breadmachine i have also made this bread and used carrot juice in place of the water , which makes it a beautiful color and naturally sweet . 
i have tried many bread machine mixes and most have been okay but this one rates an excellent because not only is it a very good basic loaf , it also works very well with additives , either prepared entirely in the bread machine , or \( after the second rise \) removed from the machine , shaped and baked on a stone in the oven br stretched and flattened with a filling of either savory or sweet ingredients , then rolled and set to rise and then bake in a loaf pan , it produced excellent herb and onion bread , cinnamon raisin bread and a brown butter and seed bread br i buy it via the subscribe and save plan as i use it often . 
i love fresh bread and hodgson brand is awesome i usually just use the dough cycle on my bread machine and then form the dough in buns and stickss so i can easily take them on to go even if the brand is not organic all the ingredients are natural and processed without chemicals but most of all they taste great all it requires is some water and shortening \( butter , or oil \) i have even been able to use applesauce instead of oil but it didnt get as rich taste i have ordered all varieties they had on amazon , whole wheat honey is specially tasty no more supermarket bread ! . 
i must admit when i first ordered this bread for my new panasonic bread maker , i was not expecting anything other than potato bread such as i buy at a nearby store however , was i ever surprised ! it was absolutely the best stuff and with some organic butter piled high and properly melted it was on a par with ambrosia i just could not believe how good it was and is since the first loaf , i have made other breads which have been generally excellent but none are quite at the level of this potato bread it is really good ! perhaps the credit goes to my new bread machine ! highly recommended ! ! ! general info the package makes a 1 5 pound loaf on my machine the recommended setting is basic and the loaf bakes in 4 hours also , the flour is non gmo verified as labelled . 
since i started making hodgson wholesome potato bread , my husband will not eat store bought bread anymore ! we make about two loaves a week , in different varieties of the hodgson mill brand the honey whole wheat and white bread mixes are also great br i like using my old bread machine to make the dough , then shape into loaf and bake in the oven makes perfect loaf every time , also makes delicious rolls br glad i discovered this brand of bread mixes on amazon they are wholesome , and i know what i'm putting into the bread i bake now great product ! . 
i used extra yeast and a little more water and it came out very light with a heard crust , which i like i will order it again not much of a potato taste but good bread . 
i recently purchased a bread machine and i tried this potato bread mix i have made it three times now and it has come out amazing each and every time the other great thing about this particular mix is that i have experimented with altering the amount of butter \( in the last batch i actually doubled the butter amount but then added less water \) and it came out buttery and yuuuummmmmmyyyy ! ! br br i encourage everyone who has a bread machine to try this particular mix . 
i am so totally satisfied by hodgson mill products i probably have purchased 100 loaves at this point i used some as a present to my brother with good results , too br br never have i seen old smelling mix nor have i ever had a yeast failure their taste texture is wonderful never have i had a slicing failure where you ca n't get a slice to hold together long enough to lay it down the different types lend themselves well to adding ingredients such as chopped nuts or sesame seeds or millet seed or use your own imagination coming in nice units of 6 loaves makes pantry storage easy , and once opened , the carton yields 6 boxes with best by dates easily accessible on each so rotating your shelf stock is almost goof proofed br br next time you walk a grocery store , note the prices there ! here again , i think you really ca n't beat the quality with a really fair price that hodgson provides it seems to me that they have expended great effort to have the best product they can produce the best shipping available for their customers br br buy with great confidence based on my experiences with them during the last 2 3 years i hope this helps decision making . 
updated 12 02 2010 finally have found a perfect 'match' in taste to my irish grandmother 's potato bread loaf pictured w dill added very tasty br br a href http www amazon com gp product b000fdkqcy hodgson mill wholesome potato bread mix , 16 ounce boxes \( pack of 6 \) a br br since now in the 20 's and low teens wind chill these 18 boxes will be used often br br the picture shows this loaf made in older breadmaker crust set dark for croutons and stuffing , as well as fine bread crumbs for mac 'n cheese buttered toppings br br br have been using hodgson 's mill products for years ordered 3 sets of 6 boxed for breadmaker but intend to 'kick up' the taste w crushed in oil garlic dill cinnamon raisins whole cranberries and whatever else takes our fancy for dinner meals or great homemade soup 'dunkin' one can make any type roll or breadstick they choose also going to try as 'flat breads' br br honey wheat on the way 2 sets delivered an hour ago potato and caraway rye br now to make a choice which will come first . 
i love this bread i do n't even like the smell of commercial bread you can smell the chemicals from miles i added rosemary , garlic and olive oil to the mix and serve it just out of the machine it was a hit with my dinner guests . 
this was great so soft , so tasty better than expected perfect loaf every time . 
i have tried a few of this brand of bread mix in my bread machine and while all have been good i must say to my family and i that this is the best ! i have made potato bread from scratch in my bread machine and this is right up there with that nice flavor , great texture , well worth the price ! i have bought this a few times on amazon and will continue to do so ! . 
i am extremely satisfied with both hodgson mill bread mixes that i purchased online the potato bread mix actually rose and stuck to the top of my bread making machine and became entangled in the mixing blade , so it was difficult to remove otherwise , the bread tasted great ! ! the rye bread was also delicious it didn'nt rise as much , and i had no trouble removing it from the bread machine the rye loaf was much denser than the potato bread loaf br br the only drawback to purchasing these products online was the shipping costs i have since found out that i can purchase the same brand products at heb and kroger grocery stores , and will not order online , again . 
i just got my bread machine for christmas , so being a novice i thought i would try to keep it simple \) the hodgson mill products are wonderful everything is included even the yeast the bread came out delicious , it was easy to slice it is like eating a country white bread not soft n mushy like traditional white bread my family enjoyed this it makes great toast as well if you try this i think you will be happy with it . 
this is a fantastic bread mix i do not use the bread machine , i make it in a bowl , hand made , and have had no problems at all i do not know why people are having any problems with this it is terrific amazon , please keep this in stock please . 
i like this bread , and several other flavors in this brand this one and the seven grain are my favorites they bake consistently well in my wolfgang puck machine recommended ! . 
this product is as good as any that i have ever used and is so convenient through amazon as it has become hard to find in the stores . 
i love these bread mixes there is nothing like making your own bread i admit i use a bread maker not clever enough to use my hands but i still enjoy the experience i have tried 2 different hodgson mixes and they are both excellent . 
the potato bread was easy to mix , rises well in my breadmaker , cooks as it should and best of all was very tasty the bread has a near white bread texture , and was very good i purchased all of the hodgson mixes and this was one of my favorites . 
i recently tried this line of breads on vacation and loved the one we tried i could n't find the european cheese herb flavor that we had locally so i went to order from amazon com as happens from time to time the seller was out of that flavor so i picked up the potato bread instead and it was also very good i still need to get the cheese herb because that one was awesome . 
this is delicious bread and i can quickly make up loaves of bread to eat or give away for a special gift . 
my family and i all agree that hodgson mill potato bread is one of the best mixes on the market a loaf of this bread lasts about two hours before it is gone it has become a favorite of ours , and we will be making lots do n't run out of this one ! . 
to the gentleman who reviewed this and said just go to the store and get better , well , i'm disabled and the disability van only allows us two packages to carry can you see me carrying two big cases of water home \? i think not br br this is wonderful water sure , you could get it on sale at a better price , and if you can drive or have someone to drive you and carry it in , please do so , but for me it is a sweet deal i ordered six cases and watched the ups guy set them inside the door for me i have nothing to complain about if the price is right for you , with all considered , you wo n't go wrong here . 
this water is delicious i'm not picky , but i can taste bad water with chemicals or metal taste and this has none of that and at 50 cents per bottle , delivered to your door , it 's a great price i have a teenage son and he drinks these all the time and it 's a okay with me better than drinking a coke . 
i continue to buy this water \( as well as the larger size bottle \) for a number of reasons br 1 \) the taste of the water is just plain good , refreshing , crisp and clean it 's not easy describing water that does n't actually offend ! br 2 \) our filtered municipal water still sucks and this is an excellent alternative for someone with health issues br 3 \) the ups guy does all the heavy work for me all i have to do is put it away br 4 \) i never have to run out of bottled water by availing of the discounted subscribe and save program br if i had any complaint at all it would be that the plastic bottle itself is quite heavy and can be a real pain in your backpack br bottom line for me , the taste and convenience are worth the price and i 'll continue to buy it as long as my budget allows updated note i 've been drinking this water for four months now and had an interesting experience that bears sharing my local kroger had ozarka spring water on sale so i picked up a case wow was that ever a mistake even though the ozarka bottles are very light weight , the taste of the water is so different from talkingrain spring water in that there is a distinct plasticy flavor i 've alway enjoyed the ozarka in the past but had no idea i was settling for drinking plastic water my goodness how my taste buds and senses have changed since drinking the pure goodness on talkingrain spring water i am totally convinced it is worth the extra cost now . 
i am a chemist , so i know about water , and why it can taste like heaven \( e g it is tasteless \) , and why it can taste like sweat \( e g mineral enhanced \) this water is expensive cheap for online , but costly if you are a walmart or target shopper however , i highly recommend you try this , if you want tasteless water you see , when water is mineral enhanced , and its swirling around through the various protrusions and undulations the road provides in the summer heat , the water tends to build a certain taste , which some like , and others do n't i like my water tasteless therefore i recommend this product to those whom do not want h2o minerals , but just plain water . 
this was my first purchase of this water it tastes great and the bottles are thicker than most also , everyone likes that name haha . 
water tastes good i typically prefer only purified water \( did a study on this in grad school back in the day \) but for use at the office , this fills the bill i think it tastes good and looks presentable br br bottles are \( of course \) recyclable , so i do n't feel guilty saying i like the quality of the bottle as well i once had someone pickup water , and they got a chain grocer brand at a steal but the bottle was so flimsy i do n't like that one bit this is the best of both worlds br br shipment arrived fully intact for me . 
always glad to see this water delivered to our doorstep not a drop of it spilled during delivery yet , due to nice quality of bottles br even though the delivery box itself has arrived bashed in , with the tape flopping , must say the shrink wrapping has held , and the bottles themselves have n't spilled a drop of the water br we 're on our third case of it right now , and very happy with this purchase the water tastes good and the bottles hold their shape br br about weight of these bottles commented upon in another review i thought the comment was interesting and it reminded me that yes , i do drive a few bottles to work in the car , i do n't backpack them not a really obvious difference in weight , though , i think maybe necessary for shipping \? br br guess it 's like choosing sleeping bags if you are using a vehicle , you can use a heavier sleeping bag , so they tell me br anyway , i think you 'll like this water , and you get 30 bottles per case , instead of the usual 24 br we plan to order more we 're glad we can do this . 
this water is really good ! ! ! ! ! it is reasonably priced ! ! ! it is mountain spring water ! ! ! please order at least once , you will not regret it it is priced right you get 30qt 16 9 ounce bottles for a great price use your standard shipping 5 to 8 days \( i think \) free shipping that way , you can buy more product be aware , that this is very popular product and sometimes , amazon is out of stock so , you may have to wait 2 or 3 weeks but , it is worth the wait it is a great product ! ! ! ! . 
i thot i was satisfied with the spring water i have bought elsewhere until i bought this brand ! best i have ever tasted no chemical aftertaste i have 2 cases a month delivered since i also use it for all cooking needs and ice cubes too it is soooooo delicious when making a glass of lemonade from fresh lemons with the aforementioned cubes with agave sweetener mercy ! as others have stated , the ups man does all the hard work and i do n't have to worry about running out of the most important staple in my household . 
i bought this water for my 2 pet chinchillas , tank and tony they love this water i have never seen them drink so much in their lives ! i bought this water because chinchillas cannot drink tap water , and spring water is the best for them br i am mad though , because i purchased this item 1 week ago and now it 's 5 cheaper wtf \? br overall , i love this item great water br i tasted it for myself , and it does taste great ! . 
love this water feels silky smooth and clean when you drink it really love the bottles nice and sturdy no squishy plastic and since i had hard time buying and carrying from the grocery store , love the automatic delivery to my back door ! a little more money than store brands , but well worth it . 
i enjoyed this water it was very refreshing i find i have some stomach sensitivity with some bottled waters i did not have that problem with this water nice bottles water comes from washington . 
though this coffee was expensive compared to regular store bought , i am a huge fan coffee usually tears up my stomach so i 've been a tea drinker for years , but this coffee has a low acidic level so i can handle it the aroma is enticing and the bag lasted a long time i am a fan of beans versus grounds so that was another plus it was prompt and the packaging ensured my coffee stayed fresh and intact . 
i tried this milk chocolate with hazelnuts for the first time recently after reading a review that this brand was the best chocolate in the world i had to try it and it was worth every penny i am a dark chocolate fan normally \( 70 is my favorite \) but i have to say i would order this again and give it as a gift it melted like butter in my mouth and was beyond delightful . 
i bought this juice because i really like mangoes it is great refreshing and smooth beverage that everybody in our family enjoy will buy again . 
these are great spices to use on all food types giving a great flavor the bottle sizes are twice the size of that found in a supermarket and about the same price so you get more of what you would normally pay for . 
these are , without question , the best diet crackers i 've ever had i 've had them with and without salt and since i usually put peanut butter on them , i did n't need the salt br br these are great for travel , for kids , and when you just need a very low calorie cracker . 
i am not sure why the 2 speciality stores in my area stopped carrying these as they were usually sold out the cakes are 18 calories , crunchy and good not like the cardboard taste of thicker rice cakes excellent as a base for pb j , or to make an open face sandwich , or to use in pieces like a chip for dips , etc good price on the 12 pack with a 10 month expiration use date . 
these stay together better than round ones , which crumble terribly they are good alone , or with my favorite artisana raw sesame butter they are very well packaged which keeps them from getting broken also , each package i have opened has been fresh thanks for a great product amazon ! . 
i love this product ! so much better than the regular thick rice cakes they are thin , but very compact , so i use them as a great sandwich bread alternative they do n't break apart quick as easily as the regular rice cakes i 've searched the grocery and health food stores in my area and ca n't find this product anywhere i love that they are now available for subscription through amazon com . 
these brown rice cakes are by far the best , i have tried many i can not have very many foods these are my only snack food that i can have they are so good i dont feel like i am missing anything . 
i waited long and with bated breath for amazon to restock the bulk packaging for this product , as european style rice cakes are a pretty specific niche , and they can be a bit difficult to find at local stores \( not to mention expensive \) these are a very different beast from the american style rice cakes that most people associate with the name as other reviews suggest , these are n't quite so air filled or crumbly , having more the density and thickness of a cracker or crisp flatbread but unlike those , these are gluten free , oil free , unsalted , and contain only one ingredient 100 puffed brown rice they 've got a nice light crunch that makes them good for snacking , but they 're a lot healthier than chips or crackers , and the brown rice is definitely preferable to a more processed white rice cake if you 're mindful of blood sugar impact they 're also great for the occasional mild tummy upset , since they 're light and bland and do n't require the preparation of other bland foods br br try them with hummus ! my personal favorite peanut butter , jam , and a sprinkling of chia seeds yum ! . 
i am so happy that amazon got these back in so i could order my second case i do n't eat wheat , it packs the pounds on me around my middle most breads have wheat or if they are gluten free , they cost way too much br br i have eaten all kinds of rice cakes i have found that most will break apart if you 're spreading a nut butter on them not these ! also there are generally 13 rice cakes in a pkg of round regular rice cakes this package of rice cakes has 27 pieces in each bag also , it 's much like consuming a slice of bread without the crusts and they are nice and thin so you do n't eat too much of a good thing br br try these if you 're dissatisfied with regular rice cakes or if you must have gluten free bread ! ! i do n't believe you will be sorry and amazon 's price is so good and free shipping though the box is sort of big , it 's pretty light and stores easily away i live alone and i'm on my next to last pkg from my first case and they are not at all stale i stored them in my cool dark garage in their original cardboard box br br also they are made in belgium if that helps anyone the packaging is air tight and they come 12 pkgs in a box and are in the perfect sized box , and mine arrived without a sign of any damage and i have yet to find even a single cracked rice cake ! they are rather neutral in their taste i make a special butter spread that i like on them real well you take equal parts of room temperature butter , olive oil and water and blend ingredients until smooth you can refrigerate this , it sets up but does n't get hard so it is always spreadable and tastes really good ! i use organic butter , olive oil and filtered water , but you do n't have this spread is so good and i believe it 's better for you than straight butter br br also , i only use one cake to make a single sided sandwich , as with any rice cake using two as you would two pieces of bread just does n't seem to work as well but a single sided sandwhich with these rice cakes is very enjoyable ! br br hope this helps you decide to try them everyone i 've given some to , have had only good comments about them . 
surprisingly tasty thin and crip very cracker like and good for snacking i got these for my husband who is on a very low sodium diet these are great for when we travel it is n't easy finding prepackaged low sodium foods that taste good , but these work quite well . 
crisp crunchy and thin very low in sodium i usually prefer mine plain but shared a package with a friend who enjoyed these with a tuna salad topping a great alternative to the expensive styrofoam varieties sold at most stores excellent product the rice cakes for this brand are also wonderful and for those on a no salt diet , 0 sodium . 
these crackers are great the beauty is not in their own flavor , but the fact that they are a perfect , crispy , low calorie , gluten free delivery mechanism for all manner of spreads and slices they do n't come with over powering artificial flavorings to compete with a topping of your choice some of my favorites are peanut butter and banana or laughing cow cheese with turkey pepperoni . 
i live on salt and as a result have hypertension these products work surprisingly fast to lower your high blood pressure and to put it as nice as possible , keep you alive longer and , that is a scientific fact , as salt is only a habit and has no real useful pupose except to cause many unhealthy habits and conditions keep caring about us and do n't stop producing foods that are very healthy . 
these are not only a good value \( health food stores really jack up the prices on rice cakes ! \) but also are nicely thin and easy to use to spread stuff on . 
i was able to do so much with these crackers ! they 're easy to spread on and stack and put toppings on ! i definitely enjoyed them and so did all my friends d . 
susie 's thin cakes are a great snack if you are trying to lose weight or just eat healthy i bought the one that is sodium , cholesterol , fat and sugar free for three cakes it is only 54 calories , so you can add a toppin like taboule or your favorite topping without the guilt they are very tasty the only problem is the availability of the product i am on a waiting list with amazon for this product . 
i purchased these based on others recommendations the rice cakes are delicious thinner than the usual rice cakes in the supermarkets dense not full of air i covered them with pb2 \( those watching their weight can eat peanut butter for 45 calories a serving vs 190 for regular pb and it tastes exactly the same \) i too highly recommend these rice cakes . 
brew it correctly and you really get a beautiful cup of tea i highly recommend this brand it is by far the best bagged green tea i have found , and i have tried about all of them i brew one bag in a 12 oz mug for 2 minutes absolutely perfect . 
if you like green tea that brews for 2 minutes max and you do not stew your tea by just leaving the bag in until the tea is bitter , this is the tea for you ! of course , it can be done that way , but if you have refined tea taste , then you will like this tea i , personally , love the taste of a good green tea i am so glad to find this brand available online no one sells it in my area . 
i have tried many different brands of green tea , and this one is , by far , the best one that i have ever tried ! the taste is so delicious and each tea bag is tightly sealed in its own special packet , which keeps it totally fresh until you use it even the strings are totally natural , with no metal at all , which can affect the taste of the tea this is my new favorite tea , and i am so glad that i discovered it ! . 
i used to get these from sam 's wholesale club , but with this economy , i have not renewed my membership so long story short , i bought bumblebee canned clams and they were horrible so then i bought geisha baby clams and they were not as horrible , but i certainly would not put them in my clam chowder , so i returned all the unopened cans of bumblebee and geisha and am never ever gonna buy them again oh , you go right ahead and try those other brands if you do n't mind eating poop 'cause that 's about all you get clam juice , and clam poop doxee snow 's clams are all clams and clam juice no clam poop . 
this is the mother load of canned clams not just a can of juice with a few floaters , but cups and cups of chopped clams i found no sand residuals , and i was able to use every last drop of juices simply devine recipe on the can , best white clam sauce i 've ever made . 
i guess i thought of this can as being the usual commercial 10 can , so the price of about 16 a can did not seem too bad , but when they arrived i saw that these were somewhat smaller they are less than a half gallon i do n't see the size as that much of a problem all i have to do is rethink how i would use it in a recipe and free shipping helped with feeling better about the purchase , but if i saw that size can in a store i would not pay 16 00 for 51 oz can br br i would have to see what fresh clams would cost first i would like if they made the clams bigger chunks , but i could buy some fresh to add to it most clam chowder is made with bigger chunks than what snow makes br br good product despite the price ! . 
not much to say i ordered two large cans of chopped clams for some clam chowder that i will be making soon and they arrived in good condition and in a timely manner br br i have not opened them yet but will in february at my boss 's home in the country i will be making clam chowder in his kitchen with his wife 's blessings there will be a small group of us there and we will be shooting guns as part of the day 's activities i hope they like the clam chowder ! things could get ugly l o l . 
these are great beans for the price if you live in a big city , however , i 'd suggest buying green beans at a local ethiopian shop or even a community coop i also remember a pea berry out of east timor that was outstanding , but this tanzanian pea berry is comparable to standard beans . 
we have been using this food for about 6 months now and find it to be just excellent ! other than the fact our two dogs \( a coton de tulear 15lbs , and standard poodle puppy 40lbs \) both love the food , but are thriving their coats are in excellent condition and their overall structure is perfect good tasting to the dog and good for them and a good deal for the owner all around the best food we have ever used excellent ! ! ! . 
i'm glad my 45lb cocker standard poodle puppy loves the stuff because i trust the brand and its superior nutrition compare labels ! my previous feed \( pedigree \) was mostly corn my little dude is healthy and happy and high energy and has a glossy coat also , superior nutrition produces smaller , compact stools . 
i received the k cups on time and in execellant condition i usually drink coffee , but at night the hot cocoa is good with a snack , just before bed . 
this is the best hot cocoa i 've had in a k cup ! the taste is smooth and creamy it 's perfect for a cold morning or an evening hot drink i would definitely recommend this product the best part is that it can be ordered on auto delivery so i never run out . 
i'm pregnant and had to , give up my hot cup of coffee i thought maybe a hot cup of this will suffice \? sure does ! throw the kcup , in and this is the best hot choc ever ! i choke down my vitamins with it too ! worth it and so cheap here ! . 
this is quite the buy compared to other hot chocolates the kids love it quick and easy i will order this hot chocolate again . 
kids loved it great product at a great price my little one can make her own hot cocoa without my assistance . 
the hot chocolate is my husband 's favorite service was also great , as it usually is very popular now with winter coming on . 
i like the rich dark smooth taste of the grove square cocoa it is the best i have found in k cups and i have been on auto delivery for at least a few months now delicious ! . 
excellent coffee for people on a tight schedule my fiancee fell in love with my brother in law 's and had to have one ! now , everyone that visits our house has to try a cup and keeps coming back for more also like the fact that there 's a wide variety of coffee flavors to choose from . 
the kids love the hot cocoa and i like the fact that i can get the stuff shipped to me when i need it without worry of order . 
this was the best purchase that i could have made for my daughter it was priced beautifully and my daughter can study without worrying about the price for her college books thanks so much ! ! . 
as a chocoholic for many years i crave a good cup of hot chocolate this done in the keurig is really easy and fast the millk chocolate br is tasty and the dark chocolate tastes like the many cups of cocoa i had as a child not particularly carried away by the peppermint br flavor but it was not strong enough to matter . 
my family loves all three flavors the dark chocolate is my favorite the price was unbeatable i will buy this product again . 
it tastes good and is little sweet so my first thought was that it had a lot of sugar i looked on the box and was surprised that it did not have that much \( a plus for me \) . 
this is the best hot cocoa product i have found for the keurig k cup brewer the others i have tried do not have the test or alot of the product remains in the cup . 
they have some really good hot chocolate i got a single pack before and it was so good that i reordered some more i like to make a mocha by brewing one of these and then one coffee \( use a big cup \) br br one thing to note these dont have a strainer inside , the entire contents are meant to be used \( unlike the coffee kcups \) so it will feel empty once done i would not recommend brewing on the smaller cup settings use a standard mug or larger because the smaller settings wont get all the chocolate from the inside to come out br br also , kids may not like the peppermint flavor but that is my favorite one if you do n't want to get the variety pack , they sell the individual flavors too . 
i brew the 8 oz cups , 10 and 12 makes it too thin it 's good at that point but adding some creamer , whipped cream , and or cinamin always improves it . 
husband and grandaughter love this cocoa make it for them all the time as i drink my coffee my husband is a very picky person but for some reason he really likes this one product and wants me to keep it in stock here at the house loves it at night after dinner on cold evenings . 
these k cups are awesome they taste no different \( personally , i think better \) than those which are priced three times as much ! i highly recommend this product ! . 
i have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find grove square to be about the best of them all i usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers , my favorite being the sugar free caramel macchiato by adding the sugar free creamer the taste is there but not the calories . 
the most chocolatey and smooth hot cocoa ever , yum ! it has the best price and taste for the keurig k cup brewer way better then at least 3 other peicer brands we 've tried different ones and this is the best and super super fast delivery thanks . 
arrived quick and on time , and what a great value ! definitely pleased with my purchase , and will likely buy again \) . 
great option for excellent taste , price , and convenience a repeat customer on these ! we order these now in the 36 pack instead of getting at the grocery store . 
grove square hot cocoa is just the right amout of milk chocolate , not to much chocolate , just the right mixture delicious ! i say a good cup of hot chocolate try grove square hot cocoa , milk chocolate k cups for keurig coffee makers enjoy ! i did . 
this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on 8oz setting however its not the best i 've ever tasted nor the worst its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you do n't i my self happen to like it and will buy again unless i find something better . 
this is a great buy i love this hot chocolate because it is very low in sugar and has a good taste it is n't messy like regular hot chocolate as it is all dissolved before it hits the cup would buy again . 
yum ! all the convenience you expect with a k cup with all the flavor of real hot chocolate the kids love it , and so will you ! . 
i really like the flavor of this hot chocolate the kids love the flavor too i always keep a box of this in the house as my kids and their friends are avid coco drinkers this makes it easier and less messy even for the younger ones no more powder spilled on the counter tops this way ! . 
this is one of my wife 's favorite grove square has another great product to share with kcup users now we need some specials to bring the price per unit down . 
my husband and i both love this hot chocolate we are on the auto shipment for every other month and we are going to have to change it to every month ! . 
my family really enjoys grove square hot cocoa milk chocolate and we keep a supply on hand the excellent price is what made us choose this brand but the taste is what makes us continually renew our order . 
i have tried several types of hot chocolate since purchasing my keurig and this is by far the one i enjoy the most i have it shipped every month so that i do n't worry about running out ! ! ! . 
i liked the milk chocolate version , so tried this it is just as good , and with the more intense chocolate flavor , appeals to my chocolate desires . 
after trying several brands of hot cocoa my kids have decided that this is the one for them i'm certainly happy about it because not only is it delicious , but it 's also more affordable 3 boys can consume a box of hot cocoa very quickly , even with limits set it 's also very convenient to have it shipped automatically if we do n't drink that much i simply skip a month if friends come over and we drink a lot , i just order an extra box it 's quick , simple and delicious . 
to everyone worried about not getting a full cup to run through your machine with these k cups , here 's the trick put it in your machine , close the lid , open the lid , turn 90 degrees , close the lid and repeat two more times you should have closed the lid on the k cup four times by now next step is to hit the brew button the problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through with the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to could have been a little thicker overall , but not bad . 
the greatest , best chocolate taste in any keurig k cups out there will definitely order more everyone in the office tries to steal them i'm a chocolate nut , and these pass the test . 
i have tried different brands of hot cocoa from dark to milk and the grove square milk chocolate k cups have by far been the best they 're big critics in my family and they have given two thumbs up i would recommend anyone who enjoys hot cocoa to purchase this brand . 
great product for keurig coffee maker works fine with coffees and cocoa mixtures is good for just hot chocolate like purchase price . 
i enjoy the selection and they have all met my expectations so far my sister wioll not try any favor but milk chocolate but i am glad i brought the variety pack anyway . 
this hot chocolate is much better than other k cup hot chocolates i have tried it is not watery i have tried both the milk and dark chocolate version and like them both . 
so far grove square has the best hot chocolate k cups we have tried a couple others but they do n't compare . 
when i was talking to a neighbor about getting a keurig she told me not to get cocoa this was in a group of beverages that i got when i ordered my keurig and i think it is very good it is rich , creamy , and exactly what i want when i want a cup of cocoa ! i would order this again . 
this hot chocolate is very good it has just the right amount of milk chocolate flavor the price is a very good deal and more than worth it ! . 
i do n't ven know why i ordered these , it was just on a whim but what a surprise when i brewed myself some hot chocolate the taste was unbelievable , just like homemade maybe a tad too sweet , but a tiny little bit of instant coffee added to it did the trick love it . 
this item has an awesome chocolate flavor i would recommend this product to anyone looking for hot chocolate for their keurig or any machine that uses k cups great product . 
ordered this in the colder weather and it was great in the morning very easy and fast to prepare in k cups . 
the grove square hot coco k cups have a good flavor but i find that the k cups do not have enough hot coco mix to make that perfect cup thus i recommend putting a little less water in order to make each cup just right . 
after drinking swiss miss watered down hot chocolates taste for so long , this is a very tasty creamy hot chocolate my kids love it so i tried it and its the best i had in a while i will be ordering more . 
a pleasant surprise awaited me when i first ordered grove square milk chocolate hot cocoa cups not a coffee drinker , br i use our keurig k cup brewer mostly to make cocoa , and a few other brands i tried simply did not hit the mark grove square cocoa tasted full flavored , with just enough chocolate essence to make it a perfect drink the first experience made me anticipate \( with pleasure \) the next time i popped a grove square k cup into the machine ! . 
grove street has the absolute best hot chocolate for the keurig you should always have hot chocolate available to soothe away the days anxieties ! . 
my mom and son love the flavor of this hot chocolate add a little bit of milk afterwards and 1 splenda and the taste is amazing . 
i was hesitant to try this cocoa after all the horrible reviews about how it tasted so bad , and had a really bad sucralose flavor i do n't know if i'm just not as picky as others or what it is , but i thought this hot cocoa was really good creamy and rich , and almost too sweet i do n't think it has an aftertaste though , how some have described i used the middle water setting on my keurig or small mug 7 25 oz , i guess everyone has their own tastes and preferences , but as for me , i really like this product ! . 
this is hands down the best tasting k cup hot chocolate available the cafe escapes or whatever the brand name is tastes very watered down and artificial , while this one tastes thicker and milkier i love the dark chocolate flavor , although if i did n't know it was n't dark i probably could n't have told the difference between it and a regular cup of cocoa i will stick with the flavor just because it will probably be richer than the milk chocolate option these are such a hit at my house when the weather is cool everyone always wants hot chocolate ! br br something to note on this is that these work much better when used with about 6 oz per k cup i use 2 k cups per mug and the flavor is much better than when i try one \( too watery \) . 
my grandson loves this he makes a cup everytime he stops over it quick and easy and the taste is good . 
as far as single serve cocoas go , this is one of the best i would n't say it 's as good as some of the handmade ones , but it 's still good ! . 
nice variety pack has 3 dofferent hot chocolates in one package milk , dark and peppermint nice holiday feel good for company during the season . 
we received this order in perfect condition i purchased this product for my mother in law she likes the convenience of the product in the keurig coffee maker the chocolate does not stick to the sides of the cup like the cheap hot chocolate in the paper bags overall it tastes pretty good it is a little weak but good use only on the small cup setting in the keurig 4 stars . 
i bought this because it was a very good price it was really good though i love mixing a peppermint with a dark chocolate and having a double sized up of hot cocoa br br will keep buying this until they do n't sell it anymore it is really creamy i like it best with 6 ounces of water , gives it a thicker feel . 
i was disappointed by the fact that all three boxes i received had already expired luckily enough , the flavors had not yet degraded br br i specifically bought these in order to get the peppermint flavor i was hoping for more the peppermint hot chocolate does not have much peppermint flavor to it , but we will still enjoy it and both of the other flavors . 
i keep this on hand for the young at heart we enjoy a cup almost every night good taste will buy again . 
this is delicious hot chocolate it is best at 8 oz cup , but can be stretched to 10 and 8oz of strong coffee and you have delicious mocha . 
i 've had many hot cocoa k cups and i must say this one is the best by far the green mountain one has a half half bitter aftertaste while the grove square is very pleasant and is as close as you can get without actually using milk . 
i really like this hot chocolate mix i was concerned , when i read some of the reviews , that i would not like it but i like it alot to me it has just the right amount of chocolate and is not to sweet i would recommend this product . 
the hot cocoa is delicious and is strong enough to make the larger size i find all three flavors delicious with my favorite being the dark cocoa the best bang for the buck i have so far found for hot cocoa i tend to use my coffee maker for everything but coffee . 
very good hot chocolate i have tried a few different brands , and this one is the best i have tried should be priced higher for the quality you get . 
i 've been buying this milk hot chocolate for months now and it 's one of the best i 've had i even got my in laws hooked on it and my granddaughters absolutely love it ! great price , great product ! . 
just what i was looking for tired of going to the store to pick these up and always being sold out ! i love the flavor not so sweet and just right ! ! thank you ! and will be buying again ! ! . 
i was a little skeptical when i bought this , but it has really been a great purchase the cocoa is delicious ! it 's so easy to just make my daughter and i some cocoa quickly before sitting down to watch a movie i did n't have to add anything to it , but i did add a tiny bit of milk just to cool it down i would definitely recommend this product and purchase it again . 
i did n't read the reviews thoroughly and found out too late that this product has enough sugar to give it 60 calories and 11 grams of carbohydrate in each cup i tried one with a bit of cream and found it to be very tasty i 'll keep it around for friends and family or perhaps an occasional mini splurge i 'd like to see amazon include nutritional info in the future . 
this is really tasty hot chocolate i like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference . 
good value for the money these are good the hot cocoa is excellent however , do n't get the coffee cuz its instant ! . 
not bad at all when i use coffeemate chocolate creamer br i still like swiss mix made with 2 milk a little better br but as far k cups go , this milk chocolate with the coffeemate chocolate creamer is not bad br and currently , it is less than 11 00 for 24 cups . 
my boyfriend and i really like these k cups we have tried others and they were kind of gross these are the ones we will stick with ca n't go wrong . 
this is a great hot cocoa as long as you read the box and only use the 8oz setting on your coffee make otherwise it will taste watered down also it is an instant coffee so dont be surprised by it . 
a good cup of hot chocolate with a couple of marshmellows make it for my daughter every time she visits she is nearly 60 , and she loves it . 
all three flavors have a nice aroma and rich chocolate taste peppermint is our favorite we enjoy a cup after dinner 'flavored' with a bit of creme liquor nearly every night it 's become a tasty habit . 
this item had a great price and tastes great the only thing that could make this product better is if the little plastic cup was recyclable or compostable . 
my husband and i really like this cocoa i add extra milk to my cup for a creamier flavor , but the convenience cannot be beat . 
great deal , especially for the price item arrived quicker than anticipated this has saved me many trips to dunkin doniuts as well as saving me paying double the price for a cup of hot chocolate that 's just as good looking for more to stockpile ! . 
love them hardly notice any aftertaste from sweetener i do n't agree with some of the others that did n't like it will buy again . 
wow what a deal these taste just as good as the expensive brands most definately will be buying these again . 
i feel like i 've tried every hot cocoa there is in the k cups while i do think this is the best hot cocoa so far , it still is n't great i'm not sure what it is , but all of the cocoa k cups seem to have a weird taste to them it 's almost like there is artificial sweetener in them , , but i know there is not br i set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa this has more body to it than others br i'm still waiting and hoping that dunkin' donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k cup there really is nothing better than that br if you want a k cup hot cocoa , i would def recommend this over all the others . 
these grove square hot cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the keurig we took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good br br dark chocolate my favorite , very good even on the large cup setting br milk chocolate excellent on the small cup and good on the large cup setting br peppermint everyone likes this one , on either cup size setting br br these do contain sucralose in addition to sugar , i do n't notice the taste but my wife does \( but she still likes them \) br br highly recommended ! br br cfh . 
excellent product ! a tip from the keurig people shake the k cup before using it this prevents the cocoa from clumping and results in more flavor . 
i have read some really funny reviews about this product some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup , so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix ! brilliant deduction , sherlock ! what did you expect to see choco grounds in the cup \? yes , it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route , that 's why 4 instead of 5 stars br br but the taste is what you want to know about , right \? the dark chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you 'll have a real treat ! it comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer not surprisingly , the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too so , maybe a few mini marshmallows instead of a full sized one for this flavor oh , and definitely go 6 oz cup my oldest granddaughter and i contest for the peppermint chocolate she wins , of course , but it 's pretty good when i can get one no marshmallow needed the hint of peppermint is just enough 6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go , too br br i think i got the cups sizes right if i did n't , you 'll figure it out btw , i 'd imagine the reason it 's always out of stock is because people keep buying it ! i 've dipped into the supply well a few times myself pretty good pretty cheap pretty hard to get at times i 'll buy it again ! . 
everyone in my family likes hot cocoa i was running plain water through my k cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids did n't really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow so i decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time no overflow the taste is good , its creamy with enough cocoa to water ratio for my kids i will be ordering this product from now on for my family br in the interest of product comparison , we have ordered timothy 's white hot chocolate , and green mountain hot cocoa , timothy 's was great , but pricy , and green mountain did n't really taste all that great to our family it had a watered down taste to it . 
when i weigh the convenience of a k cup against the price and the taste , i would characterize these as a winner not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet , these are pretty darn good they nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that i 've had with some other brands do not select 10 oz on your machine though make it only at 6 or 8 oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion all in all a fine cup of hot chocolate . 
i am actually surprised at how good this product is i am a cuisinart keurig owner with two teens that love to drink hot cocoa and cider pretty much year round br br price point the price for these at the store \( exact brand \) is almost triple of what we pay here for the same amount , with subscribe and save this makes these quite affordable for my family use in comparison to other more expensive brands it 's a great bargain without sacrificing quality over quantity br br flavor wise my kids love it , and have already asked me to purchase more my daughter says that the peppermint is right on and not too weak even if using a larger cup i love the dark chocolate in my coffee to make a mocha \( 10oz coffee to 4 oz chocolate \) and it 's much better than some other brands that i have tried in the past br br overall impression great value , good flavor , excellent price point i will be purchasing more . 
ordered on a whim my first grove square purchase great for the family 's occasional cocoa desire being a k cup it 's fast and easy was a little worried the cocoa might leave some after taste in my coffee , so far so good great cup of dark , rich cocoa maybe could taste a little better if it was from a gourmet brand you mix yourself with steamed milk the ease and simplicity , and lack of clean up , make this a better option for me will order again nice to see it on subscribe and save . 
my box of grove square hot cocoa arrived today and i 've just tried it delicious made a big cup by mistake but i'm happy with the flavor and consistency no off tastes that i can discern a little disappointed at high sodium content nice to have as fall starts to chill . 
ok this is not the finest european chocolate but , you can make it in your keurig and all 3 flavors taste good i 've joined the club and get the lowest possible cost no charge to join and no effort to quit why not \? it 's nice to have when you 're dieting , because it 's just enough chocolate to keep you on track non dieters will like it for the convenience . 
i 've tried a few different hot cocoa brands for my keurig and have been disappointed every time , until now ! cocoa brews smooth and full flavored on either the small cup size or the medium ! i add a splash of almond milk and i'm ready to go \) perfect ! i 'll definitely buy this again . 
i recieved a keurig k cup brewer for christmas with sample cups of coffee and tea but no cocoa so i tried this brand and i like them but i have n't tried other brands yet to compare with i would buy these again until i find one i like better . 
i see a lot of complaints about grove square hot chocolate i think it tastes ok considering it 's a k cup , not homemade and not gourmet i do n't have anything negative to say the company or the product , it 's relatively inexpensive and the company did n't falsely advertise or make any promises about the taste . 
i really like hot cocoa ! i like it sooo much that i have a cocoa latte machine , which is great , but sometimes i just want one cup of cocoa not a whole pitcher when that happens i used to put on the kettle and heat up the water , then pour in a packet of cocoa mix and stir , and stir , and stir and after all that stirring , i 'd still get little lumps in my cocoa with the k cups , i get smooth rich cocoa with no lumps and no clean up easy and yummy ! br br please note these are not sugar free the very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and i did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients each cup has only 60 calories , but if you want sugar free or are diabetic then this product is probably not for you . 
very good hot cocoa and price was right br br awesome and passing the word on the item will buy it again . 
the thing i like most about this brand of hot chocolate is that once i remove it from the keurig , it does n't leak all over the place for some reason , all the hot chocolates i 've purchased before leak all over when you remove them from the coffee pot my coffee does n't do that so not sure why that is this is a great deal for the amount you get as well , and taste yummy ! . 
i found this brand and the fact that it was dark chocolate made it by far the best i 've had for my keurig i will continue to order this particular brand . 
i love these hot chocolates i think they 're way better than the cafe express hot chocolates these and the swiss miss hot chocolate are my favorite k cups and the price of these are the best i 've been able to find my girlfriend and i have already gone through about half of them in about two weeks , and i never used to drink much hot chocolate br i recommend these . 
i really enjoy this hot chocolate with a little fat free half half for creaminess being that i am not a coffee drinker these k cups offer a nice change from tea the local stores sell this as well but it 's half the amount of cups and almost the same price buy from amazon . 
i like to brew a k cup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha this dark chocolate flavor is quite nice , especially mixed with double black diamond coffee though not the very best , it is good , and the price is right , compared to other brands . 
taste was decent , a little sugary , but very creamy otherwise very happy with this product i will be buying this product again packaging interesting , as it 's a giant box for the product to float around in until it delivers to your house . 
grove square hot chocolate is the best k cup hot chocolate i read many reviews before making this purchase , and now i agree , and will continue to buy this brand . 
my kids have been begging for hot cocoa k cups and when i found these so reasonably priced i decided to give them a try we all loved them . 
all three tastes rich and chocolaty , not chalky at all we were surprised how good they are , better than any other k cup cocoa we 've tried . 
this brand is by far the best k cup hot cocoa not that that says much , but it is thicker and less disgusting than the rest . 
you ca n't beat this deal ! 3 boxes of 16 k cups for little more then 20 no other store can even match that price for hot chocolate k cups your normally going to be paying around 12 16 for 16 k cups alone this package give you 48 k cups for a great price br br the hot chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the b70 except for the travel mug low in calories and great tasting defiantly a must have if you own a keurig brewing system ! . 
not too sweet the best k cup hot chocolate i 've tried thus far the kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate . 
grove square is the best k cup hot cocoa i 've tried and i 've tried a number of the other brands this tastes like real cocoa used to taste and if you add a little milk it 's even better it 's so hot from the keurig that the milk helps cool it down anyway if your looking for a real chocolate ly flavor give this a try . 
best hot chocolate available for k cups best taste , after taste great in any size when brewed highly recommend over any other company . 
of the few hot cocoa flavors we 've tried , this is the best so far it has the richest flavor and i dont notice the artificial taste that others have commented on its also very affordable compared to other k cups right now i thought that the k cup making process must have gotten more expensive over the last year , but now i know they are truely sticking it to us since these are still reasonable priced . 
this is the absolute best hot cocoa for the keurig brewers all of the other hot cocoa 's that we have tried we had to doctor to make them taste good we had to add more cocoa and more sugar i was pretty much making my own cocoa , which defeated the purpose of the brewer but the grove square hot cocoa does not need any help in my opinion , it has just the right amount of flavor ! ! . 
oh so good the first cup i had was on the medium setting it was too sweet so i had my second on the larger setting and it was perfect ! this is a creamy hot chocolate add a little milk and and whipped cream , and your set ! ! ! ! . 
i was quite pleased with e flavor of this product a good , strong , yet not overpowering flavor rich chocolate flavor very pleasing i highly recomend this product ! . 
i'm giving this product 5 stars because i think it is great considering that it is made with water the hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then brew using the smallest possible cup size if you want a large cup of hot chocolate , use 2 k cups it is fairly low in calories , most likely because artificial sweeteners are necessary to get all the ingredients into the little k cup . 
better than expected , but the peppermint flavor lacks a mint smell or taste this is a good purchase for the price . 
kcups are a godsend among kcups , these are near the top br br the keurig brewer is a blessing , hot beverages in seconds , mostly coffee but there are greater and lesses among the coffees , and so , it seems , among the hot cocoas br br this is so rich and vibrant , it announces itself from two rooms away silky , smooth , bursting with all the things chocolate is supposed to deliver , it 's a must have in this household . 
this is the best hot cocoa i have tried for the keurig rich , chocolate flavor \( i used the 6oz setting \) and it is not watery if you like hot cocoa , and the convenience of a k cup , this is the one to get ! . 
grove square milk chocolate cocoa k cups are great ! i usually make hot cocoa from scratch with milk over the stove i thought this was easier and delicious to add creaminess i put in either a splash of milk or a shot of whipped cream perfect ! . 
i ordered the hot cocoa for my grandson for christmas he loves the flavor and is able to make it on his own delivery was good , i had it in several days but still in plenty of time for christmas would recommend to anyone . 
love this brand great price with save and subscribe my husband loves them top with whipped cream in a can and i have a happy man i wish you could buy all pepermint cocoa . 
great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k cups have i 've tasted several and this by far is the better one , but i have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down will definitely purchase more , but at the rate my family downs these , we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective . 
i ordered this as a christmas present for my daughter and son in law he tried it the day after christmas and gave it 2 thumbs up . 
i bought a box of grove square hot cocoa because i love their cappuccino french vanilla i used the medium cup setting and added some whipped cream it was to die for very yummy and almost as good as homemade i never noticed an aftertaste like other reviews , but it could be because of the redi whip i added to it i highly recommend it . 
my wife rates this 5 stars she is the chocoholic in the family and if you please her you please everybody . 
i love the flavor that this hot chocolate has it is very rich and smooth have tried other brands but did not get the results i wanted i will definately be ordering from this company again . 
got a brand new keurig machine for christmas and immediately went to work finding the cheapest and best tasting k cups on the market i came across this when searching for some good hot cocoa and am amazed at how many k cups you really get out of this 48 k cups for about 20 when i purchased was a great deal when most hot chocolate prices were 16 k cups for 15 19 br br this is a great deal and you get to try out peppermint , dark chocolate and milk chocolate it 's light on calories and most important of all taste great ! br br must have if your a hot chocolate lover or have family that wants a easy to make , great tasting hot chocolate for less ! . 
fantastic cocoa all the flavors are excellent but my personal favorite is the dark chocolate i received my keurig as a christmas present and i am loving cocoa at the end of the work day no mixing , no microwave and positively no pot on the stove just warm , chocolatey goodness on demand will order this product again . 
after trying many of the other hot cocoa k cup options , i find that the grove square product tastes the best for my personal taste , i find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat however , this is not hot chocolate , which may be a turn off for some tasters . 
i have tried a number of k cup hot chocolates and grove square is by far the best yet ! very nice flavor , doesnt have the nasty artificial sweetener flavor like a lot of the kcup hot chocolates very impressed ! . 
i enjoy a good cup of hot cocoa on occasion , and this is good stuff ! ! not only that but in a time where prices are out of control on k cups , this product is very reasonable in price . 
i bought these for my mom and she loves it she mixed eggnog with the dark chocolate she enjoyed melting pepermint candies in too . 
i bought this mostly because i wanted the peppermint hot cocoa , but i fell in love with the milk chocolate one the peppermint was pretty good as well good cocoa ! ! ! . 
sometimes , i 'd rather have cocoa instead of coffee at work this meets my cocoa craving i do not need to add sugar just add water and brew ! . 
everything you 'd want from a hot chocolate creamy , milky , tasty , makes you happy \) i ca n't wait to try the other flavors ! . 
i have tried many brands of the hot chocolates but this by far has been the best now , i realize it is thousand percent cheaper to just use the package you can buy at the store and add water but if you want to impress than this is the product . 
having tried all the varieties of hot chocolate k cups , grove square 's are by far the best they are very chocolaty , rich , creamy , and leave very little sludge in the bottom of your cup yum . 
i must say i was pleasantly surprised i do n't drink coffee and i was searching for more hot chocolates for my keurig i am a milk chocolate fan , but with grove square the peppermint and dark chocolate are by far the better choice both have a sweetness i was n't expecting the flavor is great and i do n't want to share i am definitely reordering more . 
this is by far the best hot cocoa i have found yet for the keurig i love the assortment and the peppermint is my favorite i would give these try for sure if you are looking for some hot cocoa k cups all the other selections for hot cocoa that i have tried were just okay tasting these are amazing ! ! ! ! love them ! i will order these for sure again ! . 
after being disgusted by the brown water created by the cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa , we were thrilled to find these dark chocolate cocoa k cups delicious ! . 
this is the best keurig k cup hot chocolate you can buy i 've tried others , but will never buy any other brand again . 
this hot chocolate tasted very good ! the whole family liked it ! ! ! it is a nice change to make hot chocolate instead of coffee inthe keurig coffee maker we wold purchase this again . 
we had previously tried another brand of hot coca k cups we bought these since they seemed to be a pretty good value we actually like the taste and flavor of these more than the other brand we tried they have just the right amount of cocoa and sweetness we like the variety of flavors in the pack also . 
i am so glad that this hot chocolate is available for keurig previously the brand of hot chocolate available was only so so , but this is definitely better the variety pack is just right for every mood and every guest i never find myself with too much of any one flavor left over move over coffee lovers , we cocoa drinkers have found a home ! . 
i have tried a few of the cocoa cups and find this product about average unless you stir the cup the cocoa will taste watery for a few sips . 
i 've heard over and over that people are having a difficult time finding a hot chocolate pod to enjoy in their keurig k cup brewers the search is over ! this grove square hot cocoa received four big smiles from my sons they just went on and on about how delicious it was ! i love having this new coffee pot where it 's fast and convenient for all of us ! super happy with this purchase . 
reasonable in price , tastes good prefect for keurig , which can be pricey we will probably buy this again it is mostly for the kiddos anyway ! . 
these are so nice and creamy ! usually i do n't justify buying k cups for things like cocoa that you can get cheaper in a packet , but this is so convenient and very good tasting way better than most powdered cocoa packets i 've tried as far as price comparison , it is equivalent to gourmet types of cocoa that would easily cost 1 per packet i also like that it comes in a variety pack with 3 flavor options highly recommend . 
i ordered this wanting to try a hot chocolate on my keurig , and i am very happy with this product i will definitely be ordering it again that being said , i dislike hot chocolate made completely of water , so i do add a splash of half and half to my cup when i make this thus , i did n't want to give it a 5 star rating since i do doctor my cup up a bit at home \( otherwise i would have \) however , i wo n't even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water , i use 100 milk usually for those and they still do n't measure up to this product from grove square so , the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes i do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that i have ever tried at home compared to the swiss miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it i'm a big fan ! . 
great product at a reasonable price my husband 's favorite ! loves the dark chocolate although we get the pack of 3 that includes light , dark and peppermint also shopped around and this is a bargain and surpasses the other cocoa k cups we have tried in taste . 
i bought this item for my elderly mom , to use with the new keurig coffee machine i purchased for her she loves it ! ! ! ! ! ! i will be ordering more ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . 
bought this as a gift and was told it tastes really great ! too bad i do n't have one of those machines , otherwise , i 'd try them out myself i might have to consider getting one ! if you really like it , you can save some money by subscribing to it for automatic deliveries and to make sure you do n't run out . 
this is great hot chocolate not watery like some others and my husband really likes this one thank you pat greenough , boise , id . 
we love this variety box in our house , we subscribe to ensure we never run out i use the 'dark' to make mocha , my wife loves the 'peppermint' and i drink the 'milk' whenever i fancy a hot chocolate br br the dark makes a great mocha , just do half a cup of the dark cocoa and half a cup of your favorite coffee , add whipped cream on top , delicious also worth noting , you can try some of the flavored coffees in your mocha and rustle up some great combos i am not a fan of flavored coffee , i struggle to drink a cup but as a mocha , delightful br br drinking the peppermint or milk as a hot chocolate , we add a little milk and whipped cream on top , delicious br br i highly recommend this variety box if you are considering buying it \) . 
i 've tried ever single brand of k cup hot chocolate and this is absolutely the best one it is the only one that actually tastes like the real stuff . 
great price for the 24 count , my dad will love this gift since he loves hot chocolate and drinks about three cups a day , quick to receive . 
it appears a little watery , but the taste is not bad at all if you have kids that are as fascinated by the keurig as you are , they 'll probably enjoy this . 
i enjoy this cocoa very much , the children love it and drink it often i would purchase this product again . 
for the price i think the cocoa cups are very good i will order them again they are nice to have in the house for the grand children and the holidays . 
great tasting product and is much better than other cocoas i have tasted in this type of single serve job well dont grove square ! . 
this is the best cocoa ever it beats out anything you can buy in the store sometimes br i just mix it in my coffee and it 's wonderful highly recommend . 
it 's a pretty good sub for the coffee shop version no mess and the s s price is great ! i like that the box has perforations to remove part of the side so that it functions as a dispenser . 
this is actually better than i expected when i paid less than 50 cents each we usually use a packet mix and hot water from the brewer this is much easier and the taste is comparable if you are very particular you may not like this but for something quick , sweet , chocolate flavored and warm for around 50 cents it is worth a try i would not buy it at the regular price that some retailers ask . 
getting really good cocoa out of a k cup is not easy but this is much better than the others i have tried still a little wattery , but at 60 calories it is a nice treat very rich flavor not as good as the real thing , bit i am not drinking it in a berlin chocolate shop either put your slippers on , sit in front of the fireplace with your sweetie , and enjoy ! br br 60 cal \( 20 fat \) 2g fat sat 11 carb 6g sugar lt 1g fiber . 
this hot chocolate is great am so glad i doubled the order , you can not miss with this now i have quick hot chocolate for the kids and grandkids . 
we recieved the product on time and in excellent shape it tastes good and meets our expectations thanks for the excellent service . 
funny thing i bought some of these k cups several weeks ago based on the strength of the reviews at that time i just got them last week and have had a few cups since then i'm using 8 ounces of water to prepare the cocoa i thought they tasted pretty good reasonably chocolaty and smooth br br they were sweet , but not overly so , and the richness made me check the calorie count on the box 60 calories hey , not too bad ! it was n't until now that i came back to place a review and i read the most recent reviews from others did i realize they use artificial sweetener honestly , if i had n't read it i would have never known i did n't detect anything that gave me the hint when i drank it br br i think if you like a quick cocoa on the run you 'll be happy enough with these k cups are they as good as a swiss miss packet from costco \? maybe not , but in my office i do n't want to deal with getting powder on the counters and needing a spoon to get things mixed you 'll sacrifice a little for the convenience , but to me it 's well worth it . 
everything about the order went great , the hot chocolate is very good i will be ordering this again probaly soon . 
i am amazed how well these little cups taste these kcups taste very well this hot chocolate taste great and are ready in one minute . 
i recently purchased a keurig and i bought the cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa from their site , and it was not chocolately and had a strange aftertaste i saw the grove square brand and thought i would give it a try since i got 36 kcups for less than the 24 from keurig i received my purchase yesterday and immediately opened it up to try it the cocoa actually has sugar in it and the chocolately flavor is much better than the cafe escapes i will be ordering this one again , and i hope my guest will drink the other kind to get rid of it ! . 
we have tried many of the different hot cocoa k cups everything always tasted so watered down , even when using the smallest setting on the machine however , this brand even at the medium cup setting , tasted fantastic i highly recommend grove square i have n't tried any of their other products , but i would be inclined to now based on this cocoa . 
these grove square hot cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the keurig we took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good br br dark chocolate my favorite , very good even on the large cup setting br milk chocolate excellent on the small cup and good on the large cup setting br peppermint everyone likes this one , on either cup size setting br br these do contain sucralose in addition to sugar , i do n't notice the taste but my wife does \( but she still likes them \) br br highly recommended ! we tried these in the smaller variety pack , a href http www amazon com gp product b005k4q64k grove square hot cocoa cups variety pack , k cups for keurig brewers , 12 count \( pack of 3 \) a br br cfh . 
perhaps not your grandma 's cup of hot chocolate , but for the keurig , it 's the best out there and what makes it a sweeter deal you get 3 packs for the typical price of 1 k cup box , take note it 's a pack of 3 , so a total of 36 k cups br br i suggest only using the small cup setting to prevent it from being watered down too much , but decide for yourself ! . 
truthfully , i was n't expecting too much with this , but thought i would give it a try for something different for my keurig i have to say , that i was pleasantly surprised at how good this is my favorite is the dark chocolate , but the peppermint is very good as well i am not a real milk chocolate fan , but i mixed it with some coffee for a mocha and it was very good i would definitely purchase this again . 
as you know finding a hot chocolate that taste great and is brewed on the keurig is a big challenge well this hot chocolate is quite good the flavor is rich and the hot chocolate has some creaminess to it i made it for my daughter and toped it off with whipped cream and she loved it will be drinking lots of this on now that it is begining to get colder . 
although this is n't a perfect cup of cocoa , it 's far superior to the others that i have tried i will order this again . 
this is by far the best k cup hot cocoa we have tried it has a nice rich flavor and with the added convenience of a k cup , it is easy to have a cup anytime you like highly recommend ! . 
out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that i have tried this is by far the best one not weird aftertaste , and not watered down tastes amazing and priced fairly , what more could you ask for \? . 
these k cups are just what my son wanted ! the price was excellent and the flavor is rich i would recommend these to anyone wanting a good cup of instant hot cocoa . 
i am a big hot cocoa drinker so this hot cocoa i would definitely recommend it has a great cocoa flavor and it 's perfect for those cold fall or winter days warms you up plus tastes great ! . 
i mainly use my keurig for coffee but thought i 'd try this one since i love dark chocolate and it was getting mostly good reviews i 've tried some other chocolate k cups and had given up on them since they all seemed pretty watery if i can taste water i do n't consider it real hot chocolate i was pleasantly surprised that this tastes much better than the others i 've tried \( i must admit there are many i have n't tried , but i do n't really feel like making a big scientific study of it \) this will be my source of hot chocolate from now on br br i was a little disappointed to see how many ingredients it contains that sort of thing worries me a little still , i do n't drink hot chocolate that much , so i think i 'll survive i 'll copy the ingredient label here for those concerned plus a few items from the nutrition info br br calories 60 , from fat 20 trans fat 0g sodium 200mg sugars 6g br br ingredients sugar , glucose syrup solids , cocoa \( processed with alkali \) , partially hydrogenated vegetable oil \( may contain coconut , soybean , sunflower , palm and or canola \) , modified whey , maltodextrin , salt , natural and artificial flavors , cellulose gum , sodium caseinate , cornstarch , lactose , dipotassium phosphate , sucralose , mono and diglycerides , silicon dioxide , soy lecithin , artificial color contains milk and soy br br \( i always hate seeing artificial coloring in dark chocolate products \) br br if i had hot chocolate every day i would consider making it from scratch with more cocoa and fewer chemicals , but since i enjoy the convenience of having it nearly instantly from my keurig on the occasional whim , i 'll just keep a box of these k cups on hand i highly recommend it for the taste , it is n't easy finding good hot chocolate . 
i have n't actually tried drinking these just as hot cocoa but i know the peppermint flavor is great as a creamer for the van houtte mexican coffee i'm ordering another box as this adds just the right amount of chocolate to my coffee been trying to find a coffee flavor that does that but so far adding these to the coffee has worked out better \) i usually have 14 oz at a time so i run 4 oz through as hot chocolate and the other 10 as coffee i did try another brand of kcup hot cocoa and it was n't as good as this brand . 
we have a new hot beverage cooker this thing is the closest thing to the futuristic replicators , made know via star trek movies and series of various efforts br br we love our hot beverage brewer and have added a higher end unit to our own home environment br br we 've used such a device and various coffee and tea pods over the last few years , but this kit tops that experience br br i especially like the hot chocolate and tea beverages apart from the hundreds of coffee options br br do consider buying one of their devices and also sample the so very many flavors of coffees , teas and other hot beverages attached to the brewing station . 
i 'd never heard of this brand but they were very cheap here on amazon and i was extremely surprised at how good the dark chocolate hot cocoa is absolutely worth trying , it 's really quite good . 
this is really great hot chocolate the price is right too usually i find that hot chocolate k cups are weak or watery but not this one i was impressed the dark chocolate is really yummy ! i will be ordering more . 
we use our keurig every day when a friend gave us a sample we went crazy , it is the best hot chocolate ever i highly recommend this , it is a treat in the evening to take the place of dessert . 
compared to other k cup products , grove square offers tasty products at a reasonable price this hot cocoa was rich and delicious ! . 
great ! hot chocolate ! by far the best kcup hot chocolate i have found i use a little milk or half and half and it 's so good i definitely will order again ! thanks for the super fast shipping ! . 
my whole family loves this product , often times we struggle to find something like this that we can all have \( some members of my family have severe nut allergies \) this product is nut free and clearly states what the ingredients are . 
unlike some others , this is actually in a k cup and not just an overpriced version of swiss miss while the flavor is not super premium like a godiva or ghiradhelli , it is better than your average instant mix and much better than the other weak k cup versions i 've had the sucralose does give it an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweetness of a commercial cake mix , but it is n't unpleasant br br i like to brew this on the smallest setting \( 4oz \) and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave , i think that gives a richer taste the peppermint is my favorite , followed by the dark and then the light chocolate they are all very good my only wish is that i could buy the peppermint on its own and not in a combo pack only . 
these are the only kind of cocoa k cups i have tried , as i have a fairly new machine my only complaint is that it seems like the taste of chocolate in the milk chocolate version needs a bit of a boost however , i usually add another teaspoon of regular cocoa mix and the taste is great the peppermint and dark chocolate k cups are delicious definitely worth a shot for this great price ! . 
whole family liked all three flavors we 've had some of the other brands of hot chocolates and they were good also but just could n't get myself to pay that much for hot chocolate the price was right on these for sure but i was skeptical after reading reviews on the coffees made by this brand but it 's just hot chocolate so i figured what the heck all three are actually plenty chocolaty on the biggest size serving honestly , i think they 're a little bit better than the other brands we 've had . 
what i really like about this selection is the choice of three different hot cocoa chocolates my favorite is the mint chocolate for it not only tastes like mint chocolate but it has the aroma of a hot mint chocolate the milk chocolate and dark chocolate are equally flavorful as well the price through amazon is very reasonable . 
very good hot chocolate nice rich flavor we used the smallest setting on our keurig , and made sure to shake it to make sure the powder was loose in the k cup the k cup was completely empty after brewing there is sucralose in it , but i could not detect the aftertaste of it i'm pretty sensitive to that aftertaste i will buy this product again br br here are facts on the box br br calories 60 , fat \( saturated \) 2g , sodium 220mg , carbs 11g , fiber lt 1g , sugars 6g , protein 1g \( if it 's not listed it is 0 \) br br the ingredients list for this is br sugar , glucose syrup solid , cocoa \( processed with alkali \) partially hydrogenated vegetable oil \( may contain coconut , soybean , sunflower , palm and or canola \) , nonfat dry milk , modified whey , maltodextrin , salt , natural and artificial flavors , cellulose gum , sodium caseinate , cornstarch , lactose , dipotassium phosphate , sucralose , mono and diglycerides , silicone dioxide , silicon dioxide , soy lecithin , artificial color contains milk and soy . 
the price is wonderful ! the hot cocoa tastes great in 6 and 8 oz but 10oz was a bit watery to me br dark chocolate yum br milk chocolate is very yummy br peppermint for me was n't enough peppermint but i just add a candy cane to mine br i would recommend this again and plan on ordering more soon ! . 
unlike the other hot chocolate \( s \) , this one does not have that obnoxious after taste what a relief when i purchased my keurig it came with a box of 16 hot chocolate k cups \( name not used to protect the guilty \) , that have the most indescribable , particularly unpleasant after taste , all due to the fake sugar that seems to comprise most if not all of the product br br this manufacturer does use some sucralose , but no where near the amount that other uses in fact , it actually tastes like hot chocolate during and after the sipping whoohoo ! ! ! ! br br will be ordering more thank you for my kuerig hot chocolate reaffirmation . 
what a fun winter treat ! this is a perfect cup of cocoa in seconds ! we like to put a tablespoon or two of heavy whipping cream in the bottom of mug before brewing ! a family favorite . 
was skeptical about the quality of hot chocolate from a k cup but grove square is amazing it is just as good as making it from scratch but without the fuss the milk chocolate is mild , the dark has enough bite to make it interesting and the peppermint is perfect for after dinner . 
i love these ! the price is very good all the flavors are really good ! the peppermint one is my favorite and i would gladly take more of that before the others though the others are n't lacking at all , i'm just a peppermint fan ! will be buying more when my others get low ! thanks so much ! . 
i like this hot cocoa very much it has a very rich taste compared to the others i have tried just bought some more of these a href http www amazon com gp product b005k4q1vi grove square single serve hot cocoa cups , milk , k cups for keurig brewers , 24 count a a ! ! ! ! cocoa ! . 
i was skeptical about buying this because all of the other hot cocoa items i 've purchased for the keurig have been awful i was pleasantly pleased with this ! it is simply delicious ! i will definitely reorder ! . 
this is a really great k cup cocoa i had been drinking the cafe express but they have really gone up lately so this is a good buy nice creamy chocolate flavor so i switched to this i found it at walmart but this price is better here for the 3 pack give it a try \) . 
for those who do not drink coffee , this is a great compliment to the teas and ciders also available for your keurig . 
super good price and the best k cup cocoa we have found br br i am glad i found this for our family before the big cocoa season hits ! br br love it . 
we have bought several types , brands of hot cocoa k cups these our definitely one of the best ! they have a great flavor and everyone in my house liked them , even my 9 year old who only likes some hot cocoa loved this it is creamy , it actually tasted like a melted candy bar , very good taste , not watered down like some of them of course the price is amazing , but do n't let that fool you ! this is one of those products that is actually good even though it is n't very expensive . 
wow , i did a lot of reading trying to make a good decision on a k cup hot chocolate , and of course taste is something that is very subjective if you read all the reviews on every product you 'll discover that nothing gets past everyone and maintains a perfectly spotless reputation so i decided that even with some bad reviews i 'd try this one since it has a lot of good reviews i'm just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate connoisseurs writing reviews in this thread some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute , or some such thing all i can tell you is i must have under achieving taste buds because all i can taste is yummy hot chocolate my family burned through the first box and i just ordered two more if you do n't like this i feel sorry for you better to have numb taste buds i guess enjoy . 
when i got my keurig brewer last month , i bought two different types of hot chocolate the grove square hot chocolate is far superior i have so far brewed it on 6oz and 8oz with good flavor at both sizes the flavor is rich and it leaves no residue in the bottom of the kcup \( the other brand does , maybe i got a bad batch \? \) overall , i will happily buy this one again . 
i got these cocoa cups based on my sister in law 's recommendation it has a great flavor and is inexpensive quite a good combination i 'll be ordering more very soon . 
this is excellent hot chocolate for those of you that love love hot chocolate go for it you will love it to i would purchase this again . 
i 've tried all the available brands and flavors of hot cocoa for the keurig , and this is the only one i keep buying more of when i run out of course it 's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk , but i find it at least as tasty as any non k cup cocoa mix i 've had it is richer than the same company 's milk chocolate cocoa \( which would , however , be my 2 pick of k cup cocoas \) br br one star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup , there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the k cup , which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum strength cocoa shaking the k cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some . 
i love the flavor and the speed of this cocoa i drink one at night and each is the same good stuff . 
i am very pleased with this selection i have not tried the other hot cocoa brands for keurig but this one is awesome ! i bought the milk chocolate . 
lets face it , 11 is n't going to get you the most succulent chocolate in the world but it does give you a great everyday cocoa in a 6oz brew great to mix with a coffee for an instant mocha , and no sugar needed ! kids will love it very happy with this purchase will keep this in my pantry always ! . 
i have searched for hot chocolate for my keurig , but could n't find any that were economical to purchase i found this at a decent price , and was i glad ! my husband absolutely loves this hot chocolate and says it reminds him of his childhood try it you 'll like it ! . 
my brother owns a keurig one cup coffee maker , which is an amazing device i , however , do n't drink coffee when i came across these hot cocoa k cups , i took a chance they 're incredibly good , and it gives me a chance to share a hot drink with the coffee crowd without having to boil water or milk this 24 pack is priced well against the coffee k cups as well . 
i ordered this because so many people were saying that it was sugar free it 's not the first ingredient is sugar it 's too much of a pain to return , so i 'll keep it and drink it \( because it 's a pretty good k cup hot chocolate \) i will think twice about ordering it again though i 'd really like to get what i ordered . 
best k cup hot cocoa on the market , bar none would not be without it in the house , especially with the winter months coming . 
this is a very mild hot cocoa perfect for those winter evenings or even good in the morning instead of coffee we love it anytime next time i will try the dark chocolate . 
this is very good hot chocolate , creamy and tasty all of the flavors are good , my favorite is the peppermint i wish the peppermint was available on its own , not in the variety pack my son and i also like to add peppermint flavored marshmallows , for an extra shot of peppermint taste in my opinion , better than the swiss miss k cups . 
the hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it , but as far as i could tell , was n't strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients if you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little , but it does n't take away from the taste of the cocoa , so as far as i'm concerned it was n't an issue i would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you 'd get in a coffee machine , which is fine , because i do n't hate coffee machine cocoa i have only tried the peppermint so far , and it tasted like peppermint what can i say \? that 's what it 's supposed to taste like . 
we enjoy a cup of hot chocolate with our keurig machine and used to have cafe escapes as our favorite when i saw the grove square brand at such a great price , i thought i 'd give it a try we love it it is now our favorite brand i will be back for more ! . 
had never heard of this brand before , however the price was right for ordering turns out the family likes this better than the swiss miss k cups we had been using will continue to buy , will continue to use do n't forget to buy the mini marshmallows at the store ! . 
my husband said it tastes wonderful ! ! just like you would get in a restaurant creamy and flavorful ! hightly recommends this product ! . 
this hot chocolate is very good and flavorful compared to other hot chocolate that we have tried it is cheaper and we would recommend . 
this is a great assortment and price i only give it 4 stars because the peppermint is very weak in peppermint , so i add extract nice cocoa flavor to all , tho reminds me of homemade . 
best one in k cups todate not watery like several of the others i have tried will now join the subscribe and save group ! a href http www amazon com gp product b005k4q64k grove square hot cocoa cups variety pack , k cups for keurig brewers , 12 count \( pack of 3 \) a . 
well the product was good and the taste is great the convenience was excellent and the delivery was quick so what 's not to love \? the darn things tend to clog up my machine never ever happens with coffee may one could run hot water after each serving to prevent the clog otherwise an excellent product . 
i'm really baffled by the great differences of opinion on this product i 've tried a couple of different brands and the grove square was without doubt the best i recently purchased a cup of hot cocoa at a local joe muggs \( in a local bam store \) that was over 2 for the smallest size and really could n't tell much difference obviously every person has different tastes and opinions but so many 1 and 5 star ratings for the exact same product \? oh well , i like it br p s 11 27 i like this cocoa well enough that i have subscribed to momthly delivery with free shipping and reduced cost ! . 
the price was as fantastic as the taste so convenient to make and no messy powder that is hard to dissolve no major cleanup to deal with either highly recommended ! . 
the kids like cocoa perfect when you ca n't make the kids hot choco tastes good too 24 count \? not bad . 
grove square hot chocolate is very tasty i was searching for the swiss miss brand and the search pulled up this one the price was right so i ordered some with hopeful expectations and was pleasantly surprised at grove squares wonderful chocolate creamy taste even on the large cup koerig setting you wo n't be disapointed . 
i love a cup of hot choc in the cold winter months we live in penna and it gets quite chilly here the hot coc is a little sweet for my taste , but i 've gotten used to it and enjoy a cup once in a while . 
my daughter says this is the very best hot chocolate she has ever had ! and i love it because no more spilled envelope messes ! . 
i finally found a hot cocoa for the keurig that is n't too sweet i made a cup the day it came in the mail and from the first sip i was hooked from now on this will be the only hot cocoa i drink . 
my grandson and husband love to bond drinking this hot chocolate together i get it every other month i ca n't ever be without it . 
in my trip through the health area of my local food market i stumbled upon enjoy life boom choco boom dark chocolate bar i just ca n't resist trying things such as this into the cart it went it 's rather good it says it 's dairy , nut and soy free , and i 'll take their word the question is taste well , it 's a good tasting bar i have a couple others that i would regard higher but this one is quite good it 's a bit high in calories \( 170 per bar \) but has no cholesterol or sodium not bad i 'll pick it up again br br gary peterson . 
i 've ordered most of the cheaper tea 's etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor and value i cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in a href http www amazon com gp product b004tj3zua takeya airtight drink maker pitcher jug , set of two a and it works wonderfully \( those jugs are great , even better if you can still find them half price at costco \) br br i'm glad i ordered this when i did , the price has more than doubled ! i 'd still say it 's a great value this is my go to tea when i want something with a little more flavor than regular black tea i do n't sweeten my tea , but i think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day the orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others it 's noticeable without being pungent or artificial it also is n't spiced like many other orange teas . 
arrived nicely packaged and sealed an aromatic , lovely tea that i love to blend with others to make custom iced tea blends i love this oolong orange with fruity black teas recommended ! . 
that is right , open the bag and just get your nose close and smell it you know this is a quality product instantly some of the tastiest tea i have had and the oolong and orange are a great mix even if you are n't a tea drinker at all , once you smell this tea you will want to try it i am very glad i bought this product it is a favorite of mine . 
so fun and great price this was one of our party favors at my son 's birthday party huge hit ! i will buy again for the baseball team and group outings the box is just like the good ol' days , although i remember the prizes were better back then \( or maybe my expectations were lower since i was 10 \) . 
we bought 2 cases of these expire date was 3 months out plenty of time to eat we have 2 boys and got these for them as a snack in lunches etc i was worried that the product would be stale as stated in other reviews we 've ate 3 boxes and all were fine so far kids loved it and i did as well prizes were not as good as they used to be but they did n't know the difference a few were educational and that never hurts ! we 'll probably order another couple cases at 40 cents per snack you ca n't go wrong ! . 
bought these to give out as party favors for my son 's baseball themed birthday party they were a huge hit with both the adults and children . 
i threw my son a baseball themed party for his 1st birthday what would baseball be without popcorn , peanuts get crackerjack \? ! item was delivered as promised the packaging was old school , which was appreciated by parents , granparents the even great grandparents ! item was fresh taste great ! . 
i ordered this product for a themed baby shower they went over well and they tasted just like normal cracker jacks loved that i could find the box and they fit perfect in favor bags . 
if you 're looking for a healthier alternative to peanut butter \( whatever reason \) this is a good choice it 's nice and crunchy , tastes better than other brands i 've tried , and does n't separate as much as others best i 've found so far . 
i love these noodles they are really great for a midnight snack it 's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner if you do eat it for dinner , you will be hungry later maybe some people would n't ! ! ! ! but , it just does n't stick to my ribs i love them though and amazon has a really good price . 
this soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy ! i really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up , nice texture it is very satisfying to me i'm a single gal who does n't really cook am often in a hurry for my next meal , and i find that this soup really hits the spot although it does tend to be more of a mid afternoon snack light lunch item for me it will tide you over for a while until your next big meal , but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours br br personally i looove this soup that much more because i had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because i developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks it seems that often these instant noodle packets bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish this one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do another plus for me is that it 's not spicy i'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods , plus i have gerd reflux , so believe me if i can eat it is not spicy just tasty \) br br one thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable \( in my town they only take 1 's and 2 's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of \) oh well , ca n't have it all . 
somehow i feel healtier eating these things instead of peanuts i do n't know why either also , unlike peanuts , i can limit my intake to a handful and not the whole bag . 
i have tried all of these nuts and they are fantastic i highly recommend them as a snack which is not only healthy , but tasty the mulberries combined with chocolate are amazing . 
a suprisingly delightful snack ! great to have around while i'm working long hours in front of the computer . 
a great deal it arrived with no damage the taste to me is the best i have tried most other brands and really got fed up with them they just do n't taste right to me but this one i can eat right out of the bottle and enjoy it it tastes so good i am very happy with this purchase and the price is great also . 
i prefer jerky with a dry texture but always have a hard time finding a good one they 're usually moistened soft chunks of meat instead of hard strips if you like old school jerky then i highly recommend this product delicious ! . 
recommended to me by a friend i saw at the gym had seen them a few times at the fatted calf in napa , but didnt really pay attention i will never buy beans in the bag from the grocery store again huge difference in taste and quality sent my son who is an aspiring chef and gourmet foodie a box of beans in a bag as well . 
i 've probably tried about 15 varieties of beans from rancho gordo they 're all excellent some are better suited for one type dish than another , and if you visit their website , they will tell you what works best for which dish br br some are just plain gorgeous to boot ! and being heirloom , i believe you can also save some back to plant , if you have the climate for growing them \( unfortunately , i do n't \) br br out of all the ones i 've tried , we like the borlotti best they cook up plump and will hold their shape , with a creamy interior they 're fantastic for mexican style beans frijoles borrachos , refried , whatever you like and i 've also cooked them with ham hocks garlic onions etc for a delightful bowl of beans br br this particular assortment does n't have the borlotti beans but you could always add them to your order ! it 's a nice sampler and will get you hooked on their products br br oh yeah , sign up for their newsletter too , steve sends out a good one with recipes and stories of the beans . 
i had no idea what this stuff was when it was served to me at a restaurant recently and i could not stop eating it ! finally figured out it was kalamata olive tapanade , and i wondered where the heck can i get this stuff \? i'm totally spoiled now ! well , i headed for where i always go when i want the best of everything amazon com ! and there it was , and now i can have it whenever i want ! i love tossing a bit with pasta , particularly the tomato and basil pasta i also order from amazon it 's great on salads , on humus sandwiches , and anything else you can think of once you get the taste in your mind hehe it 's fantabulous ! br a href http www amazon com gp product b001hti4tm peloponnese kalamata olive spread , 7 5 ounce \( pack of 6 \) a . 
i got this for a gift for my father and he loved them i will probably get them again but only as a gift due to the cost of sausages . 
i know the description is clear enough about apples cranberries but i found these sausages to be a little too sweet my guests agreed the same company makes sausages that i like better . 
this coffee is really rich , perfect in the morning i ordered it for the office , but it was going fast after a day or so i decided it was too good fine to share so i swapped it out w some cheap stuff and brought it home more for me ! . 
this canned organic corn is great sweet and plump , and being organic is added bonus inside , the can lining looks just like eden 's bpa free cans , but so far i ca n't find the consumer service number of the company to verify if their can is bpa free at least i do n't see the white plastic lining in these cans i'm just hoping these are bpa free , then these are totally awesome ! . 
found this item quite good it was sweet and slightly crunchy all in all , a delightful product it arrived in excellent condition , no dents and no dings perhaps the packaging has improved . 
very good corn product , we will be eating this case of corn way faster than we expected it was well packed and stores in the pantry nicely . 
i combine this with libby 's organic black beans and libby 's organic green beans mixed with bob 's red mill organic brown rice at least two or three times per week for a perfect meal every time ! . 
we live in an area that does not have a lot of stores that carry organic at reasonable prices that said i found the product to be a good value and convenient not to have to sometimes wait for local stores to restock , if they even stocked br br yes , some cans get dented in transit but it really was not a big problem for me i hope the future delivery is the same or better br br it is unknown if the can lining is bpa free i try to avoid it but until the manufactures get it out it 's near impossible to buy canned goods that do n't have bpa in the can lining pregnant women should avoid anything with bpa in it and if i had growing children i would also strive to avoid . 
i ordered from east coast supplier before and even when shipped with a bag of frozen water the dark chocolate coating turned very light i live on the west coast and this seller is in ca , so i got the snickers in just a couple of days , instead of 10 br and their shipping costs were less , they shipped via post for under 5 , instead of via ups br lowest price i have paid for this candy and best quality . 
these tic tacs are great right up there with the orange flavor i did find them cheaper at the 99cent store 49cents a pack i went recently and bought 24 for 12 heads up for anyone living in ca . 
i first encountered this flavor at an airport magazine stand i sampled a couple and was hooked i thought this flavor was the best of all in the tictac line on my flight , i was munching on the pack absent mindedly i landed with the idea of buying several packs then came the rude surprise grapefruit flavor is not a common sight on tictac stands anywhere br br i finally settled on this purchase as the only way to maintain a steady supply this flavor of tictac is best used as a chaser , following a heavy duty breath freshening from tictac power mint , the blue color not only is power mint effective , it also numbs out my tongue for several minutes a follow up with a single grapefruit restores my mouth to normality br br i rate grapefruit as the best flavor , with watermelon and the new strawberry foelds close seconds in general any flavor tictac is effective breath freshening , but grapefruit is truly addicting tictac settles the issue that the tongue is a major contributor to sour breath . 
delicious and unique flavor , great for those who like a little tart taste nice the have a 12 pack since they are pretty hard to find . 
when i stumbled across pink grapefruit tic tacs , i was intrigued enough to order them i do enjoy grapefruit flavors and i love tic tacs with intense flavors these did not disappoint they offer an intense flavor that tastes just like real grapefruit br br an unusual treat ! . 
look no futher always fresh ! nothing is worse than stale candy , , so save yourself from anguish and purchase here today . 
my daughter and i loved these when they first came out but had been unable to find them locally then i thought , if anyone would have them , amazon would ! br br so glad to find them it made a nice addition to her christmas stocking . 
we found these pink grapefruit tic tacs while vacationing in massachusettes when we returned to california , we could n't find them ! i was happy to find them here they taste great ! . 
this is a keeper flavor hope tic tac removes pink grapefruit from the limited edition category citrus flavor seems especially potent to freshen your mouth after eating onion garlic . 
i rarely eat anything but whole wheat pasta , but every once in a while , i eat some of this as a treat almost as good as the pastas that i ate while in italy ! just make sure you do n't over cook . 
i love the meadow so i guess this review is more about how much i adore this store , than it is about the salt \( which by the way is fabulous \) i got my order way faster than i expected , which was nice i would recommend purchasing anything from these amazing folks , and even better if you can visit their lovely store in portland this is one of the most romantic stores that exists opening my box of truffle salt , and smelling that fragrant scent , was just not as magical as walking into their gorgeous store filled with flowers , salt , chocolate and wine ah , it is a taste of heaven br br the salt 's great thanks meadow people . 
a very soft , very delicious keebler brand cookie that is hard to find in the supermarket and generally around 4 49 bag 'cause it 's never on sale i picked up my order of 6 bags through warehouse deals fulfilled by amazon for 13 00 , a good bargain considering how much they are in a grocery store 4 49 bag and hard to find usually in this variety ! if the sale is right , i highly recommend it for you to try and buy for yourself ! . 
it is hard to stay out of these wonderful cookies ! just the right amount of chocolate chips and the texture is melt in your mouth good ! . 
i may be dating myself here a bit but i remember when the first soft batch cookies came out these were the first and they were bigger and yes , even softer than these are now but , at that time , they were the only soft , prepackaged cookie \( can you believe that \? \) besides archway they then came out with at least a dozen other varieties but for some reason , they stopped making them i can remember every kid imaginable going nuts over these things so i'm wondering why they stopped br br anyway , back to today , these cookies , even though they 're smaller , are still quite excellent they are just so soft and taste better than keebler 's other soft and chewy cookies this package made it about 20 minutes in this house that 's what happens when you 're raising a bunch of titan boys ! br br great , great stuff , highly recommend ! . 
chewy chips ahoy and keebler soft batch are very similar taste and texture i decided to try this since a had a coupon for 50 off they 're slightly smaller than chips ahoy , but that 's about it my cookies arrived a little crumbled due to shipping , but no complaints because they were still edible and tasted great great cookies , and now i have a stockpile of them \) . 
needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store as stated in another review , the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box this seemed a bit odd , but there were 2 sheets of wax paper , i guess to prevent dust , etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom not much else to say , they 're jelly belly 's at about half the cost of the local guy ! . 
i do n't understand why this dog food is not full of reviews checkout 8230 they give this dog food 4 out of 5 stars which beats science diet and purina one which i use to use and diamond natural is less expensive . 
we purchase this food for our two boxers and great dane the dane has an allergy to chicken and one of the boxers has a weak stomach , so this food is perfect for them all three dogs love it \( even the picky one \) and it seems to agree with their digestive tracts more than any other dog food that we 've tried \( i ca n't begin to tell you how pleased i am about that \) i did a lot of research to find a quality food that is n't full of filler and wo n't break the bank i am 100 pleased with this food , more so than any of the other more expensive brands that i 've tried . 
i have tried many many many different brands i also did my research on what 's the best for my dane and most of it is expensive i found this to be very good quality and a good price among chicken soup and canidae br my gd loves this he eats 7 8 cups a day and he would love to eat more he has a shiny coat , no allergies and his sensitive stomach thanks the food i highly recommend this but i am buying it somewhere else a little cheaper and 2 day shipping \) . 
over 90 of dry dog food is very unhealthy and can not even get 1 or 2 stars out of 5 or 6 diamond naturals is a great food i have 6 afghans and i 've spent many , many hours of research to find this out . 
my giant schnauzer was weaned on this food when we changed to blue buffalo , eukanauba lamb and rice , and nutro he developers allergies this is the only food that works . 
it 's amazing how little popularity that diamond pet foods seems to have considering the quality ingredients their foods contain ! i worked at a pet store for about four years our number one recommendations on foods were natural balance and wellness two exceptional foods that are pretty expensive but for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large breed dog , those brands can cripple your budget so when i would get customers who absolutely loved their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks , i recommended diamond diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like purina and iams , but contains only natural , healthy ingredients just remember , the less garbage you feed your dog \( by products , fillers \) the less your dog uses the bathroom and they stay fuller , longer ! . 
this is the best dog food i have ever purchased , and having been a dog training for over 4 years , i 've purchased a lot ! we first tried this food when our new addition \( an 8 week old german shepherd \) joined the family , and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food with any purebred dog , health can be an issue , and you do n't want to fill your dog with by products and plant fillers from day one this food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers , and i do n't understand why there is n't more publicity for this product our other dog , a 5 year old english bulldog with constant skin allergy issues , was switched over when we discovered this brand , and she has not had an allergic reaction since ! we did n't realize how much it had to do with diet her hair used to fall out in spring \( not just normal shedding , but actual balding from hair loss \) , but this has alleviated that problem as well now our shepherd is a year and a half old , and he 's eating this large breed adult lamb rice flavor he 's not a big eater , but he loves this food ! will definitely keep him , and all future pets , on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now ! ! kudos diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food br br side note i would never buy regular diamond brand food if the bag does n't say natural on it , the standards they are kept to are way lower and the quality suffers immensely stick with natural \( it 's a couple dollars more at most ! \) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life ! is n't that what we all want \? ! \? . 
i do n't review much , but i have been buying this brand for my irish wolfhound for over 2 years now he still loves it and it 's good for him if you have a large breed dog , this dog food will be a good choice for healthy food . 
this food gets an a rating compared to failing scores for many others in the price range however , it 's about 8 more here on amazon than at the local pet store \( after a 9 25 sales tax \) . 
my 8 year old great dane was itching a lot with the lamb meal from the big box stores i started buying this \( for cheaper \) and he stopped itching his coat is also looking shinier i wish i would have discovered this years ago it saves me trips to the pet store and money also . 
i ordered two of these bags for my three dogs a mastiff , a lab , and a terrier mutt they arrived well packaged inside cardboard boxes the dogs like the food , their coats are shiny , and the mastiff did n't vomit when beginning this new food he has problems when switching foods , but he started on the diamond naturals with no problems i'm going to continue to buy this food for my dogs . 
i have 3 dogs with different needs and tastes and this is one of the few foods that meets them and basically one of the only ones i can afford br my oldest \( 14 \) loves the lamb , my husky loves the glucosamine and the youngest farts less on this food which makes everyone happy br i always try to find food with good ingredients and this meets that standard while staying one of the cheapest foods i thoroughly recommend it ! . 
this salad seasoning is so simple but extremely tasty it enhances the salad as it 's not too over powering it 's a salty , mildly seasoned packet of goodness it 's also very addictive probably due to the msg add olive oil and red wine vinegar , mmmmmm i ca n't believe i found it here , b c you cannot find it in mainstream supermarkets nor ethnic markets anymore . 
i have used this product for a few years now , my family and i love how it adds flavor to our salads and frozen vegetable dishes problem was i could only get it at a few grocery stores when i would go home to florida to visit , then i could n't find it at those stores anymore i was happy to find it on amazon and ordered the case quantity which will last a long time . 
i loooove this product i use it a lot on my salads , vegetables and to season meats delicious ! ! ! . 
i love goya salad and vegetable seasoning , i tried it once and was hooked , it 's the only thing i use on my salads now i love the small packages , i can easily take them to a restaurant i also love the fact that it is much lower in calories than regular salad dressing thankfully , the area that i live in carried this product for a short time and i was able to try it unfortunately the area that i live in stopped carrying the product , i know this because i searched every store in the town that i live in as well as the surrounding towns eventually , i went to amazon and found the product , unfortunately at that time they are out of stock , i waited six months and finally amazon had the product again i ended up buying the pack of 24 eight count boxes , to make sure that i never ran out of the product again since i had so many i was able to share with friends and family . 
this is a simple salad seasoning , just add vinegar and oil one packet of goya br salad seasoning and you will have the best salad ever also you can put in br a potato salad and is marvelous also ! br please give it a try and enjoy it ! ! ! . 
my husband refuses to eat fish , but he loves this it only takes 10 12 minutes to make , and is way better than any other kind of tuna helper i 've tried br br besides the box itself , you 'll need br br 1 can of tuna \( 6 oz , or i use 8 oz \) br 1 tablespoon of butter br 1 cup of milk br br it 's a breeze to prepare , just don't leave it alone before you put the tuna and pasta in because of the milk , it likes to boil over just keep an eye on it and reduce the heat right after it starts boiling . 
mackerel is a tasty alternative to salmon with nearly the same omega 3 content my local grocery store has n't been able to get tinned mackerel for several months no one can explain why so i ordered a case of these and have been pleased with the quality and value i'm reordering . 
i have ordered mackerel several times on amazon and most pleased with seasons brand than any other seems to me the fish are smaller therefore less mercury br packed in olive oil is also a bonus they are not as fishy as others that i have tried i eat them to get a healthy serving of omega 3 my 11 year old boy has taken a liking for them as well as my 14 year old daughter we put a small chunk on a cracker and top with a ring of hot banana peppers a href http www amazon com gp product b000hdmw9m season fillets of mackerel in olive oil , 4 375 ounce tins \( pack of 12 \) a i would recommend this brand tom heflin . 
i ordered these a while back off of amazon the mild flavor and firm texture is great when they are available here they are about 2 3 's the cost of my local super market they are always good no matter where i buy them i just wish amazon kept them in stock all the time . 
the product was exactly as i expected and the same as previously bought in retail stores . 
at 3 33 a can , these are expensive for what they are , but are well worth it the mackerel are of very high quality , are well packed , and not overcoooked or smoked also , since fish is the only meat i eat , i end up having a can almost every day . 
these are better than the usual canned fish filets , tastier , and not dry there are no bones or skins i worried about mackerel but they are much nicer than , say , kippered herring filets or sardines in oil it 's easy to pour off the olive oil if that is a worry , but you 'd be losing something that is also tasty . 
they taste good and give you a lot for what you pay the meat was of high quality i was however expecting each tin to contain one medium sized fillet rather , these are about 6 small fillet in a can , much more like sardines are packaged \( but these are just fillets \) was a bit disappointing for that , and the info could have been more clear . 
ordered 2 cases on different dates and got them within 2 days cant find these in the stores so please keep them in stock make for a great meal with some veggies or a salad and this type of fish with omega 3 's is good for you . 
these are wonderful ! exactly like the originals , only in miniature form delicious and crispy and the wonderful amaretto flavor ! rapid shipping from the seller as well ! . 
this has been a christmas favorite since my late sister in law introduced our family to these cookies over 20 years ago she was from italy and loved these cookies as do we . 
this product makes a great gift ! not only are the cookies delicious , but the tin is attractive and of good quality highly recommended . 
when i was in rome i got these for my grandfather as a gift , he is from italy so i thought he would enjoy something from home \( although i was n't sure if these were a little americanized , since a lot of the wording on the tin was in english \) anyway , my grandfather loved them my mom thought they were too sweet , but he just loved them and now i am glad i could find them online so i can get him more ! . 
a little more money than your average cookie , but very much worth it you will not find a cookie like this anywhere else ! . 
we had candied chestnuts that came in a box in france many years ago and have since looked for them in the states this year i searched the internet and wa la there were some products to try there were some products more expensive and because the product would be shipped we did not want to be spending a lot for something not that good these came in a can with syrup which was different than the ones we had had in france but they are excellent . 
the best way to get jelly belly a good price and you only get the flavor you want . 
chocolate with coconut ! how can you lose \? br br i love ross chocolates you can really tell that they are made of top quality chocolate it is creamy and flavorful br br i enjoy these \( and i buy several flavors all have the same great quality and taste \) especially because i try to keep my sugar intake to a minimum i keep a supply of them in my refrigerator in airtight containers at all times they keep very nicely . 
very nice product it is not a mounds bar , but it helps satisfy the urge . 
de is a very good coffee i ordered this as my father in law raved about it , and the whole bean aroma rood is indeed a good coffee it tastes like a medium coffee with a particular spice feel to it very unique and very tasty i tend to make my coffee very bold even if it is a 'medium' coffee , and even bold this is up there with some of my favorite coffees br br if you are a coffee fan , this is worth a shot , pun intended br br enjoy . 
i drank this coffee over 30 years ago when i lived in the netherlands so glad that i can get it through amazon strong , full bodied but easy on the tummy ! ! ! . 
if you have a coffee grinder , this is the best coffee , i would highly recommend it ! the taste and aroma remind me of sitting in a cafe in holland , relaxing and watching the passersby . 
this is a very good , medium roast , medium bodied coffee brew it directly after grinding the bean to capture the most flavor . 
this product came as advertized it was a great buy and i love the taste of the tea br br great deal and happy i purchase from them . 
i used this flour in my usual pizza recipe i noticed the difference with regular bread flour right away the dough was very elastic and easy to work with the pizza ended up being lighter and crispier than usual i will only use his flour from now on ! . 
shipping was prompt and the product was what i fully expected it helped me be successful with mama agata 's lemon cake where u s flours failed . 
i do n't know why this flour is n't available in grocery stores in the midwest typical grocer flours have a protein content much too high to give an authentic taste to such foods as pizza crust and homemade pastas and after years of making homemade pastas and trying to find that perfect recipe that would result in those served in the best italian restaurants in the us and europe , i'm happy to discover , the secret was in the 00 protein content all along what a fabulous difference this flour makes ! freezes well too . 
so this stuff is a must have for making true pizza napoletana i'm really thrilled that it is so accessible here in the usa this flour makes the most silky smooth dough i 've ever had the pleasure of getting sticky with , and it has a different \( better for pizza \) taste than the all purpose store brand flour sure it costs a little more , it 's coming from italy , but given that you can make about 6 pizzas per bag who 's counting \? get this stuff , some d o p tomatoes , grow some basil , and make some mozarella \( okay , i admit , have n't done this one yet \) but given the first couple items there and you 're well on your way to the origins of pizza in naples , italy is it worth it \? \? \? i say si ! ! ! mangia ! ! ! \( and taylor 's market always comes through for my home shipments ! cheers ! \) . 
i ordered this italian flour after reading an article about some of the issues with american wheat it is br light , and everything i 've made with it from cookies to pizza crust has been delicious it was shipped br very quickly . 
if you follow their recipes precisely , with careful measurements , the freezer jams are excellent strawberry jam is particularly appealing i 've been warned that changing quantities of any ingredient will not have happy results . 
sweet , juicy and yummy i have to try hard not to eat too much at one time so addictive it tastes just like those in asian market actually this one tastes a bit better . 
dried mangoes are my hubby 's favorite fruit he especially loves the philippine brand some come close , but no cigar we have searched high low to find a brand comparative to these , but there are none having them delivered on a regular basis is great with free shipping no more detective work and disappointment he does have to be careful however , because he seems to eat them too fast runs out short of the next delivery , maybe i will increase my quantity ! quality is the best delivery on a regular basis was a perfect gift for him i am very happy satisfied . 
great value and much superior to what you find in stores makes a great snack or after dinner treat , but for those who are health conscious remember to keep it to a few pieces since they are covered in thin sugar try to keep the bag tightly sealed once you open them since the slowly begin to dry up will be ordering more soon \) . 
by faar the best dried mangoes i have purchased fresh and full of flavor the 2 pach 20oz is probably the best value order a lot because it will be done before you know it trust me it is heartbreaking when you reach into the bag and only find mango crumbs . 
i remember really loving to eat dried mangos when i was younger so i decided to give this brand a try these were n't bad per se but they were a little too sweet for my taste i guess it 's a good thing though since you do n't want to eat a lot of them because the calories will build up unless you control your portions i 'll eat one and it 'd satisfy my sweet tooth for hours before i want to eat another one therefore , i guess it 's a good thing that it 's a little too sweet but still i would have liked less sugar . 
tasty , slightly different flavors then other brands , but good in all other respects good purchase hard to find in us so i am not too picky . 
this sauce is excellent for authentic chinese dishes ! my wife is from china and we love to use this product to make hot pot and ma po tofu . 
bought this as a joke to give to a friend that is a beer connisseur \( sp \) for his dog the dog did n't really care one way or the other and tried to give some to my dog and he also turned up his nose not sure , but it appears to have a very salty , brothy smell that could be the reason for the turned up doggy noses however , it was cute to put into staged pictures of the dogs with the plastic bottles looking like they were hung over , along with their master ! . 
i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and his roomates' dogs it looked really cute in the package but left the dogs exremely gassy they are a german shepard , pitbull and a retreiver at fairly large sizes but it was a little rough on the tummy so use lightly . 
i use this for iced tea and it is just so much better than american teas it just plain is ! it is all i buy , and now i get it for others too look no further . 
i'm a big black tea drinker and have tried a lot of different brands out there , and i find that pg makes the best black tea it 's nice and strong , not like crappy lipton black tea we 've been loyal to the pg brand black tea for over a year now it 's a little pricier than other brands , but definitely worth it if you enjoy black tea . 
i find it is difficult to find black tea in the united states that is of decent quality i love pg tips it brews up nice and rich and is reasonably priced . 
i really love this tea and have found that my daughter and daughter in law feel the same ! i 've used the loose leaf tea for years but find the convenience of the bags encouraging . 
love this tea especially love triangle bags more flavor the tea is what i remember it to be happy br came right on time in great shape happily enjoying my pg tips ! a href http www amazon com gp product b001eq5jle pg tips black tea , pyramid tea bags , 240 count boxes \( pack of 2 \) a . 
love pg tips tea it 's hard to find in the usa , but a standard in the uk . 
i baked my first batch of these muffins and was pleased that they were so easy to make and tasted so good then i stored them in the refrigerator since gluten free home baked goods are notorious for molding i ate one straight out of the frig and it was great ! i guess the flavors melded together after being stored a few hours i finished the batch one at a time out of the frig without re heating any of them they were so good that way i could n't bring myself to try them any other way \) br br our family has been navigating the area of gluten free eating for over 10 years the choices just keep getting better as more companies are becoming aware of celiac disease i have created an astore through amazon that has the gluten free items we have had the pleasure of trying . 
if people would read the ingredients they would be less critical of the end product i only tried them as pancakes and they lent themselves most excellently i used an erythritol instead of sugar and they tated great and cooked very well i did not even use a blender to mix . 
i could n't get these to work for muffins , so i decided to try the pancakes and was n't disappointed they come out perfectly raised every time i like to make these without any sugar in the batter the flax makes it very bitter , but i like them like that with lots of butter however , if you just add some syrup on top , it extinguishes the bitter taste on contact give these a try ! . 
these muffins will not win any prizes for flavor i agree with other reviewers that the aftertaste is somewhat bitter and compared to \( at least what i remember of \) real muffins with sugar , gluten , eggs , butter , and that other good stuff they are quite fine br br i do not eat gluten , derivatives of sugar cane , eggs , soy , dairy , corn i could go on but you get the idea in order to use this mix i had to make substitutions and was delighted with what tastes like a treat to me aside from the fact that i do n't have to measure out three kinds of flour to make something from scratch , the best thing about these muffins is the texture texture is a challenge absent gluten , sugar , and eggs , and i found this to be very much like how i remember muffins the bits of dried apple make these chewy and kind of weirdly so br br overall , i am pleased with my purchase . 
i have 2 children with food allergies , so i have to use egg , milk and butter substitutions for these muffins , and it works well i add a little more sugar to the mix and top the muffins with a brown sugar and pecan mixture before i bake them all my kids love them ! you can top with just brown sugar if you cannot have or do not like pecans i love these muffins as well ! . 
folks who are comparing this to hodgson 's blueberry muffin mix obviously do n't require gluten free products \( since the blueberry are whole wheat muffins \) if , like me , you require gluten free , this is a great product this is the first flavorful gf baked good i have stumbled upon very simple and quick to make like all gf products , they are pretty dense in the end , but the apples make for a nice addition and they fill you up personally , i added a bit more sugar \( xylitol \) than the recipe calls for next batch , i will also add some fresh apples and extra cinnamon my only complaint is that you get so little out of the box \( makes 6 small muffins \) . 
these muffins were very good made according to the recipe on the box , but when i changed the recipe a little , by substituting almond milk for the 2 milk , and extra virgin olive oil for the butter , they were great ! next time , i am going to try adding some grated carrots and not adding the sugar thank you hodgson mill for a wonderful gluten free product . 
my family really liked these muffins i also made them while on vacation at my sister 's house , and her family loved them i just got back from a bible study full of pretty picky eaters , and they all said they were good they 're usually pretty honest about how the gluten free food i take tastes , even telling me once that some store bought cookies i took tasted like cardboard br br i did notice a very slight bitter aftertaste , but it was not too bad i think next time i make these i may take the advice of one other reviewer and add a grated apple for that extra touch oh , and i only added 3 tbs of sugar and think they were really good , as did everyone else who ate them i'm sure that if you add even more sugar , the slight aftertaste could disappear altogether br br i just went to the hodgson mills website and saw that they did recently change the formulation to this mix , so maybe that improved the aftertaste this mix does not have garbanzo flour they use sorghum instead , now i did not make these as muffins i found that one box is perfect for 2 mini loaves , which i prefer to muffins very good i will continue to make these when i need something fast and do n't have time to make it from scratch br br oh , and to the poster who asked about gluten free pasta , tinkyada makes a great brown rice pasta . 
i recently discovered that i have sensitivities to dairy and wheat , so i have been trying gluten free products i knew about hodgson mill because of their oat bran hot cereal , which is really good and soothes my tummy consequently , i ordered hodgson mill gluten free pancake and waffle mix , as well as their apple cinnamon muffin mix both have proven delicious even my husband , who is not gluten sensitive , loves the pancakes i made waffles from the apple cinnamon mix this morning , and they were really good and very filling not sure if the formulation has changed since the previous negative reviews , but i have no complaints , and i am very picky i just wish hodgson mill products were more readily available in our local stores if anyone has tried their gluten free pasta , please post because lundberg 's rice pasta left a lot to be desired br br thanks ! . 
woeber 's hot spicy mustard is oh so good ! i 'll buy another case when this gone makes a great gift as well ! . 
it is great ! i like it alot great price too i think it is delicious top quality product in my opinion . 
this is a nice mustard for sandwiches , potato salad , corned beef , roast beef or hot dogs i have yet to find a single woeber product that i do not like they are all tasty i am glad to see that their distribution range has grown over the past ten years . 
i started giving these to my daughter when she was 9 months she loved them so much her first word was cracker \( while signing more \) ! they dissolve in her mouth so i do n't have to worry about choking and they are healthy too i highly recommend it . 
we have to hide these boxes and pull them out when our one year old daughter wo n't eat anything else she will always eat these her brother and sister are always sneaking and eating them too . 
my little girl will ask for these crackers day and night bought a pkg of 6 and have used up 4 real quick i will be back for more very soon . 
i love these graham sticks they dissolve well and are super yummy \( yes , i have eaten quite a few of them \) i think they taste better than any other graham cracker i 've tried , and they 're organic to boot as far as sugary snacks go , they have pretty healthy ingredients i like pretty much everything i 've tried from earth 's best for those of you interested in how they 're sweetened they contain organic invert syrup , organic evaporated can juice , and organic honey they do n't have anything scary in them like maltodextrin or other such sweeteners just vitamins and natural , organic products . 
and they are good for them ! with whole wheat flower and no high fructose corn syrup like a lot of other crackers . 
my 1 year old loves these ! great snack ! i 've tried to find these at my stores and ca n't seem to get them very often love that they are organic and my one year old loves that elmo is on the box ! . 
i love these snacks because they are whole grain and organic i also love the fact that they do not spill everywhere out of the snack cup like cheerios i have also noticed that they do not leave a lot of crumbs , which makes mommy happy . 
i bought these for my grandbabies because they are earths best and organic they like them , but not as well as the cinnamon ones i tried them , thought they tasted kind of like dirt . 
bought these for my grandbabies and they love them i love them because they are organic only the best for my little guys my big guys even snack on them . 
15 month old loves to eat them on the go ! they seem great for a healthy , quick , and easy snack ! . 
my daughter loves these snacks and so does everyone else i try to feed my daughter organic stuff and i'm so glad that earth 's best makes a variety of snacks that she can have . 
this is a very good snack that i feel great about offering my 10 month old she can easily pick up the small pieces and definitely enjoys the apple cinnamon taste my 5 year old loves them as well ! i would definitely recommend these to anyone with small \( or larger \) kids \) . 
these are the only organic grahams i can find for a reasonable price we love these and amazon makes them a perfect affordable snack for my toddlers . 
these are great crackers my little guy likes them a lot and best of all , they do n't contain any soy or dairy ! . 
i have a pure breed gsd and had problems for years with upset stomach , eating grass and throwing up bile in the morning and then would not eat as her stomach was too upset it finally dawned on me that due to throwing up bile in the am was that the food was not staying with her i even tried feeding her before going to bed at night and still did not work i tried evo and i could not believe the change she does not get us up at night to go outside she was having 3 4 bowel movements every day and now she has 1 or sometimes 2 i have had her on the evo large bites for almost a year now and she has not been sick once it is the higher protein in this food that stays with her longer and has made all of our lives so much better thank you , thank you evo ! ! ! . 
we have a golden retriever and had been feeding him the wellness dog food he ate it begrudgingly so we decided to find something else i read the ingredients on the evo red meat and was really impressed i gawked at the price but decided cheaper dog food is n't really a bargain if your dog wo n't eat it or get any enjoyment out of it the first time we fed it to him he pretty much inhaled it and will literally go sit by the bag and look at it like it might just open if he stares at it hard enough ! i agree with the first reviewer that loose stools are a factor but believe with time that will clear up he is just so happy that we will keep on buying it for him , although i wish the price were a little more reasonable . 
i have been feeding my gsd the red meat formula for about 6 months and all i can say is wow before i started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price ! you feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about 2 weeks his skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too the only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stools but it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted all in all if you can afford to feed them evo its well worth the investment ! . 
when i got my dog i did a lot of research regarding dog food and dog food ingredients there are high quality dog foods like this one out there , but you probably wo n't find them in regular supermarkets while this food may be more expensive than other dog foods , it is well worth it innova evo is one of the foods that were not affected by the recall also , the ingredients are healthier , and do n't have high wheat grain content or nasty additives br br my doberman used to have a lot of dandruff and had some skin problems also her poop was really mushy , almost diarrhea when i finally switched her to innova evo red meat i 'd wished i 'd done it sooner she does n't need to eat quite as much , and her coat is beautiful ! no more dandruff problems and her skin is great . 
we have two great danes and it is very hard for us to keep the weight on them br br evo is the first dog food that both of them enjoys i dearly enjoy not having to chase them down and make sure that they eat br br i have also notice that our older dane is more active since he has been eating evo we feed them a mixture of the innova evo red meat and innova evo large bite dry dog food . 
i have a 2 1 2 year old 60 pound german wirehair pointer we feed this food during hunting season due to his increased metabolic needs he burns so many calories , he eats 8 cups of this food a day \( with zeal \) we use the large bites to help keep the tarter and plaque off of his teeth \( and to slow his eating \) due to the high quality of this food , he can keep up his energy , keep his weight up , and recover more quickly from scrapes bumps from running the field our vet 's exact words were , your dog is an example of perfect health you may think the price on this food is high , but it is worth it you get what you pay for also , consider the canned version of this food it is a nice way to feed hydrate a dog after a long day hunting just give them an hour to settle down first on a side note , we feed diamond naturals beef and rice in the off season we have no digestive issues transitioning from one to the other \( we switch over a period of a few weeks \) . 
complete , protein based nutrition my dogs love this although i'm not sure the pibble actually tastes it , she inhales it so fast \) br br regarding the other users who have had diarrhea issues my gastro picky gsd \( is that a word \? i think other gsd owners will understand ! \) has had this as well initially , i overfed this food , thinking that he needed to be eating the same amount as he had been eating the other stuff br you feed much less of this product it is nutrient dense , and not all filler like other foods if you over feed , you increase the risk of unpleasant side effects br br it 's a bit pricey , and i have n't broken down the cost per day , but since you feed less it might be competitive with other brands if someone was inclined to run the numbers . 
my wife switched our dogs to this food about 4 months ago and she has virtually gone from vacuuming daily to once a week the dogs hardly shed at all anymore no more brushing needed and their coats are very soft and shiny we have used other grain free foods previously and liked them but this one is definitely the best we have tried it 's pricey but we are able to feed them 1 2 of what we were using on the other foods and still maintain the same weight this food is well worth the price and the dogs love it . 
this was a new food for my dog , and he seems to have adjusted very well to this product thank you , and i wish there were more coupons available for this item . 
my husband and i are not coffee drinkers , but we love hot chocolate we hated the time it took to heat up the water , and the mess the dry mix sometimes makes we saw that the keurig coffee maker did other things like hot chocolate and tea , liked that it was almost instant hot water , and bought one i ordered another brand of hot chocolate k cup , and absolutely hated it it had a weird almost metallic taste that was not sweet or chocolately i was worried i wasted my money on a maker i would never use i decided to try another brand and purchased the cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa , and we absolutely love it ! it is sweet and chocolately without being too bitter \( which is why i originally steered away from the dark chocolate \) i fully recommend this product ! ! . 
even my kids like this they are always asking for hot cocoa its not too sweet and very chocolaty it is not super high in sugar or calories so its a great little treat enjoy ! . 
good tasting and the pricing is pretty good it 's always sold out on keurig com , so i come here to make this purchase , i love dark chocolate ! reason for 4 stars , the pricing is n't great but it 's okay . 
this is a wonderful dark chocolate flavor much deeper flavor than the milk chocolate the milk chocolate is good but does not have this deep flavor will be buying this again ! ! ! . 
the hot chocolate k cups do n't work like the coffe k cups the coffee k cups have a screen inside the cup to keep the coffee grounds in the k cup , it also makes the last drop of liquid to fall into your cup as much coffee as the first drip these cafe escape hot cocoa k cups do n't have a screen the chocolate powder empties out of the k cup as fast as it can , so that the last amount of water to come out of the keurig is mostly water and it sits on the top of your cup so stir it before drinking it , otherwise all you taste is the sweetener also these k cups are made for 8 oz serving size , so use the appropriate cup size for your taste . 
this seems to be the best brand that i have tried others have been very weak in flavor , but not htis one i would truly recommend this for moms who have small children and need the hot chocolate after playing in the snow grab the marshmellows and enjoy ! grammie smith \( 6 grandkids \) . 
this is a much better hot chocolate than some of the reviews would have you believe my wife does not drink coffee \( calls it yuck \) and i am very particular about my coffee , but we agree that this is an absolutely delightful hot chocolate i use a medium cup size setting and it seems to be the best one for this brew this chocolate comes in as a not so close second to some of the great hot chocolates we have had while traveling europe , however this did save us airfare but this is not at all bad for an instant cup of pleasure adding marshmallows or topping with whipped cream would take it over the top br br if you are one of the ones who wants to throw yours away , please send my way i will get rid of them for you thanks ! \) br br i got this product directly from keurig as one of my two free when i registered my new brewer and purchased two could not beat that price here , but at normal prices , this is the deal br br from the package 60 calories , 2g fat , 11g carbohydrate , 1g fiber , 7 g sugar , 1g protein ingredients sugar , alkalized cocoa powder , creamer \( and all of those ingredients , etc . 
these bites are 'just enough' for a snack they are delicious and the price is very reasonable ! i will definitely purchase from this company again . 
i tried this brand first and i must admit i became spoiled because subsequently i went to whole foods to try and buy a bunch more i had to get navitas and found they were smaller , drier and less flavorful so here i am this brand 's golden berries are large , with a wonderful more succulent texture the only problem is sometimes i get the seeds stuck in my teeth ! they have tiny white seeds like raspberries but the berry itself resembles a large golden raisin the flavor is very strong and captivating like a lemon with the tartness strength of a cranberry within days of incorporating golden berries into my diet i have noticed my insides are thanking me golden berries are naturally very anti inflammatory they have an addicting flavor that i will gladly continue to feed into . 
imagine if you made a craisin out of a berry that tasted like a lemon instead of cranberry these are very tart , which i love i eat whole lemons so tart is fine by me these are not super sweet either , which is refreshing . 
both my boys have autism and are on strict gfcf diets the foods by ener g are very good these cookies , although rather crumbly , are delicious ! br br my youngest son calls them 'white cookies' i am a very picky eater but do enjoy eating a white cookie with him ! you should try them with some chocolate melted on them oooh divine \) . 
these cookies are delicious my grandaughter ate a whole package the first time she tried them she has several food allergies and finding a delicious sweet treat is almost impossible i will be reordering soon because she has gone through the whole box already and has requested more i am so thankful to have found this product . 
slightly crumbly , but overall a very good cookie in my opinion very similar to chips ahoy but more airy , less dense . 
like a lot of gluten free foods there is a tendancy to crumble , but these arrived in very good condition the vanilla flavoring stands out very good for light snacking or dessert . 
son is gluten free , but not fun and tasty free , so these are great ! ! ! i put br his icecream on these for a cool snack taste good to him too just plain . 
my husband eats gf , and i do n't , and its so hard to find him goodies , and hes always tempted to eat mine now he has some thing i'm tempted to eat , i thought they were ok cold but if heated up they really taste yummy . 
i am addicted to these cookies they taste much better than the regular ones the only draw back is , that they should be available in smaller packages to avoid binge eating . 
i read the nine reviews that preceded me and wondered how a product depending on a person 's taste could consistently receive five stars is something suspicious here \? br br nope ! here 's the tenth five star rating in a row , and i'm tough this is the best sauce of its kind \( or any kind \) i 've ever had and i'm an old guy who 's been around just the right sweetness , just the right hotness i 'd love to soak a chicken in it , as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets br br these big bottles wo n't last and i 'll be back for more , fer shure absolutely more than worth worth the little price , this stuff should be standard in every home , along with plumbing br br and my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you . 
this stuff is good my mom gave me a bottle to go with some eggrolls and we were hooked upon first dip the perfect blend between sweet and spicy , this stuff is so yummy that even people who claim to dislike spicy or asian or any other kind of exotic fare find it delicious ! . 
this goes down in my self proclaimed condiment queen nation as a keeper i saw it in the asian market i go to for 2 50 , a huge bottle , i looked at the ingredients , no preservatives or added colors , good , good , said it went with everything , also good , got it home and wow , its amazing ! garlic , hot , sweet , i am a dippin fool now . 
and i do n't mean just for asian sauces this is easily the best sauce ever ! i put it on everything it 's gotten out of hand i go out of my way to see what else i can have it with my latest thing is pouring some over peanuts and coating the peanuts with the sauce then i eat the nuts with a spoon to keep my hands clean sounds gross but it 's so delicious . 
i use this in my banquet kitchen for so many dishes it is a perfect blend of sweet and a pinch of heat if you toss chicken wings in it , you will have some great bar food in your own home ! another idea combine sweet chili sauce , heavy mayonnaise , granulated garlic , finely chopped parsely , ginger powder , and splash of siracha this will give you a delicious sweet chili aoli perfect for burgers , sandwiches , egrolls , potstickers , fries , fish , or even chicken like i said it is good by itself , but serves as a great base for other things \( from salad dressing to marinade \) buy this sauce in bulk as you will find youself using it on everything ! . 
i love this sauce sweet but hot too i use it on checken wings instead of buffalo sauce and with pan seared scallops , shrimp it 's very versitile and delicious ! . 
this sauce is good , but for my tastes it is n't hot enough i have had other brands tht have a sleeper heat that makes the sauce multi layered this sauce seems to ahve one layer . 
once in a while you just want a spicy different flavor sometimes when i have a lightly seasoned or plain piece of beef or chicken , i put some sweet chili sauce on my rice wow that perks up the whole plate other times i cook the meat without seasoning and add what every flavor i'm in the mood for when i reheat it i 've kept open bottles in my refrigerator for months without any problem br br if you have never tried this , the sauce is thicker than heinz ketchup so you can slowly add sweetness and heat until its just right for you another way to use this is on steamed vegetables and you can add peanuts or sliced almonds just before serving . 
the sauce was just fine however , i ca n't resist flagging a particular piece of idiocy , in the hope that someone might be able to convince amazon next time the sauce comes in a pack of 2 , but one bottle was broken yep , you guessed it , amazon sent me a new pack of two , and asked me to return the unbroken original it 's only cost me a little time , but how much it 's going to cost amazon to ship and process that returned bottle , your guess is as good as mine is it really beyond the bounds of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle \? . 
a really great sauce but is slightly more expensive than in other stores it is great for egg rolls or a dipping sauce for many chinese foods ! it is also a great sauce to make chili thai sushi roll . 
i 've been using this sauce for over 9 years now it 's amazing i use it on everything from spring rolls to salads . 
i made crab rangoon and used this sauce as a dipping sauce it was great i love the fact that it does n't have msg in it it has the right amount of sweetness it is a little spicy , but just the right amount . 
i use this in and on meats , fish , poultry , vegies , all purpose dip et al it 's cheap and very very special i gave big bottles to family friends at xmas years ago and they are all hooked you wo n't be sorry you brought this sauce into your kitchen . 
here 's a tiny consolation easy thai barbecued chicken ! cut your usual fryer in quarters , cook it slowly over charcoal or quickly in a hot oven , and then brush it generously with sweet chili sauce and cook it just a few minutes more most authentic with 'sticky' rice but also delicious with brown or red rice br br in thailand , people squat over hibachi sized braziers on the sidewalks and sell portion of this sort of barbecued chicken sometimes they trot alongside inter city buses as they pull into stations , and sell chicken through the windows do n't be squeamish ! this is a treat you 'll remember the same sauce will enhance the flavor of any fowl from blackbird to condor or whooping crane . 
this sauce is very good on anything you cook or grill or you can use it as a dip for veggies etc it has just enough heat to make everything taste better . 
this is one of my favorite sauces to have handy with this order you get two giant bottles which should last a while the taste of this is perfect ! not for the faint of heart however . 
my whole family loves this sauce i use it primarily to recreate a dish we had in maui it adds a wonderful sweet and spicy flavor to just about any sauce service on this order was spectacular several bottles arrived broken and replacements were received within days amazon service was fast , easy and reliable i love amazon also , there are many recipes that you can look up using this sauce that a very good it goes spectaculary with coconut milk , vegetables , chicken or shrimp and pasta we love it . 
i purchased this sauce as it is the exact same sauce used at the hot sauce bar of tijuana flats \( http www tijuanaflats com \) it goes amazing with steak tostadas but in my home cooking , it works wells as a marinade and as a condiment . 
i was introduced to this sauce by a good friend of mine from cambodia , who runs a thai restaurant and bar i wondered what sauce was used in their ramikens when they served their delicious crispy spring rolls their actual sauce was handmade , but i was directed to try this brand since then , \( about 5 yrs ago \) my mother , friends , and i have all used this sauce on fried chicken wings , grilled and sauteed chicken , pork , spring egg rolls , and even sushi ! i keep the large 25 oz bottle in my fridge year round , and this is the best brand i 've used thus far not too hot for those not accustomed to very spicy foods , but is mostly sweet try it , you wo n't be disappointed ! ! o \) . 
as mentioned give this a try ! instant party food , frozen meatballs and this sauce great on chicken , you name it anything party snack happy hour food that you put sauce on would work with this br br however the prices from some of the vendors obscene 19 for 2 25oz bottles \? \? this stuff is 1 50 1 75 for the 10oz bottle at any asian grocery . 
what i like most about this product is its unique taste just enough spiciness and sweetness to make it different but it goes with virtually anything i have n't tried cooking with it but i can imagine it would add a lot to stews , soups , etc it keeps well the last bottle i had got lost in my pantry and was several years old when i found it and it still tasted great it belongs along with the a1 , heinz 57 , worcestershire sauce , catsup , etc as a condiment staple . 
i had brought this as a dipping sauce for dumplings and egg rolls i made at home it taste 's great and i think it the same sauce i get at some thai places cause it tastes the exact same . 
this is delicious it makes a gourmet cook out of a novice put it on chicken , pork , steak it is ca c'est bon i wish i could say it in chinese we love it we purchase it on amazon prime saves a trip to the market makes a wonderful hostess gift . 
the best sauce on the market we use it on almost any food product but it is especially good on veggies . 
we cook a lot of chinese dishes in our household and this sweet chili sauce is a must have ! one of our favorites is sesame chicken , but we could n't seem to get the flavor just right that is , until we added this yum ! ! . 
i love asian flavor w o the extreme heat i had this sauce w some wings at mellow mushroom in knoxville , tn i immediately asked the bartender if he could find out the brand of the sauce for me because it was perfect amazing flavor ! ! ! . 
this is the best sweet chili sauce i have found anywhere some say its to sweet but hey , it 's a sweet chili sauce and its supposed to be sweet it has a rich full flavor that everyone in my family likes even my wife who ca n't stand anything anyone would consider hot just loves this sauce i'm a pepper head myself if you 're like me and like a little more kick try adding some sriracha hot chili sauce to this and you will learn to love it too . 
this is without doubt the finest sweet chilli sic sauce in the world i use it with hot or cold dishes , including chicken , venison or roast beasts it is superb seasoning for a plain rice , quinoa , bulghour or cous cous sweet , hot and authentic i buy 2 of the larger bottles at a time , refrigerate the open one and save the back up as insurance could not run my varied menus without this great red elixir ! . 
there where plenty of times we had to eat out but then came mae ploy sweet chili sauce now we can eat in whih the same flavor , exciting taste as being at one of the favorite restaurants ! ! ! . 
this sauce is something of a permanent staple on our table ! ! just about everything gets a dash or two , or three ! . 
not truly spicy my 2 year old loves this stuff ! br great on chicken , even chicken nuggets , for spring rolls the crispy ones and even fries br it 's sweet and spicy all in one so very good . 
i go to my mothers home one day she cooked fried chicken and rice i taste the chicken , it is good ! that was the day i was introduced to mae ploy sweet chili sauce this sauce is excellent being sweet and mild hot , will not burn your mouth or give heart burn i will continue to purchase this product chicken , fish , and other foods are more tasteful try it because it is good ! . 
i use this stuff on pretty much everything turkey sandwiches , homemade sushi , scrambled eggs , chicken nuggets , and more so perfect not too spicy , not too sour not too expensive either love it . 
i first tasted this sauce when i was visiting in alaska it was served with fish tacos , and was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy i could n't find it locally , so i ordered it from amazon it 's available for a reasonable price , and is wonderful with fish , pork and chicken i have n't tried it on beef , but not sure if it would be good or not it 's also terrific on vegetables i highly recommend this product ! . 
sooo good , i followed some advice and thought outside of the conventional box sliced up some cabbage and onion and sprinkled some mae ploy chili sauce on it with some lime juice too , made a nice salad with a kick ! also very good with cilantro and daikon . 
if you have ever wondered what that delicious dipping sauce for the crab wontons are at pei wei , or the amazing sauce on chang 's chicken is , this is it ! br br i love this stuff i discovered it while at a pei wei someone had left a bottle of this laying out and i quick snapped a picture , took it to amazon and found it it is great on pretty much everything , as previous users say i was also in a thai restaurant the other night and they used the same sauce on an amazing salad try this on a do it yourself salad consisting of sliced mangos , lettuce , onions , and red peppers drench those ingredients in this stuff and everyone will think your a master chef . 
this is the best ! br years ago , i used it loved it ! moved could not find it again i have purchased many hot sweet sauces over the years , trying to find this flavor recently , i found it again at world market now i'm addicted ! everyone has mentioned great ways to use it br my favorite i use it on my salads , along with a little fat free dressing now , i eat tasty salads every day , \( without the cheese ! \) br br sodium is 200 mg per tablespoon and the amount of added flavor is worth every mg ! . 
this is a great multi use sauce great for using as a baste when grilling fish , chicken , shrimp , pork , etc . 
this sauce is an excellent blend of sweet and spicy i love it with eggrolls , rice , just about anything that needs an extra kick give it a try ! . 
mae ploy sweet chili sauce is the best i use it instead of duck sauce check it out once you try it , you 'll be hooked . 
kids love the sauce on many things great on rice , chicken , spicy sweet br br highly recommend . 
tried this sauce first at our favorite place to eat out was very happy to be able to order some for our home cooking ! great ! spicy hot and sweet ! . 
i love this stuff i put it over chicken and even steaks it 's very sweet , and just a bit spicy just a little goes a long way . 
i did not purchase this product off of amazon i purchased the 12 oz bottle at a local store , and i must say it 's one of the most addicting sauces i have ever had ! i'm a pretty picky eater , and a vegetarian at that , so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one this sauce is almost perfect it 's very sweet , and has a strong garlic taste at first it is n't as thick as the red hot brand , which i did n't like much at all \( thick , not as flavorful , way too chunky \) this sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not my son loves spicy food just like his mommy another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons , and that much sauce goes a long way 1 gram of fiber , too ! the only thing i have a hard time with , and this is just a personal issue , is the texture of the red chilli they tastes great , but they have a very thin , clear skin that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces not all , just some i get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy still , i eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces i have ever tasted ! i would recommend anyone to try this sauce first , and then try others if you are not fully satisfied this sauce is amazing it was about 1 50 at the store for 12 oz but if you like the easiness of ordering online or ca n't find it near you , know that i would pay amazon 's price for it any day ! buy this sauce i do n't care where or how , just buy it you 'll fall in love ! . 
mae ploy sweet chili sauce is becoming a standard condiment on my dinner table it has just the right blend of sweet and heat mae ploy enhances the taste of all meat and fish foods catsup is almost a condiment of the past salsa and mae ploy are the answers ! . 
i have been using this curry paste for several years now , and it makes a great dish although it does n't beat eating indian out , its the best paste i have used for at home dishes even though this is a hot paste , i would consider it mild . 
patak 's sauces have many uses but i always make a basic chicken curry a friend from india taught this recipe to me , and now i always have a jar or two on hand if you want you can get one of the indian pickles relishes as a garnish this is easy but is a bit time consuming with all the dicing and sauteing typically the recipe as written takes an hour or so from start to finish , and serves 3 4 adults i always make at least a double batch it 's just as easy and that way i have leftovers to freeze and everyone can have plenty to eat you can use any rice , but basmati is so fragrant that it is what i prefer some indian groceries have frozen naan you can heat in the oven for an even more satisfying dinner br br ingredients br 1 1 lbs chicken breast cut into 1 2 cubes br 1 cup nonfat plain yogurt br salt br 3 tbs patak 's curry paste , flavor heat depending on your taste br br 1 \( generous \) tsp cumin seed br 1 \( generous \) tsp mustard seed br 1 small onion diced br 3 cloves garlic diced br 2 medium potatoes , diced same size as chicken cubes br 2 3 carrots , diced same size as chicken cubes br 1 14 oz can diced tomatoes with juice br cup frozen peas br 2 3 tbsp cooking oil br salt to taste br br 1 add chicken yogurt , curry paste and about tsp salt to a bowl mix thoroughly and let marinate while you prepare vegetables br 2 heat oil in large frying pan over medium heat until hot br 3 add cumin seeds and mustard seeds , stir they are ready when mustard seeds start to pop do not let them burn br 4 add onion and garlic saute until soft stir constantly or else it will burn br 5 add carrots and potatoes saute until potatoes are just about ready to eat you have to stir very frequently or they will stick burn i do not let anything caramelize br 6 add chicken yogurt mixture saute a few minutes until chicken is about half cooked through lower heat to low br 7 add tomatoes and let simmer until the juices cook down a bit , and chicken is cooked through br 8 add peas for color add salt to taste br 9 serve over freshly cooked basmati rice remember to soak the basmati rice prior to cooking or it will be hard . 
patak 's makes the best curry around i frequently use it in my yellow chicken curry dish which is a favorite with both my husband and seven year old . 
i first drank this tea at naniboujou lodge on the north shore of minnesota , and bought a small packet up there i was hooked , so after i had drunk the first bit i bought i wanted to get more of this tea asap was glad to see it for sale in such a high quantity here i used to be a coffee drinker , but i much prefer tea specifically , ashbys afternoon tea now , and i just gave away a bag of coffee i 'll never drink i never quite got why british people are so into tea , but whether this is a typical british tea or not , i do n't know i now see why they 'd build their afternoons around a high quality tea like this one sublime . 
the gevalia breakfast blend is perhaps the best coffee i have ever purchased it is full bodied , without being bitter it also is much cheaper to purchase through amazon with free shipping for prime members cant' beat it . 
i 've tried the other gevalia flavors and this is the only one i like \( french vanilla stinks \) its like your regular cup of coffee that goes with any flavred creamer . 
have drunk this as my standard brew for years however , tastes change , and i'm beginning to sense that it 's a little on the light side for my maturing tastes nothing wrong with it it 's better than most restaurant coffees by a wide margin . 
i was surprised to learn that amazon sells gevalia coffee , which led me to search amazon for other household items at great prices i wish all shopping could be this easy br br update 12 24 11 how can the price go from 15 00 to over 47 00 yikes i guess no more gevalia for me if that price is correct \? . 
stocking stuffer gift for family love this brand blend full bodied , not too dark , not too weak just right this has become a family favorite that everyone looks forward to receiving . 
everything that is stated in the information is exactly what i had recieved thank you . 
i purchased this coffee for my grandfather , an old vet and lifelong coffee drinker he thoroughly enjoyed it and we were able to share many stories over a nice pot of gevalia i would definitely recommend this brand , especially this blend , to anyone that loves a good brew cheers ! . 
several gevalia brand coffee 's have been among my favorites for years velvet noir , signature blend , traditional roast , etc the breakfast blend is my go to every day grind it 's got a perfect blend of bold rich taste , terrific aroma , and full taste , with very low acidity and harshness just incredible coffee ! . 
i tried this coffee two years ago and found it much better then other brands of coffee i had had before since then i have been buying gevalia coffee at amazon amazon offers a good price , even lower than that on the gevalia online store . 
the breakfast blend has always been one of my personal favorites from gevalia gives whole new reason to getting up early on saturday plus , the amazon price could not be beat ! . 
i love geliva coffee its not bitter like some of the brands and it set well on my stomach i have too say its the best coffee i every had and i tried a lot of expensive brands as well as the lesser expensive this is mid price and i love it i will continue to buy this frm amazon every three months . 
gevalia kaffee is by far the best coffee on the market br especially the coastarican peaberry and the peruvian organic . 
gevalia is the best coffee there is always mellow , never bitter i 'd never drink any other brand . 
i received a box of this for christmas it is really good not overly strong like most black licorice it is indeed soft and it has a very simple ingredient list with no high fructose corn syrup like most candy br molasses br wheat flour br licorice extract br natural flavor \( aniseed oil \) . 
this is the best licorice ever ! or at least the best i 've ever had or can conceive of the only problem is that now that my 12 pack is gone , it 's hard to concentrate on my work as i go through panda withdrawal and cannot think of anything but panda . 
this is real licorice it is soft , has great taste , and is very healthy ! love it . 
i have been eating panda licorice for a number of years and it is hard for someone who loves licorice to eat any other brand this is all natural \( which is what makes it taste great \) from the licorice root fresh always because of the unique packaging and the most flavorful . 
these chews are tasty and chewy the price is excellent for what you get we have plenty around for ourselves and to share with family great treat for little kids br plus they are good for you with no added junk just licorice br great buy , great taste . 
this is what black licorice should taste like ! no artificial off flavor no nasty artificial black dye to coat your tongue and teeth wonderfully soft and chewy i took a box into work and everyone agreed that it was the best black licorice that they had ever tasted . 
my daughter and i were looking for some real licorice and after reading several reviews about different brands of licorice we ordered the panda licorice we are very happy with panda and will order again soon . 
this is the best licorice in the usa if you have a craving for something sweet , this is it and so good for you i love it and the price is very reasonable i will continue to order this product it is always fresh . 
this black licorice has great flavor and texture some are too soft and too sweet for me personal preference i'm sure , but i like this because it 's slightly firm \( not hard but not soft \) and the sweetness is just right love that it 's only 4 ingredients molasses , wheat flour , licorice extract and aniseed oil price is good too compares to tire tread licorice which is my first choice but i ca n't find it . 
just received these boxes rather than buying the bar type that i did before excellent ! they are small bite size pieces that are soft and flavorful really fresh i did the subscribe and save and am happy that i did my husband and i really enjoy this brand the boxes are larger than i realized , but i still will carry this item in my purse for a pick me up and to have a handy snack available with me the boxes have a open and close tab with a plastic seal over the product once you open the box i ca n't find one bad thing to say no dissapointments at all . 
i , myself , do not care for licorice but my husband thinks this is the best licorice he has ever had and he loves the stuff i have also given it to two friends who are licorice lovers and they say it is delicious . 
panda all natural soft licorice is a great snack for family movie time br we consume it like it was water it 's the best snack next to popcorn . 
this all natural licorice is very good i highly recommend it i bought this as i a read natural licorice is good for an upset stomach . 
this is by far my favorite black licorice and the list of ingred could not possibly be shorter or better ! now if i could learn how to not eat the whole box in one sitting . 
if you deal with diabetes or hypoglycemia , please use real licorice products with care i ate some of this yesterdy \( it was delicious ! \) and had to skip both my dinner insukin shots i also woke in the night with a reading of 66 too low for comfort ! so , if you have insulin resistance , please be aware that true licorice candies or extract may have an affect on your body btw , i am buying more today to use medically \( i just wo n't eat so much in one day \) what a lovely way to get out of getting shots ! \) . 
quality and delicious licorice ! and this is the best price oz i could find for quality licorice anywhere highly recommended , if you 're into buying 30 worth of candy \( you can subscribe for the lower price and then unsubscribe no problem \) . 
love it eating it has got to be a ritual taste is well balanced , nice and chewy without being overly sticky , leave a great lingering aftertaste br br compared to gimbal 's scottish dogs , these taste and feel more traditional , and much healthier too , given that only four ingredients go into them br br out in the midwest , ann abor to be specific , i found these in the candy aisle for around 2 80 per resealable bag of 170g . 
i got the licorice at a cheese shop in new york and by the time i got home it was all gone so got on the computer and found and bought some that 's how much i liked it i have not done the before and do not regret buying it yummmmmm . 
if you liked licorice as a child , this is a dream come true it is soft , and the taste rolls off the back of your tongue but you ca n't eat just one \( box \) . 
i love this licorice and as someone with a lot of food allergies , i appreciate that it only has four ingredients . 
the panda black licorice is an excellent product the raspberry flavor tastes mostly like molasses this is fine if you value an all natural product , but it is not what i expected the two flavors that i bought have all been consumed so they tasted good . 
some licorice products leave the teeth with a black film but not so with the panda soft licorice chews it is a delicious licorice product that improves with age , in my opinion the candy from a freshly opened box is very soft and tends to stick in the teeth more than candy from a box which has been opened and closed for several days because it hardens as air circulates around the candy if i place it in an airtight container , it remains soft , but i really love it as the texture changes the flavor is consistently delicious and it is now my licorice of choice i was expecting the box to contain a plastic bag but it simply has a plastic seal along the top of the box with nothing inside to seal therefore , if you want your licorice to remain fresh , i 'd recommend placing it in an airtight container i 've also purchased the raspberry flavor but have n't tried that yet i have a hard time considering fruit flavored candies as licorice , but enjoy the confection also . 
i 've always liked licorice candy and the best licorice i 've ever had was obtained at ikea it was from sweden yum ! in any case , i 've mentioned this around and then a box of panda soft licorice appeared in my christmas stocking br br the panda licorice is good real good excellent flavor nice and chewy good aftertaste i 'd rank it with the best i 've had it 's imported from finland and is made from all natural ingredients in my opinion , it does n't quite make it up to the licorice i obtain at ikea , but it 's close br br gary peterson . 
this is by far my favorite licorice to the point i have a case delivered on a regular monthly basis an option offered by amazon a very convenient service . 
this product comes from finland and is an all natural product that is always fresh and i have never tasted better licorice in my life this product arrived fast in a protective box and the price is great i will purchase another case now . 
nothing but good feedback from everyone a very good classic tasting licorice product we buy it on subscription and save shipping and a little money . 
i first saw this product , panda licorice , at the memphis , tn zoo at the panda exhibit i thought it was just a promotion for the zoo i bought some it was the really good old fashion black licorice i used to get when i was a kid not the chalky no taste stuff most is today while at the norway part of epcot at disney fl this year i found the same thing then i realized it is a company brand name made in finland not a zoo promotion i bought some more it cost 5 per 7 oz box when i got home i checked several websites and amazon was the cheapest pack of 12 boxes total cost shipped to me \( there was a free shipping deal \) came to 2 50 per 7 oz box it is totally delicious when this is gone i will surly order more . 
i love these licorice get licorice flavor not just sugar with some flavor very satisfying . 
i sent the panda licorice to my brother in law who really knows his licorice he usually buys it by mail specially from one company his comment was delicious . 
this licorice is great it taste like the old fashion rope licorice i will continue to buy it . 
i have been enjoying this product for some time i buy it at wegmans grocery store , i believe the cost is under 4 00 a box if you like black licorice you will love this product . 
panda licorice is great it is always received fresh and is much better tasting than the red vines or twizzler brands i highly recommend a standing order \( approximately every 3 months \) which reduces the overall price per box br amazon is a very reliable and communicative mail order company aloha ! . 
for those of you who like love black licorice , i seriously recommend this product i eat it because i love black licorice , and only recently found that what i have observed is now reported by nuitionists as well these is evidence that black licorice is an aid to those with constipation it comes in other flavors too , but the medicinal effects only come the black . 
i am a fan of black licorice panda black licorice is simply the best black licorice that i have ever eaten ! well done panda ! . 
not the best i 've ever had , but good the best i 've had was expensive and from an english company \( i ca n't remember the name \) but this is better than the movie kind they 're not quite as moist and rich as the best ones i 've tried . 
wimpy coffee drinkers beware , this is not the bean for you br if you like strong , bold flavor , you have found it in larry 's what a great coffee , br starbucks move over , larry is in first place ! ! . 
i'm not much of a candy eater but these suckers are fantastic sweet and long lasting my whole family is addicted to this great treat . 
the first can that i got of this wonderful oil was packed in a poor way an old , reused box with not enough padding when i complained the company was quick to respond with an apology and a new can packed well for the mail i was impressed with their responsiveness the merula oil itself was excellent a great treat . 
my review is of the strawberry melon flavor only i did not try the other flavors in the variety pack as i puchased mine individually br br i do n't usually drink these types of beverages , nor do i drink much soda i generally dislike overly sweet , artificial ingredient laden stuff quite by chance i tried a strawberry melon fuze slenderize beverage and really liked it br br what i liked most was the pleasing flavor and the absence of sugar , although it does have sucralose as a sweetener \( rather than aspartame \) it was not overly sweetened and the blend of strawberry and melon flavor was for me perfectly balanced i could clearly distinguish both flavors fuze was really tasty , no strong aftertaste and no sugar heaviness in the mouth it was honestly the first time i 've had this type of beverage other than a snapple tea beverage that i would purchase again br br i'm a little skeptical of the benefits of the micro nutrients that are added to this beverage l carnitine , super citrimax and chromium perhaps it 's a bit more marketing hype rather than beneficial nonetheless , i found this beverage to be refreshing , tasty and something i would buy again br br it is a little bit pricey though compared to a 12 pack of store brand diet soda , which in my neck of the woods ia around 2 99 or a little over 02 ounce , fuze beverage is priced 24 99 for 15 18 5 ounce bottles , or a little over 09 ounce that makes it more than 4 times as expensive as the store brand diet sodas br br in spite of the price , i would buy this again and would justify the price by considering this more of a treat rather than a water substitute br br 5 stars . 
i do n't drink a lot of sugary drinks and soft drinks i try to watch sugar intake and dislike overly sweet drinks by chance , i tried one of the slenderize drinks and was amazed the drink is truly lightly sweet , using natural fruit juices , acesulfame potassium , and sucralose as sweeteners would definitely recommend to anyone who would like a soft drink replacement that still is n't as sweet as a typical diet drink . 
i have been looking for a nice strong rose tea , and this is the one ! i 've tried a number of brands , but they were n't rosy enough for me this is an excellent tea with a strong rose flavor no bitterness nice and smooth i highly recommend this tea ! . 
the aroma is amazing , like a walk in my rose garden , minus the bees but add a little honey in the tea and there you are beautiful taste is smooth , full , delicious . 
i visited a winery vineyard in tuscany where they sold leonardi balsamico vinegar as well as all the wines the flavor of this balsamic is so difficult to describe but it is smooth ! i was used to grocery store balsamic vinegar and some specialty store balsamic vinegars it 's like comparing skim milk \( yuk \) to cream which would you rather put in your gourmet dishes \? . 
there are two types of larger suckers sold on amazon , i got the tropical ones this time just as good as the regular kind these ones have a mixture of sour and sweeter parts well worth the money . 
these mega lollies are the best i eat 10 a day so they go quickly , i'm not going to tell you how many ive bought since jan 1 this year they are great i love them . 
i am addicted to this candy will try not to order another batch for awhile ! ! ! this is my candy to eat on the ride home from work in traffic to keep me calm . 
the parisian cafe blend is wonderful but it is too thick to fit correctly in the senseo machine the box advertises universal fit but it is not . 
coffee has a great flavor and is not too acidic fits perfectly in out juan valdez pod maker that was purchased at target several years ago ! so hard to find these so was glad to find them on amazon ! . 
smooth coffee , but a bit to big for senseo , interestingly all the other melitta one pod flavors fit just fine in senseo , my fav are french kisses and vanilla haze . 
we love melitta coffee pods makes a perfect cup of coffee every time the coffee is always delicious , even the decaf blend ! if you have a coffee pod machine , try all of their blends they 're great ! . 
i love coffee and at night really miss out if i do n't have the decaff . 
this decaf pod has wonderful flavor it is much better than their previous decaf skip the buzz i'm glad they upgraded their product . 
i had bought a black and decker one cup coffee maker that used these pods it did n't work properly , but i have managed to use the pods with my old , stand by coffee maker and am please with the flavor and convenience someone had commented about a problem with some of the pods being sealed in the outer packaging i have not encountered that problem overall , i am pleased with this purchase . 
my mom has the hamilton beach single cup coffee maker and was using senseo pods in it they were too strong bitter for her and i was searching for something else found these and wolfgang puck 's and decided to get both for her these melitta breakfast blend pods are her favorite ! she says they have a smooth taste and great flavor granted , neither of us would ever be mistaken for a coffee judge by anyone \( i do n't even drink coffee so my opinion means nothing \) , but she really likes these and is happy to have them . 
this was delicious coffee for a great price which i could not find at any store in my area or areas nearby . 
enjoying my java pods very much easy and fast medium strong to wake me up i get positive comments on the convenience of making coffee . 
melitta pods are an inexpensive alternative to k cups that also save in the amount of material you have to throw away buyer beware pods vary greatly in the amount of coffee they have in them these allow for a good size cup of coffee . 
i 've been using these for a couple of years now i highly recommend these if you only need 1 cup of coffee . 
this is one of the best decaf coffee 's i have ever had i was ordering this product from another website but found that amazon 's subscribe and safe plan is the most economical great product . 
though london fruit and herb company 's blueberry bliss tea is one of the best teas i have ever had i cannot understand why amazon has not begun shipping it out to customers who ordered this item months ago ! it is now available through other vendors \( i e wendell tea company in ma \) but not at the amazon price if is 's available to them it should be available to amazon or they should take it off their inventory as an offering a href http www amazon com gp product b004a85g52 london fruit herb company blueberry bliss tea , 20 count \( pack of 6 \) a . 
i love peppermint , but find hard candy just too strong these melt in your mouth and are n't overwhelming and do n't leave an aftertaste . 
we bought this to use with recipes for our tagine this is an amazing spice and at an excellent price ! will buy from again . 
ras el hanout is a versatile moroccan spice blend that can be used for marinading meats \( with a little oil and vinegar , maybe some crushed garlic \) , making stews , or just mixed with olive oil \( and maybe a little crushed garlic \) for dipping bread you can find many recipes that use it with a google term like ras el hanout lamb recipe note that it is sometimes spelled ras el hanoud , so you can find even more using that br br i first found this at the famous \( and expensive \) spice market in istanbul this blend from angelina 's is nearly as good note that there is no one recipe for this spice blend , and there are many private recipes with a good deal of variation . 
i love the taste of this ras el hanout in my rice cooker for brown rice and quinoa it makes the meal so much more special large size too that will last awhile . 
this is a nice , complex spice blend that makes moroccan food , but it can also very easily be used to give body to a quick i do n't know what to fix for supper kind of dish it 's a great emergency item to have in the cupboard ! . 
this spice can be tricky to get good quality and this one arrived quick and the flavors are spot on , use it to marinate fish or chicken then grill it , love it ! . 
not sure it should be legal we put this and a few other spices i wo n't share here on some lamb chops and just fried them they were amazing this spice tastes pretty hot by itself , which makes it a bit hard to figure out how a blend with it and other spices is going to turn out the end result , strangely , was not hot at all since i like spicy , i would usually have been disappointed , but this was so good , i did not even care seriously you have to try this i ordered two other spices at the same time , neither of which will be getting a good review . 
cannot consider ourselves experts on north african or middle eastern cuisine , or having enough experience with ras el hanout to say the aroma and taste is better than competitors but the product was extremely fresh and of exquisite smell and taste so am very pleased with the purchase will buy more when the time comes . 
i love these noodles they are really great for a midnight snack it 's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner if you do eat it for dinner , you will be hungry later maybe some people would n't ! ! ! ! but , it just does n't stick to my ribs i love them though and amazon has a really good price . 
this soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy ! i really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up , nice texture it is very satisfying to me i'm a single gal who does n't really cook am often in a hurry for my next meal , and i find that this soup really hits the spot although it does tend to be more of a mid afternoon snack light lunch item for me it will tide you over for a while until your next big meal , but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours br br personally i looove this soup that much more because i had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because i developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks it seems that often these instant noodle packets bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish this one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do another plus for me is that it 's not spicy i'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods , plus i have gerd reflux , so believe me if i can eat it is not spicy just tasty \) br br one thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable \( in my town they only take 1 's and 2 's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of \) oh well , ca n't have it all . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b000gevgxa goccia black truffle oil from italy a br i highly recommend this product , for the price , the qaulity is exceptional it brings on a strong 'sense of euphoria' . 
this black truffle oil from italy is fabulous it 's strong and subtle at the same time it 's the best deal for exceptional flavor . 
i 've never had sunchy malta before \( i drank a lot of goya when it was available locally \) tastes similar to goya , though with less of a sour taste and slightly less carbonation br br i ordered 50 bottles in order to get free shipping said bottles arrived in 4 large boxes , with each bottle individually packed none broke at the time of purchase , this was the best deal going for malta either locally or in stores \( i 've never paid less than fifty cents anywhere \) br br now , though , the free shipping is gone unless sunchy seriously expects me to drop 7 50 for shipping per bottle , it 's unlikely i 'll be buying anymore they should consider selling by the pack or case if they wish to pursue the online business model br br so , 5 stars for value and the quality of packing , with the caveat that i wo n't be buying any more until sunchy figures out how to sell it . 
after reading that corn \( and of course pop corn \) was heavily sprayed with pesticides and agriculture uses lots of chemicals in the soil to grow it , i decided enough was enough it was time to spend a little more and get organic supplier shipped quickly eden foods puts out a great product \( edenfoods com \) certified organic and pops up nicely i use a brown lunch bag \( top folded down \) with 2 tb of corn and 45 sec in the microwave \( your microwave time may vary \) voila ! perfection add some splenda cinnamon cocoa powder mixture and yum yum \( mixture sticks really well if you spray popcorn with a little cooking spray \) only 80 calories for 2 tb ! no worries ! . 
it is very good popcorn but i used a hotair machine so may not have been as yummy as if the oily stuff had been used although i did pour oil on afterwards why would i do that with an airpopper you ask \? because the airpopper was a gift i really ca n't tell a whole lot of difference in the taste from orville r and this , but what i have read is this is organic and much better for you but the price is well pricey no i do n't intend to buy again for that reason , but should my conscience tweek me towards healthier choice popcorn again then i may change my mind . 
this really is the only choice when it comes to soy and dairy free baking \( unless you want to use lard \) the spectrum shortening uses palm kernel oil and has the consistancy of regular crisco \( perhaps a little stiffer \) it seems to bake just fine and if you need to be soy and dairy free i highly recommend it . 
we have used this for all types of baking , including cakes , biscuits , and cookies it works great and is every bit as good as crisco buy organic ! . 
this makes the best tortillas that is about all i use this for , so it lasts me awhile br mine cost about 1 2 the price as listed here , but it was on sale where i bought it too . 
the 500 mile chai is just wonderful the right balance of mellowness and spiciness i 've tried some chai 's that are a bit too spicy , but this one is very well balanced great with almond milk and bonus points for it being organic \( in as much as one can trust the organic label \) br br compare to peet 's chai , i like the 500 mile better , as imo peet 's is a little too much on the spicy side \( although i do still like peet 's and some may prefer that flavor profile \) . 
a fabulous variety of hot sauces with a range of flavors and heat i bought it for a gift for my brother so i ended up sampling , using them myself truly flavorful ! and hot ! i use it in my omelets burritos nachos beans . 
i bought this gift pack and really enjoyed it the hottest hot sauce in the pack is so darn hot it had me burning for about 30 minutes and washing my mouth out with water for 10 other than that one , all the others were really good the wooden case does n't hold the bottles well but the sauces were good i would buy it again . 
this is a cool kit for gifts , or a great price on a kit of dave 's sauce if you use it at home a good variety my only issue is that the bottles do not hold in the wood gift box very well at all , they slide up and down until they fall out of the open spaces in the front or back of the wooden gift box i would buy again . 
gave these as a gift to my brother we are both fans of hot sauces so i thought i 'd give this a try the wooden packaging looked nice and was sturdy enough that it could be used for storage transport of the sauces br my brother says that he liked the sauces , he would not share with me on chirstmas day so i never got a chance to try them . 
this was a great selection of hot sauces , with a good variety of flavor each of the different bottles had a unique taste and each of them had a heat around the same as tabasco sauce oh , except for the dave 's insanity that will have you pleading for the sweet release of death br br but the other sauces are very tasty , and very usable in everyday cooking recommended . 
for the guy who love to saucethings up , here 's the perfect gift and he will love the wooden crate packaging ! great idea and perfect gift \) . 
my son loved all the sauces the only sauce that was way too hot was the insanity sauce , use a teensy tiny bit when using . 
i have been searching for hot sauces and peppers to compliment my cuisine and i finally found it for those of you that do n't like everything as hot as the insanity sauce , their are others that are less intense in the grouping for anyone wanting to use these sauces , read the instructions on the bottles good job dave ! ! ! . 
excellent customer service , quick ship , very well packed merchandise my new supplier of all things hot ! . 
since i 've had the insanity sauce before , i decided to buy my dad this six pack for his birthday br br i tried all sauces but unfortunately i have to say that none of the other 5 sauces even come close to the heat of the insanity sauce , which is the main reason why i buy any hot sauce in the first place , to feel the heat ! ! br br for any heat lovers out there , if you were looking to buy this six pack , i recommend that you buy six insanity sauce bottles instead , you will be much happier if you do ! ! ! . 
since the factory burned down that made firecracker brand pickled sausage i have had to get by with the individually packaged version which does n't remotely taste like the kind i grew up with , not to mention they are half the size these are the best pickled sausages i 've had since my last jar of firecrackers a couple years ago i saw the crappy review and i had to show my support as a person who grew up on these things i definitely know what i'm talking about if you want burn your mouth out hot then look elsewhere but if you want the best tasting pickled sausage on the market currently look no further ! . 
i have been searching for an acceptable alternative to the penrose sausages for years and have eaten many mediocre and gross sausages this is the best penrose substitute that i have found . 
everyone who has tried this that i know absolutely loves it there is n't a lot of heat , but for me that is fine the flavor is spot on and reminds me of the old fire crackers \( before they changed the recipe to dry sticks of meat probably made of orphan kids \) i 'll definitely will be buying this again only downfall is the stupid shipping costs . 
these eggs are soo good i think im addicted they are so yummy and i cant eat just one i was very satisfied with this product and it was shipped to me so quick said it would take a week only took 3 days ! ! ! im very pleased and will always buy my goodies from this seller . 
these are the best beer sausages i , ve come across in decades ! they taste just like the old time sausages i used to get in bars when i was younger if you wont take my word for it just ask 3 of my friends ! ! . 
was exactly what i was looking for super fast shipping ! a bit on the spicy side , but great taste ! ! ! ! br would definately purchase them again ! . 
these sausages have become difficult to find locally i was hesitant to purchase these online as they are in glass and are very heavy but when there is no other option so i ordered 3 jars and they arrived quickly and were extremely well packed not everyone has a taste for the sausages so reviewing that is pointless but the company is great to do business with \( and they do sell other foods \) . 
this is good stuff , and hard to find in the local pet stores here in ne pa one store carries it at times but runs out and at times i send for it through amazon com the price in the stores can be very expensive , and the price through amazon is up in the air as the price fluctuates in the store and the shipping at amazon adds to the price i wo n't discuss price except to say if your dog likes it and is not allergic to it then you have to pay what it cost my dog has lots of allergies and is not allergic to this so i pay what i pay . 
i was nervous after reading some of the reviews about the taste of this and or quality , but after having been consuming this for a couple days , i really do enjoy it ! initially i thought it would be gross , but it really was n't ! it is nice with the fruit in it , and has a kind of nutty taste great shipping , great quality , amazing nprice , and i def rec ! . 
zen brews up to an golden amber liquor the aroma is sweet spearmint the blending of this tea is excellent spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor , then you taste a hint of lemon the green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste br br remember that this tea does have caffeine however , it does not say how much on the box a good estimate might be 30 mg compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter four minutes is ample . 
wow , i have to admit these are really yummy i do n't know how they did it , but they do n't have that imitation sugar taste at all they 're small little bars \( slightly bigger than the normal hershey 's miniatures \) , but for only 30 calories a piece , they are a perfect afternoon treat when you need something sweet at the office . 
this candy is amazing ! great tasting chocolate and caramel and still sugar free i wish it was for sale locally , but am happy i get a chance to purchase online . 
hershey sugar free caramel filled chocolates are very good diabetic friendly chocolate candies these are fairly small , but are very tasty br br sweetened with splenda , these do not significantly impact my blood sugar levels or cause gastric distress br br highly recommended ! br br cfh . 
if you cannot eat regular chocolate , these are just wonderful yummy for diabetics and people who are choosing not to eat sugar \( plus fewer calories \) these are very tasty . 
these chocolates are a welcome find they taste the same as regular chocolate but they do n't spike my blood sugar i treat myself to a couple at a time when i have a sweet tooth it 's great to be able to satisfy my craving without the extra sugar and fortunately the maltitol does n't seem to bother my digestive system br br they 're a little pricey but i found a great bulk deal at another online source . 
it was shipped in a very nice package and i have no complain with the seller my plant growing bigger and now i am looking for a bigger pot to transplant it 's good if you are looking for a a workspace plant that needs minimal maintenance this is the plant you might need . 
cool ! i got it last weekend i was suprised about the pot size , which was a lot bigger than the regular 4 pots about the plant , there is nothing to complain within a week , there are already new leaves ! . 
awesome ! i was looking for this particular plant and homedepot lowes walmart didnt have any , i ordered it online a little reluctant my first even plant purchase online , but it is doing great so far ! i am happy ! . 
this is excellent green tea it is just a little spicy and very flavorful green tea is so good for you , you wo n't even miss your morning coffee and you are helping children when you buy tea district children 's tribute tea . 
i use this coffee in my espresso maker and all i have to say it wow ! the espresso is smooth , with a hint of chocolate and slightly bitter finish it 's the perfect coffee bean for espresso for me i hate that strong bitter finish you get with some espresso beans \( like starbucks \) and you do n't get that with this coffee i love it and will be ordering more ! . 
best coffee ever still have n't found anything i like better i have never tasted coffee this strong that was n't bitter at all kind of pricey when you start working out what it is costing you per pound but cheaper than buying directly from gevalia if this company started opening stores , starbucks and their bitter brews would go bye bye . 
if i drank more than one commuter cup in the morning i 'd probably need to back off the caffeine a notch or two , but this espresso \( made in my stove top espresso maker \) is delicious and \( almost \) worth getting out of bed for . 
a dark coffee that has no bitterness and is smooth as silk always use quality filtered water and a clean coffee maker if you want a great brew ! . 
i am now on my last box \( of three \) of this gevalia espresso roast and have been impressed it does pack a punch like the other reviewer said one double shot latte of this made in my aeropress at 9pm keeps me up until a good 2am in the morning \) . 
i was given a pack of this coffee as a gift and it had been sitting around for quite a while \( over a year \) when i decided to try it it was without a doubt one of the best coffees that i have tasted very smooth and flavorful i would highly recommend this after that i ordered a supply from amazon they are vacuum packed \( i believe much better than store bought coffee \) i may try the decaf version of this to see how that tastes . 
i love this coffee but i am not sure what has happened to the price lately i used to get this exact product on average for about 15 dollars and the price has skyrocketed to 40 i am hesitant to buy this product again for this price . 
this coffee is splendid i ca n't say much more perfect smoothness , not at all bitter just the perfect dark coffee . 
my husband jut loves this coffee ! i purchased it for him and i actually loved it i am a huge starbucks fan but this also does the job for me i would highly recommend this product . 
i bought this for my husband who has been drinking espresso all his life on a recent trip to italy we bought the lavazza rosa espresso and i was able to find it and order it on amazon i bought the gevalia just to try something new and based on the reviews i thought it might be a good idea my husband loves it and actually prefers it to the lavazza i just bought another 3 pack we use a stove top bialetti and this is fine for that type of maker highly recommend ! ! ! . 
i have been ordering koeze nuts over 20 years now the quality is as good now as they were when i was given my first jar i gave these to my son in law the first christmas we spent together and when he opened them his comment was these are wallhangers they really are the best nuts i 've ever had enjoy ! ! ! . 
the nuts were fresh the container was fine for the price because of the quantity that i ordered the freight was marginal . 
koeze colossal cashews are most delicious cashews i have ever tasted and they are huge br they are n't kidding when they call them jumbo they are so very flavorful br order these and you wo n't be disappointed br \( expect you 'll wish you had ordered a larger size \) . 
these cashews were what i was hoping for , they were large and very fresh they met my expectations i recommend koeze for anyone looking to purchase these especially if they are a gift i was not disappointed . 
i keep these on hand for car trips with the grandkids you can turn a boring bottle of water into a flavorful kool aid drink by just adding a single packet to it just open the bottle , pour in the contents of one packet , then close and shake each packet contains both the kool aid mix and the amount of sugar that 's needed for a single drink perfect size for a typical water bottle we use reusable watter bottles with them , so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the kool aid br br they taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of kool aid , just in a single serving size these single servings work really well for us since we never drink a whole pitcher when me make one , and end up pouring half of it out these were such a great idea ! . 
i have fallen in love with this tea i am a british tea fanatic and ashby 's has superceded my tastes and expectations smooth , not to bitter , low tannins awesome taste ! i 'll take this over pg tips ! . 
the packaging is so cute on all of ashby 's teas and the tea is exceptional i would recommend this tea to anyone . 
if you have dry skin , give this a try a doctor recommended i try this when i complained of itchy skin due to dryness it 's definitely more moisturizing than the bar soaps i used to use br br as someone already mentioned , the packaging design is horrible i used to keep almost empty bottles propped upside down in my shower caddy , but then decided to use a pump bottle instead , which i refill br br dove br if you 're reading this , please redesign these bottles so that they are more user friendly in japan , you sell liquid dove soap in pump bottles , and you even sell refills packaged in plastic bag , which are far more eco friendly and less expensive please consider doing the same for the north american market . 
yeah , i'm a guy just because i'm a guy does n't mean i ca n't want smooth , hydrated skin i bought this stuff on a whim i love it ! the scent is light , so as not to overpower and it does make you feel a little cooler , as well as hydrated i am no longer dry and itchy after a shower ! i combined this stuff with a bodyscrub brush wow ! . 
i'm a guy with hairy arms and hairy legs until i found this stuff , i was using various other body washes with my loofah i always felt like i could never get enough suds and that the application seemed rough and difficult to quickly spread the body wash all over since i started using this stuff \( for a few years now \) , i have n't looked back this stuff is nice and soft and can create a decent amount of suds with somewhat minimal amounts of application on the loofah it goes on smooth and ends up making my skin nice and smooth and it rinses off nice , without leaving my skin rough it works well , has a nice subtle smell , and i wo n't use anything else . 
i ordered personal items for the first time from amazon and i was very satisfied the product came shipped securely and the description of the product matched perfectly i will order again going forward amazon has not disappointed yet i love the dove body wash ! it smells very fresh and clean and really keeps the skin moisturized well i have combination skin . 
this was a great bargain , worked out cheaper than if i had purchased them at a wholesale discount store plus it was elegible for free shipment bonus . 
my wife uses this and she has no complains it makes her smell nice and clean and it foams well great moisturizer inside i personally do n't care for it because it feels slimy on my skin after use i guess that is the moisturizer working very good smell though . 
i just started using this product so i think it is too soon to rate however , the order arrived very quickly . 
high quality body wash that is very thick and lathers quickly and easily it has a very pleasant , flowery smell that lasts for hours after you get out of the shower you only have to use a small amount about the size of a quarter to last your entire shower so even though the product is expensive , you will get a lot of use out of it it seems that the cheaper , dollar a bottle kind i sometimes use only lasts a week or 2 because i have to use more of the product to last throughout a shower br br i would say the smell lasts for around 6 hours or so so it 's almost like perfume my sister in law asked me yesterday , you always smell so good what do you wear \? i was n't wearing any perfume of any kind at the time because it was very early in the morning before i had done my morning routine and i had to run something over there to her i told her that it must just be the body wash if you have ever used dove shampoo or conditioners , it is almost the same smell br br i am looking forward to trying the cucumber green tea kind when i run out of these 4 bottles i would totally recommend this for yourself or for any woman in your life aunt , mother , girlfriend , wife i know many women who would never buy this dove product because they always choose their children and families over themselves , ie buying themselves whatever is cheapest i intend on buying some of this for my mom and aunt to maybe put in a gift basket or care package for them br br i also use this as bubble bath when i take a nice hot bath excellent product a from me . 
i love this body wash it leaves my skin feeling very soft it 's not greasy either worth the extra money to buy the real stuff . 
great product and great scheduled deliveries i get it for my youngest son , who lives in a group home not sure what they do with it all , but at least he 's clean ! . 
very pleased this stuff smells so good my roommies love to sniff the shower after ive been in there the first one got lost in the mail but customer service sent me a second one and upgraded to overnight delivery so it gets 5 stars from me . 
i bought this 4 pack of dove deep wash and three months later i am still using it br i dont think i could use any other product . 
i love this body wash ! it smells nice , works great , and feels great on your skin add in the fact that with the subscribe and save deal , it is a great value , i'm sold ! . 
yes , i have bought this before i like the smell and detest the bottle design i do agree with one of the reviewers that the dove does sell their liquid soaps in pump form in asian countries and sell the refills for them as well i would like it if they have that but i must make due with what i can get at this point in time br br i decided to redo the way i do my bath routine the way i currently do is so time consuming it takes almost an hour to take a shower br so i'm on amazon finding things to aid in my new innovated routine br br like i said before , i have bought this product in walmart but only the single bottles or double bottles that happened to be on sale i love the product it makes me feel soft and silky the scent is pleasant not over powering at all light br br i do n't buy lotion , they 're often heavy and make me feel greasy or they feel weird on my skin i am of the chocolate complexion so i tend to get extremely ashy because i do n't like the way i feel after putting on lotion , so i buy dove body wash , deep moisture i get clean , moisturized and do n't feel greasy after i get out the shower br br edit ! br br i have solved the oddly shaped bottle problem , buy or find one lying around the house , a soap pump for hand soap br i recommend the ones that have had hand soap in them as they are conditioned for everyday use and can hold a thicker capacity soap like this the manufacturer had the bottles made specifically for their product , their product is thick i 've read and heard that the ones you buy empty are for thin lotions and what not br br if you use an old soap bottle clean it out first and fill with the dove soap , and use in the shower , if you can find a 24 oz bottle \( maybe from one of doves hair pumps rinsed out , \) they 're 25oz , big enough to fit all of it and strong enough for thick products such as this \( 25oz eliminates the frustrating last bit at the bottom , anything smaller store the remaining in a drawer in the corner upside down so you can squeeze the rest in the bottle without fighting with it too much , by the time you get to that second half in the bottle it 'll be where you want it and you do n't come out the shower looking like you got into a fight with a dove soap deep moistruizing body wash bottle xd . 
both my husband and i use this body wash we both have dry skin and feels it does a really good job as a moisturizing body wash it is a little pricey here , basically comparable to store prices \( walmart supermarket \) i order for convenience , one less item i have to waste time at a store getting with our busy lives it is needed so we tend to get many items from amazon , mostly through the subscribe and save program . 
great for stocking up and keeping a few in the closet i like to buy things in bulk and this was a good deal and smells good too . 
i use this product every time i shower and it is great i usually get horribly dry skin in the winter but this along with dove lotion keeps my skin soft and smooth ! the smell is good , not overwhelming and you get alot of product , the bottle is huge very comparable to department store body washes \( i have kiehls , chanel , and shiseido \) except a lot more affordable . 
needed the soap b 4 weekend ordered on thurs and paid the extra next day shipping \( even though i'm prime \) because no delivery here on sat \) stuff came s promised on friday and in good package the price of the soap , like lots of other stuff nowadays on amazon , was higher than local stores so ck prices first amazon aint the lowest , usually , anymore . 
i like the item or i would not have ordered it , however , i ordered 100 and 100 was confirmed when the order arrived it contained only 96 , four short rather skimpy i usually like to receive what i ordered and for which i paid full price . 
this tea is what it is supposed to be , it is good , the packaging was good , and the tea is excellent . 
i 've been using lourdes chimichurri for years the stuff is awesome i use it mostly when cooking fish but have recently started to put it in my family 's sandwiches we 're also big fans of the guava and mango spreads highly recommend these products if you 're looking for great taste without the preservatives . 
i started using a href http www amazon com gp product b008ema3as lourdes gourmet chimichurri sauce a on my grilled steaks and fell in love with it now i'm putting it on my chicken , vegetables pasta i'm turning into a real chimichurri addict . 
i absolutely love this product ! i use it on chicken , beef and as veggie spread ! its also good in recipe 's for a little extra kick ! . 
i was introduced to the blair chips by a friend i mostly ignore potato chips because i really do n't like them however , these i like the most among all the chips in the blair line they are savory and can be eaten rapidly the hot chips are good because they are so hot , i cannot eat them fast i am so happy i cannot get them at local stores because i would eat them all the time . 
these cashews are the best i 've ever had and the containers they come in are the perfect size . 
the content has been consistantly good the calamares have been tasty the price was also very reasonable . 
at my local costco store , i bought pace salsa numerous times the salsa tastes feel rich and i love the jalepenos pace puts in the salsa spicy , but not too the point where i'm sweating and ca n't enjoy my salsa and chips br br the salsa does n't feel watered down and this is a great go to salsa choice . 
i have a husband who could bathe in pace picante salsa , i wish amazon would put it on their subscribe and save program i ordered two bottles and during shipment one of the lids broke and salsa went everywhere amazon immediately gave me my money back , i'm surprised my husband did n't eat the salsa soaked box for dinner . 
the sodium and sugar \( often corn syrup \) in tomato sauces is frightening plus , w them you eat white pasta to boot but w salsa you eat rice and beans trust me do n't buy your sauces around your meals , get salsa and plan meals around it br br they arrived in a day or two and the bottles were shiny and fresh , i was afraid of warehouse dust and old stock the vendor did really well . 
these are really great tasting cookies i like the combination of peanut butter and chocolate a nice change from the usual chocolate chip cookies . 
these arrived fresh and in very good shape , just like buying from the local store only cheaper and delivered to my door ! . 
i was looking for snacks to buy in bulk for school lunches and this fit the bill perfectly it helped that my 7 year old loves chips ahoy , but for convenience alone , this was a great purchase since i have free shipping through amazon prime . 
the price is great , the serving is just right for a snack , and its a cookie buy a bunch and they send it to your house ! ! . 
these cookies are both yummy and well priced i recommend them other cookies i like are mrs fields \( packaged \) , chips ahoy soft baked , fig newtons , oreos , and elf cookies . 
this is not a gourmet chocolate chip cookie , but is the best chocolate chip cookie that we have found in the grocery store it is not too firm or soft , has a good amount of flavorful chocolate chips , and makes for a nice snack or dessert we have eaten these for years in my house . 
it 's a lot of cookies , but the price is very good compared to the local grocery store the packages were in good shape and the cookies were fresh my order from january 25th has an expiration date of april 28th not bad , but i would have preferred a later expiration date other than that , no problems exactly the same chips ahoy you would buy in the store . 
delicious cookies i actually thought i was ordering the white chocolate chunk cookies , not the chewy , but definitely enjoyed these the only down side , is these seem awfully small . 
exactly what i wanted individual packages of cookies that i could n't find at a store shipping was only 99cents and came to be in about 3 days br br it was great ! . 
i really like the crunchy chocolate chip cookies the soft ones are chemically softened and , i think , gross these have good flavor and are great for trips \( although eating anything crunchy in the car is discouraged wait for a rest stop ! \) and especially for preschooler snacks . 
i have a bit of a sweet tooth i 've tried to ignore it in times past , but the reality is that i want need a cookie from time to time as a welcome addition to my brown bag lunch these 1 4 ounce single servings make that easy without overdoing it if i bring one with me i know i 'll only end up eating one package and not half of a 12 ounce package ! single servings help keep the portion size healthy while not killing your soul by ignoring your need for some desert br br reasonably priced and shipped to your door , these are a great purchase . 
wow so far , two two star reviews one obviously had no idea what they were ordering the other wants crispy cookies hey , i'm sorry but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look before ordering br br these are chocolate oatmeal cookies if you do n't like that combination , do n't order this type of cookie i find the combo quite nice , really the oatmeal sort of calms the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut type consistency now let 's also remember that tastes differ so , i 've given my opinion br br then , these are soft , chewy cookies as advertised they are not crispy cookies , or the blurb would say crispy , rather than chewy i happen to like raw cookie dough however , i do n't see where these taste like raw cookie dough both are soft , however , so is this the confusion \? and , yes , they stick together soft cookies tend to do that they are n't individually wrapped , which would add to the cost oh yeah , chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet br br so , if you want something hard and crisp , i suggest nabiso 's ginger snaps if you want a cookie that 's soft , chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal , give these a try i'm here to place my second order . 
sardines are a useful item to stock for times when you want to add a bit of protein to your meal without breaking the bank i like that they are lower in mercury than big fish are , and high in omega fats the skinless ones are much better tasting in my opinion regular sardines taste a bit too oily , fishy , and strong to me they are fairly neutral with the absence of added oil or much salt and this makes them versatile i sometimes add lemon and mayonnaise for a sandwich filling , mix with egg , oatmeal , onion and lemon and fry for a fish patty , or add them to a salad although i think these from roland are very good , i liked the seasons skinless sardines , which are also sold by amazon , even better for flavor and texture . 
this is a very tasty product tastes more like tuna however i believe the 35mg of salt listed on the indgredients for a 1 4 cup serving is much lower than the actual salt content i use very little salt and these are somewhat salty i also opened a can of crown prince natural brisling sardines in water which has a salt content of about 45 mg the crown prince tasted much less salty than the roland sardines so i think roland needs to be a little more careful about their packaging and list of ingredients my guess is the salt content is comparable to a can of water packed tuna , maybe 210 mg or higher per 1 4 cup serving . 
i like this product much better than the canned sardines i am able to find at my local grocery stores i buy rolland and seasons \( both sold by amazon \) and in my opinion they are superior in both taste and texture it is a toss up for me as to skinned and boneless opposed to the skin on with bones i like both there are probally more nutrients in the ones with bones , which , along with the omega 3s is the plus factor for sardines they work for me i have eaten them since i was a kid i 'll turn 80 in july incidentally , my cat is crazy about them too . 
sardines are rising in popularity as people discover more about their health benefits and that they are n't so stinky after all \( especially less so after cooking ! \) br br i 've used numerous varieties of the roland sardines olive oil , s b in olive oil , tomato sauce , etc the s b version with low sodium and packed in water is my best recommendation preference a great value for the money , and practically a steal when you compare per ounce the price with other brands then , consider the discount \( s \) when purchasing through amazon , and it 'll be tough to choose another why \? many other brands charge the same price as or more than roland with only a 3 5 oz tin , whereas roland includes more fish in the tin the quality is consistent , and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stir fries , salads , pasta dishes , etc without overpowering the other flavors br br oddly enough , i was half mindful when perusing a semi local dollar store which is renowned for carrying a ton of food items in my city i was looking to make some lower cost and healthier choices in my diet at the time \( not expecting to find these , of course , but rather turning my nose up at the usual crud i saw stocked there \) when i accidentally stumbled across them at 1 per tin , it was a huge buy , so i tried a few the rest , as they say , is history as aforementioned . 
just had my 1st can of these sardines and i am delighted ! big sardines in the can with a most excellent mild flavor made a tuna salad but used sardines wonderful ! i have to say that i really did n't notice that they were low sodium as far as affecting the overall sardine taste love the ones without oil as i do n't really like that greasy fish taste you get with some sardines i just got diagnosed with hypothyroidism , and i read that sardines are good to help restore your thryoid function i 'll be ordering more of these ! . 
roland s b sardines are the best you can buy and believe me , i 've tried them all also amazon 's price is half what i had been paying . 
after the doc said cut the salt , and tuna is expensive and pyekky with no sodium , and of little health benefit , i 've been looking for eitzehs br no salt \? tasteless food \? i 'll be a misery ! br i took this product , added some lemon juice and sprayed on some liquid smoke from an atomizer bottle i comanddered for the occasion , mished it up , and it tastes great on a matzah ! br i can even extend it a little bit by adding some shredded lettuce to the mix , and it is my fave breakfast ! br low sodium means getting creative br mustard , balsamic vinegar , lemon juice , worchestershire sauce and liquid smoke have been staples for replacing salt , though none comes close br if you have another salt replacement ingredient to add , please ! put a reply here ! br thanks ! bitayavon ! . 
water based sardines without salt is awwfuul not bad of a product here far superior to the types i normally purchase at stores . 
i love canned sardines and when they put me on a low salt diet br i figured that was the end of my sardines until i found these they taste fantastic , the price is reasonable and you can at least have br something that before these sardines was not available to people br on a low salt diet side benefits as they are skinless and boneless br thanks to the roand co . 
these are really good , the sodium is ok based upon the daily allowance it is a great fast meal when you do not want to cut on the stove and it is really good when added to a salad so far the low fat sardines has aided me in my weight loss , i am going to continue roland 's product until i reach my final goal weight they taste good , a litte coarse and dry but i normally add the juice to a fork full i love them i learned not to be too critical and enjoy the little things in life . 
i 've eaten a lot of sardines in my life and by far these are the best the extra cost of boneless skinless is worth it cos there is more to eat and less waste love the water packed instead of the gooeyness of oil excellent . 
4 5 just water and large pieces of sardines open for all types of combinations of which i find the old whole grain crackers , quality cheese , a particle of mayo and mustard and a hot cup of tea , the most appealing they do lunch in a hurry and snack times as well solid product even drank the water in which they are laid to rest and not too shabby sardines are good for a person , everyone agrees on that even a sardine sandwich sounds about right in the next few minutes \( the better the bread the better the sandwich \) so yes , 4 solid stars and i am hungry for the product right now , come to think of it ! . 
the product arrived on time and is delicious thanks very much the price was very fair what else needs to be said \? . 
i buy skinless sardines packed in water to keep my intake of sodium and chloresterol down for about 2 a can including tax and delivery i feel i am getting my money 's worth i cannot get these kinds of sardines at the local supermarket br br sardines are somewhat tasteless i put the sardines on salad and top the salad with olive oil and red wine vinegar if i eat the sardines as a sandwich , i used mustard , which also has no salt and chloresterol . 
i have had to change my diet and now have better health these are very tasty . 
i 've tried many brands of sardines these are my favorite even with low sodium , they are full of flavor excellent choice . 
these are the best skinless boneless sardines that i 've tried and they are very reasonably priced they remind me a little more of tuna fish than sardines , but in a mild , rather than bad , way and are very firm for water packed fish i especially like these mixed with salsa they work out to 1 57 can or 36 oz if you choose the longer , but free , shipping . 
i'm on a very low sodium intake 300mgs per day and these are great good taste and low sodium i just put a little mustard on them and yum ! . 
this is a favorite chocolate bar of several family members , made so by a visit to germany hard to find in the states glad to know where to get them . 
yum ! i could live off of this stuff the peach flavor is refreshing and delicious it 's no longer sold where i live , and i really miss it \( ca n't even get it from amazon \) it 's just too good to be discontinued . 
i usually find the citrus sodas too tart acidic for my tastes , and i find the black cherry fresca too cloyingly sweet i love the peach it 's so crisp and refreshing without being acidic , and is just the right sweet for me other than ginger ale , it 's my favorite white soda i have been having trouble finding this in the grocery , and really hope it has n't been discontinued . 
i was looking for a low calorie cocktail and mixed a rose wine with the fresca peach and it was delicious and i am not a regualar soda drinker and do n't normally drink rose wine make sure to get a rose that is not sweet or you might as well drink kool aid look for off dry or bone dry rose 's , maybe made with a syrah , cabernet , merlot , tempranillo , sangiovese zinfandels tend to be too sweet for my taste , but you might like it a sparkling rose would be great too you can serve this with ice in a cocktail glass or without ice in a martini glass . 
this is an excellent product id does what it says , it will bring shine and health to your pets coat , and the dogs love it . 
i was looking for a healthy alternative to regular wheat grass which is becoming harder to find in health stores and this is not just for me ! i also grow this in trays for my 2 cats who live indoors , deprived of valuable natural chlorophyll all mammals need it , and we are now enjoying a strong , healthy organically grown variety which is easy to grow and lasts a long time wheat grass has larger blades than lawn grass which does not induce the cats to being sick they crave it and are very healthy with glossy soft coats , their energy levels are better , and they are playing more both are perfectly healthy chlorophyll is kind of like eating liquid sunshine mixed in with vegetation it does a body good ! if you care about your \( or other \) bodies , then get this very nice product the shipping is fast and it is packaged well the cans are sealed well with a tight fitting lid yes , i am going to continue ordering from this vendor again they have exactly what i am looking for . 
i wanted to give these soy crisps more justice than just the 5 stars \( and ordering them all the time \) i bought a bag of these sea salt flavor crisps and a bag of bbq crisps about a month ago , in a bid to eat more healthy food i 've always loved bbq chips , especially ruffles and lays k c masterpiece chips , but they 've got to be killing me slowly , right \? so i busted open the bbq soy crisps and gagged how could this be bbq \? they tasted like cardboard , and i gave them to my friends who will eat anything i begrudgingly opened the sea salt bag , and though more palatable , i was still disappointed \( i know i thought you said 5 stars it gets better \) br br anyway , i had sworn off chips and midday snacking , so for two weeks i saw nothing on the counter but genisoy soy crisps i 'd eat two or three here and there , and when i ran out , i bought 2 bags of the sea salt flavor again what happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive my body forgot what those strong bbq flavored chips were like , and i started craving soy crisps i began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor , like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars , which i had completely missed before , apparently because it was n't a sweet , red crusted , overbearing bbq powder i polished the next bags off in three days br br now , i'm ordering 12 here on amazon \( 1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food \) my advice is this give these soy crisps a chance , but do n't mix them in with your regular doritos and bbq ruffles or you 'll think they 're awful stop eating , for a month , the oily bbq chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips you 'll feel better about snacking ! . 
i found out about these from a co worker they are delicious , low calorie , and pack some protein eating these rather than my usual pretzels and chips helped me slim down i get them by the case now from amazon since it is a better buy \( and my supermarket does n't always carry them \) . 
for people watching weight or nutrition , these chips are an excellent substitute for regular chips they have plenty of protein as well br amazon 's price is much cheaper than buying packs at the local grocery store . 
i love light crispy salty snacks , and soy crisps is the best one of those i 've found at only 100 calories per serving 350 calories for the bag , you could literally eat the entire bag \( which i do on a regular basis \) and not feel bad about it br br there are several flavors but deep sea salt is my favorite because it is subtle and just enhances the natural flavor of the rice and soy br br so delish ! shipped fast with all crisps in tact great purchase , re ordering . 
these are one of my favorite ways to eat grains plus they are a good source of protein 17 chips per serving is just about right i wish they had a little less salt but for the calorie fat fiber content , they are pretty healthy great with soup or salads or just plain i would definitely recommend these . 
just the same thing i use to buy in the stores but for less same great taste , same great package same eveything because it is the exact same thing , love is stuff thanks . 
i am a huge fan of genisoy soy crisps \( deep sea salted flavor \) br i love the crunch and texture of this non greasy snack the flavor is subtle and very light no heavy salty taste or greasy lips or fingers after eating i also like that i can really indulge on these and not feel the regret of eating too many calories soy crisps are my fav crunchy treat , , lt . 
i love this flavor of soy crisps deep sea salted however , they are not available in the smaller individual size like most of the other flavors are my husband prefers the lightly salted ones because they are crispier that the sea salted ones he 's right , but i do like this softer crunch too it sort of reminds me of popcorn in fact , i do n't mind the big bag on occasions for example if it is a replacement for a big bag of popcorn while watching a movie ! what a nice healthy treat ! . 
i'm a big fan of the carbs , fat and protein balance of these crisps the salt is n't overpowering and the taste is ok i 've had better soy chips \( genisoy tortilla chips \) but these are alright if you do n't like the crunch of a chip . 
stores are not carrying this product thank goodness i can still get them ! ! ! ! a href http www amazon com gp product b000cmhmuc genisoy soy crisps , deep sea salted , 3 85 ounce bags \( pack of 12 \) a . 
i love these soy crisps they are the perfect salty crunch i have a hard time finding snack foods that do n't have wheat , corn , or some sort of sugar sweetener in them but these fit the bill they are very salty , tho i like them that way , but if you 're not used to it and can be kindof surprising . 
these soy crisps are an excellent choice for snacking with 7 grams of protein in each serving , they are so much better for you than potato chips or other snack foods they have a great flavor , just enough salt , and leave you feeling satisfied nutritionally and snackwise ! my grandchildren know these crisps are what they will be offered at my house for snacking i highly recommend them . 
i recently found out that i am allergic to wheat and milk as you can imagine , this severely limits my snacking options my local grocery was clearancing all of their organic section , so i tried these they are so good ! i love salted plain rice cakes \( did before my diet change too \) these add an extra punch of flavor and crunch ! yum ! . 
i have a very bad habit of snacking that i ca n't get rid of so i purchased this to make snacking a little less bad the first time i tried it i was like ugh it 's gross ! but soon it started to grow on me it 's very crispy , without being a deep fried potato chip it 's lightly salted , and does n't have 12 different fattening , unhealthy seasonings and flavorings one entire bag is only like 350 calories it 's actually quite good i really like it now , and i find myeslf reaching for a bag of gensoy before any type of chip . 
these are the most consistent soy crisps i have had they are light , flavorful , and always fresh and usually arrive in very good condition \( not crumbs \) they are a bit salty , but that 's the only point that might be bad just depends on what you 're expecting . 
these soy crisps are very filling and satisfying if you are looking for something with a great salty crunch , these are for you br br they are high in fiber and protein , and that is great if you are trying to watch your calorie intake br br i think they are great and recommend them highly . 
i really love these snacks they are low in calories and fat while being high in protein , which is important to me because i am a vegetarian . 
this has been my favorite soup since childhood i was pleased to find it available on amazon com at a very reasonable price now i plan to keep a good supply on hand at all times ! . 
zomg these cookies are sooo good ! ! i just bought some at the grocery store today after craving raspberry sweets wow , was this more than what i was expecting between the chocolate , the raspberry and the cookie it 's heavenly they actually put a nice and consistent amount of filling in these unlike most store bought brands i would definitely recommend them , and i will surely buy them again when i'm having a raspberry and chocolate craving . 
i bake , so i'm rarely impressed by store bought cookies this one , though divine so divine i do n't like heavy chocolate , or dark chocolate , but i like a little chocolate this cookie is the right amount pastry , raspberry and chocolate , and it 's light , like a madeleine . 
my girlfriend and i bought some of this at stater bros for 4 or 5 bucks worth every penny we use this on sandwiches instead of mayo it is the best stuff it 's not healthy at all , in fact it is really bad for you , so keep that in mind . 
i am a mustard lover , i eat mustard on everything without a doubt it is the greatest unfortunately you can only buy in a few stores beaver honey mayonnaise mustard br maggie . 
i love this beaver brand honey n mustard mayonnaise sauce it is the best combination that i have ever used makes a great dipping sause for cheeses . 
love this product very flavorable to most anything works great on lunch meat , ham , potato salad , more something similar is sold at honey baked ham locations , but this product is much better . 
i bought the blue icicle because i had to quickly record some trumpet lines and i did n't have an interface well , actually , i did pick up an open box unit that did n't work because they could n't provide me with the external power supply , so i took it back and got the icicle as a quick fix that would get me where i needed to go in a timely manner br br hardware imac , dual core 2 0 ghz processor and 4 gb or ram os 10 5 8 br software garage band br mic shure sm57 br br pros for recording trumpet with an sm57 it was perfect clear sound , low noise , lots of signal with the gain a little over half way on the icicle and about 58 in garage band i got hot horn lines with gain to spare any hotter and they would have started clipping , so it definitely gave enough signal to get the job done br br cons the gain knob has no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it it has to be done by feel making it almost impossible to duplicate your settings exactly this could be improved with a knob with an arrow and a marked dial so you can see where it 's set it also feels a bit cheap it 's lightweight and feels almost fragile treated with care it 's fine , but i doubt it would take much abuse before it would break and i have been ultra careful with it because it feels so lightweight and cheap i also used it as recommended in the accompanying literature and did n't plug it directly into the back of the mic i used it with a mic cable br br for what i needed it was perfect simple plug and play that got good sound into my computer , and it worked well in a pinch i just wish it was a little higher quality in terms of construction a bit heavier and a better dial for the analog gain , and i would have rated it a full 5 stars but as it is , i can at best give it 4 . 
this is all that i needed to make my condensor mic work ! i have an mlx 990 and it works great with it ! without this i was going to need to buy a preamp , and something that converted xlr to usb and a phantom power generator this little thing does it all it does exactly what it says it does , nothing more and nothing less br i am not a professional recorder by any means i just wanted to set up a small studio in my room and be able to have my mic go straight to my laptop without having to buy a small soundboard this might not work for someone who has a fancier setup than mine , but for my basic stuff it works amazing br br the only thing i was surprised about was the size in the picture it looks like its really small , but its really like 1 1 2 round and as long as my hand it in no way effects the performance or anything i just thought it was noteworthy br br if this was helpful please take a few seconds to hit the helpful button above i would really appreciate it \) . 
i have several of these converters in my home studio the quality is amazing on both dynamics and condenser mics ! i had an icicle that initially had a low hum , contacted blue , and they said that the first 500 units produced had a low hum but that has since been fixed they sent me a replacement unit and it works perfectly now buy this product if you have the need . 
the icicle is truly a great piece of hardware it 's as simple as plugging your mic cord into the product and plugging that into your usb the best thing about this product is it allows you to take your mic wherever there is a usb equipped computer it is light weight so i do n't know it 's durability and do n't plan on throwing it to find out the icicle comes with a gain knob which is a plus but remember with this is a 60 dollar plug n play tool so it does n't have any other features br br also i did n't have the noise feedback issue . 
though this micpreamp has several weaknesses , i give this 5 stars because it 's just perfect for what i do br br i 've been finding ways to record vocal in convenient way with good quality everyone told me i'm suppose to get audio interface for good vocal recording , but audio interfaces always ended up with frustration br br after seeing several reviews of icicle , i was going to return this , but once i used it , i do n't think i want to return it anymore br br this preamp is way beyond my expectation br br however , like i mentioned above , it has weaknesses so this might not be a solution for many people br br 1 \) it has no headphone jack for direct monitoring br 2 \) no asio driver br 3 \) only one input br 4 \) does not look strong so always be careful br br if you are a person like me who just to need to record vocal conveniently using easy software like cool edit or audacity , you wo n't regret . 
i tried this on both mac os x and on vista \( not on the same computer \) , and it worked perfectly with both although vista was a little confusing , nothing more was involved than finding the right audio preferences no drivers in either case i recorded a short review of the blue for each setup , with each setup , which i posted on my devnotes posterous com blog you can search that out and listen to both of them if you have any doubts about the sound the whole thing lights up blue when it 's plugged in , so if you love blue , this mic 's for you i have a behringer condenser mic , about the least expensive mic you can find , but it sounded great before and it sounds great through the blue icicle . 
i 've owned this product for about a year already and it is still working completely fine although , there was a few technical issues i had to figure out myself there 's no problem with the blue icicle itself though there would be a problem when trying to install this with windows 7 there was no problem at all using it with windows xp it seemed like it would install a different driver instead of it being 'blue icicle' instead , it would show up as 'usb multi channel audio device' it just did n't sound the same when i was using it with windows xp it sounded more louder with some feedback in the background what i did to fix this problem was to uninstall the 'usb multi channel audio device' driver from device manager , then unplug the icicle and plug it back in when the 'installing device driver software' notification pops up , click it and click 'skip obtaining driver software from windows update' it will now be installed as 'blue icicle' and work like how it should be ! make sure you raise the levels up in sound in control panel if the mic sounds too low for you , even with the gain control volume up it should n't be up that high anyways as it would have some feedback in the background i'm not sure if i'm the only one with this problem , but i hope this helps whoever does ! br br when i first got the icicle , it sounded amazing and i had a lot of fun with it ! i still do , too ! i use this with my audio technica at2020 i use it almost everyday , whether if it 's for music producing or online gaming with friends and yes , this does work for the ps3 not sure about the xbox 360 though i recommend this product for anyone who does n't have a mixer for their microphone 'cause mixers are kind of expensive ! haha . 
great usb audio interface ! i also own the shure x2u and they perform just about the same i wish i would have known that before i spent way more on the x2u . 
put simply this is a brilliant piece of kit does exactly what it says on the tin converts any xlr mic to usb including phantom power supply br br we have an neuman professional condenser mic here at blockhouse tv and i kid you not it sounds amazing with this piece of kit have plugged into our mac and thrown the signal into audacity and or final cut pro and it sounds the business no hum , noise , clicks or pop we use it to voice the children 's animation dvd series jack and holly both the actors and the tech staff find it a really easy and portable set up to use ok looks are n't great and it 's plastic but i do n't really give a monkey 's about that all i care about is the signal to noise ratio , the sound quality and can it power our very expensive mics \? the answer is yes it can we say buy ! br br a href http www amazon com gp product b004am5pz4 jack and holly 's christmas countdown \( us format \) a a href http www amazon com gp product b00439gwtm jack and holly 's christmas countdown \( european format \) dvd a . 
i already have the bluebird from blue and was using it to record a friend 's live performance with only a laptop computer at my disposal , i was able to connect my xlr to usb directly into garageband the icicle is small , portable , and so easy to use plus , i did n't have to carry a huge a to d converter ! . 
read a few reviews , some good and some bad , and i finally decided to take the risk since the icicle was on sale br br works great and is perfect for a home room studio br br i love everything blue though the icicle is a little light and delicate , i treat it as careful as i do my microphone br br i would highly recommend this product . 
have only had the need to use this a few times , but it has always performed well and consistently nice that it has a little preamp so you can control levels does n't seem to color the tone in any negative way . 
i have little doubt that the blue icicle will get the job done with a shure sm 58 , or similar dynamic microphone but its claim that it will convert any condenser mic , even one that normally requires xlr connection and phantom power , into a plug 'n play usb mic should not be taken at face value i say this because i have an acquaintance with the original audio technica at2020 condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion in the long run , he would have been ahead \( in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks \) by purchasing the at2020 usb mic as it is , the blue icicle is probably the best such converter on the market \( the comparably priced lightsnake cable will not convert condenser mics , despite what you may have read \) so , if necessary , give it a try and more than one but make sure there are return privileges . 
works fine for my podcasting needs i use it with a sure sm58 microphone it is made of plastic and does feel cheap but i have had it for a few months and had zero problems with it for desktop use it should be fine works great for my needs would n't recommend for heavy use on a stage or being tossed around . 
it does what it says i was only worried that either it would n't be compatible with my mic , or that my computer would n't recognize it , but everything turned out great it 's plug and play , my computer \( running windows 7 \) instantly recognized it and i was able to use this right away \( in less than 5 minutes from unboxing it \) br br it seemed like a joke to me at first , because it is so small and lightweight , so i thought it would n't actually supply phantom power or something like that , but it actually does , so this is pretty great what i love most about this is that it is extremely portable and easy to set up , i definitely recommend this . 
this device does one thing and it does it well i use it to record demos and it provides a crisp , clean sound with zero noise ! i have read some reviews where people complain about the durability of the icicle while it feels a little chinsy , i hardly think it will snap in half the price is right and the sound is great br br for the most part , setting the icicle up is incredibly easy i had a few instances where i had to reboot for windows to recognize it again and such , but no serious headaches br br overall , this is a great device to have on hand of for the traveling musician who wants to quickly lay down ideas on the road . 
this thing is great i am running a bluebird into the icicle into logic 9 and the sound i am getting is tremendous there 's little to no noise , but it boosts the signal plenty i 've had no trouble with not having enough gain , i have plenty of sound another thing is that i do n't think it feels as light and toy like as a lot of people here have stated just treat it with care , and do n't drop it like any piece of musical equipment fantastic buy for the money , recommended . 
i have used the icicle a few times , and it sounds great ! everything works how it 's supposed to , and it is a very simple but efficient interface the only thing that i can see that 's wrong with it , is it just feels light and cheap granted its only around 40 so you ca n't expect too much from it the plastic just feels rather cheap but i plan on treating it very nicely and gently anyways so all in all i do n't foresee a major problem on that front . 
i was somewhat skeptical about purchasing any xlr to usb adaptor , but i have to say this thing works great ! the recordings are crisp and clear , just as good as recording on my camcorder in pcm ! now , i can record directly to my pc without the need of mini dv tapes and capturing the audio to the computer ! the unit is a bit cheap feeling \( weight wise \) but do n't let that fool you one bit ! br br it 's true plug and play too ! no need for any additional drivers software simply plug everything together and you 're off and running ! overall , it 's a great product ! i highly recommend this for anyone who does any amount of voice recording ! . 
3 years ago i bought a digidesign 002 protools rack and a lot of other equipment to start recording but i could never get it to work with my os on either computer i was at an impasse for a long time until i saw this product on blue 's website i already had a 400 condenser mic in the closet i had never gotten to use and did n't want to spend more money on a quality usb mic i could n't be happy that this product exists in it 's quality or price ! i noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem it does exactly what it 's suppose to do act like it does n't exist it just serves it purpose to convert the signal well , and stays out of the way on everything else it does feel light weight and the signal was a little lower than i thought \( as many reviews said \) and that is the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars but i do n't think that should keep anyone from getting this product . 
i 've had this product for 6 or 7 months at this point and i use it for podcasting i 've used 3 different mics one was dynamic and the other two condenser all three have worked just fine as if i had plugged them into a mixer or a pa system , no problems i have also beaten the crap out of this thing , knocked it around way too much and left it on the floor at my desk where i record , no problems still runs fine and it 's not showing any signs of stopping this thing is also super easy , plug and record on any software including the free audacity software , garage band , and sony acid \( the three i 've tested \) br one problem , that gain knob , while very useful , is super super touchy i found a volume i liked and then taped it down , otherwise it 'll jack up or down the gain with the slightest jostling does n't make this a bad product , it just means have some tape handy and this is a quick and easy solution especially for podcasters who do n't want to be limited to the usb microphones and do n't want to shell out big money for a usb compatible mixer . 
using it for recording vocals on home pc using shure c606 mic it is a big improvement over the mic to stereo in for sure there is no background noise which was very prevailant in the mic in method the 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the gain even with the gain knob turned all the way up i still had to add gain from my software for the sound to be loud enough but overall a great product do not regret buying it and would recommend it as well . 
ive heard mixed reviews of this yeah it feels cheap but so what \? ! just take care of it like you would anything like that ! and it sounds perfect ! i use it to record vocals on logic studio \( i get others to sing , i cannot but they sound amazing \) ive had no problems with it and im super happy with the purchase well worth the money ! . 
pros easy to use plug it in , set your levels and go ! works well with condenser mics has 48v phantom power runs solely off usb \( no need for a wall wart \) br br cons very plastic feels like it could snap with the slightest bit of rough handling ! i would n't try to plug it directly into a mic use an xlr cable no headphone monitoring jack and quite a bit of latency when monitoring with a separate interface i would not recommend it for dynamic mics i tried it with my rode procaster dynamic mic and could not get high enough levels without practically yelling into the mic i also tried it with an old v tech handheld stage mic and levels were a little better , so dynamics with a higher line output might work better with it br br overall , it does what it 's supposed to , but it could be a lot better for about 30 40 more , you can get better interfaces with 2 mic inputs , but this one is nice for situations where running off of usb power is a must . 
simple , plug in setup garageband recognizes it right away , as long as it 's opened as first step , before plugging in icicle nice , clean , transparent sound without much coloring with my electrovoice stage mic depending upon your setup , you may have to crank up your inputs and headphone volumes to get comfortable levels blue recommends plugging directly into computer a great little device for the price ! . 
brought this product for recording a radio program from home along with the behringer br c 1 microphone , provides a cost effective solution . 
i have some nice mics round my place for video and thought i could use them to help my skype chats , and for the money it is amazing little usb device . 
i was a little concerned after reader some of the reviews here , but the warranty , blue 's reputation , and amazon customer service convinced me to give it a try and in general , i'm pretty satisfied with it using it with one of my oktava mk 301 microphones i get excellent sound , no hum , and so far , excellent reliability i'm using it with audacity and a few other programs , none of which have any difficulty recognizing it there were some issues setting it up initially , and i'm a bit leery about the plastic construction , but for what i paid i think it 's a good value for those thinking of using it in field recording stick it inside a carrying bag , and tape the cable to it to prevent stressing the usb connector you should n't have any problems . 
we 've only had the blue icicle 1 week , but my daughter loves it , and is working with it every day br br how good is it \? my daughter is 18 , and turned down 25 , 000 a year in scholarship money to pepperdine 's music program as a coluratura soprano her voice is so perfectly re produced using a shure 57 and the icicle , that i can not tell when she sings and when she plays it back through the computer , an off the shelf dell , using a pair of 30 jbl computer speakers for sound br br the icicle is really good br br now they can replace the old tv commercial , from is it live , or is it memorex \? br to is it live , or is it blue \? . 
let 's get this out of the way , first yes the case is made of thin flimsy plastic , and it does n't look like it can handle drops to the floor br br i'm using it with a behringer ecm8000 mic and real time analyzer \( rta \) software \( on my laptop running windowsxp pro sp3 \) to precisely tune notch filters and speaker crossover networks and it works perfectly audio output sinewaves show up very clean and accurate under an oscilloscope , with peaks at 90 degrees \( which is a good sign \) no hissing sounds at all , it 's very quiet with a mic connected , high frequency spectrum wise for the record , i bought a usb to toslink output adapter to connect to the amplifier because integrated laptop pc sound cards are usually noisy as hell br br i think some people are using mics with very low sensitivity or crappy output sources \( e g cheesy soundcards , amps , receivers or multimedia speakers \) , or even lousy , improperly shielded mic cables and blaming the unit , but who knows what i can safely say is , for the cheap price , the unit manages to produce an output that has a very high gain and runs virtually flat while covering the entire audio spectrum br br window7 functionality \( updated \) br at first , it did n't work with windows7 x64 ultimate i kept getting a message about not being able to find a driver and at the time the icicle website made no mention of windows 7 compatibility \( 2 months later , they are saying it 's compatible with xp , vista and windows 7 \) after nearly giving up , i found my old usb motorola cell phone charger cable lying around and noticed it had a similar mini usb header to the that of the icicle 's i connected the icicle using the motorola cable into my windows 7 pc , and to my surprise it was recognized i actually got the idea when the icicle began losing its usb connection \( with the original cable \) whenever i moved it around a lot could it be the dinky looking usb cable included with the icile causing intermittent disconnects or driver problems with windows 7 \? i'm really not sure at this point what i can say is that the blue icicle seems 100 reliable when used with the old motorola usb cable perhaps the motorola cable makes better contact or has better shielding who knows \( i'm inclined to cut away the white insulation of the original icicle cable just see if it 's shielded to the usb 's electrical ground source it would n't be the first time i find an unshielded usb cable then again , it might be the mini usb header causing the problem \) . 
this icicle performs flawlessly with very good audio quality for my audio technica cardiod condensor mic took me a short while to figure out the little silver button on the side was n't a button , but instead a rotational knob for setting the gain this device literally plugs into your usb port on a mac , you adjust that knob , and your done you then can forget about the device and enjoy flawless audio performance out of your mic this beats the hell out of the more expensive firewire solutions i had used before . 
i have now owned this product for over a year and it is still going strong i mainly use it for voice overs for youtube videos , skype calls , and recording music it all works great br br when i first received it in the mail , i simply opened it , plugged it in , and it worked as simple as that there were no drivers , no installation , and no updates i just plugged my xlr condenser microphone into the icicle and the icicle to the usb on my computer and it was immediately recognized as a usb mic br br this product was way lighter than i expected and feels rather cheap however , that is not really an issue because the product works great and the blue glow that lights up when you plug it in adds some nice visual appeal br br the knob is also useful , as it allows you to control the sensitivity of the mic br br overall , i am extremely satisfied with this product , as it is plug and play very simple , and it just works . 
i use this with my audio technica condensor works great for home recordings hooked up to garageband on macbook pro for rough recordings its super simple to use and has a dial for the gain it 's not bulky which is a nice . 
this people is a must have especially to take xlr over to usb it provides un interrupted audio flow during recording and provides phantom power great invention ! . 
this thing works instantly you plug in your mic and plug the usb into your computer it will light up , then you adjust the sound to what is audible it can get pretty loud i was intimidated at first when contemplating the purchase because of the low price but it has done everything i needed it for the other preamp models i was looking at were near 200 br br the only downside to this is that it looks plastic i do n't consider it a con because the look doesnt really matter . 
the icicle is an excellent product , works as advertised i think it 's the easiest way to attach a quality mic directly to your computer br the icicle is a fine plug play mic interface . 
going from the 600 digidesign mbox to this 15 tube made me feel like i got back at digidesign for screwing all of us who had xp computers that they refused to support after we bought their over priced gear for recording voice overs br i could wish that the blue ice converter was made of heavier materials and came with a cs department that one could reach but , for 15 well , 'nough said . 
this product has worked since the first day i have had it tremendous buy for me i needed my mic to go directly into the computer thanks . 
bought this because i didnt want to pay 100 plus for the alternative found it to be extremely reliable very crisp sound with little to no background noise before i bought it other reviews stated it seemed a bit cheap i disagree , though i do find it to be a bit bulky for it 's function i did drop and break it once , but it was completely my fault after breaking it , i contacted customer service , and it was replaced very rapidly the company 's website was easy to navigate , and rather amusing . 
i do n't write reviews at all but i'm just going to say that this is a very decent product to buy if you 're not looking to spend hundreds of dollars on a mixer , phantom power supply , and pre amp for xlr mic recording because guess what this little thing has it all in one all for a low price ! cop you one ! . 
patrick gave a spot on explanation of everything , just in different uses personally , i use it vocally , and acoustically and it has worked perfectly in every way , however , either something is lacking in craftsmanship or i find my ability to adjust by feel is a little more connected to using numbers instead of blanks i found the quality just like patrick said i too think it feels almost fragile and , i also used a mic cable because for me , that seemed the most sensible solution because i did n't really need it to move it so , i mounted the connection to my desk and now i move it very little aside from the no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it , on the gain knob , i think it would be awesome if they just threw in some molded heavy something to give it some weight for setting on your desk that would make it secure and you would feel like it had a little better quality in craftsmanship hey maybe even give the connector itself a littl weight to stay put anyways , great product but i guess , thats what he said \? regardless , br br pros does what it says get it if you need it its at an amazing price compared to the a href http www amazon com gp product b001ppxfag shure x2u xlr to usb signal adapter a version this , however , is fantastic for people saving for a new presonus interface like me br br cons craftsmanship appears lacking . 
plugged direct into windows and controlled via ustream tv software interface this worked well , \( although we needed a little more gain obtainable by using better software cubase , garage band etc \) , as an interim setup before we could get a more pro level interface for more than one mic etc nice ! br it feels a bit flimsy construction wise but we were not going to take it on the road ! . 
i use this to record in garageband on my macbook it works unfailingly and sounds as good as it should considering my primitive setup i love the level knob and the quality construction if you read the instructions and use it correctly , this tool is invaluable . 
this product works if you are only looking to do vocals this is a good product so far i 've had it a few months with no experience of sound distortion or loss of power its great if you do n't want to go to the trouble of figuring out how to use a mixer i 've been told a pre amp is better but it seems to work alright for me and my mxl 67g . 
i 've purchased a few of these , and they are very reliable i 've used them with win7 and os x the a d quality is acceptable for most needs the limited bit depth and sample rate are probably the only drawbacks . 
i was really worried when i ordered this that the phantom power would make it overheat , apparently i was worried for nothing ! i use this paired with a blue yeti pro , a seriously beefy microphone , running over shielded cable that is about eighty feet away , it 's absolutely great ! br br the one downside that i have seen from this piece of kit it will occasionally not register as a usb device , granted i only have seen it happen once , but you will always want to double check your connections ! . 
cheap and works well the only thing is the gain on it is a little low even at highest setting other than that ir records well and does what it needs to . 
i create language teaching materials for a living on both pcs and macs not only do i care about the sound quality of audio recordings for voice , but i record a lot of music as well for work i that i do at home , i bought the blue microphones icicle to use with high quality condenser mics before buying i read lots of reviews here and some others online br br when the icicle arrived , it worked fine right of the bat since then i have recorded hours and hours of audio on it , using both pcs and macs not once have i had any problems with the product . 
perfect tool for any musicians trying to make recording much easier at an affordable price br easy to open plastic case , medium sized , durable \( people have said that the plastic body feels cheap br and feels easy to break but it 's not true the icicle 's plastic body feels durable and wo n't break if br you 're not clumsy with it or break it on purpose \) i only wished that the gain control had numbers or indications br of levels so i can turn the knob to the correct position for recording and remember it instead of guessing all the time sound quality is flawless ! no buzzing noises or anything picked up really just nice crispy sound recorded through a good quality microphone is all i hear i hear no difference in it with an icicle or a mixer . 
this product works just as advertised ! ! guitar center told me the only way to connect my mic to my computer was either an expensive converter box or a usb mic a holes haha i love this little gizmo and would definitely recommend it to a friend ! ! . 
i bought the icicle because i have been doing a lot of hip hop vocals and i was using a samson c01u and the thing with that mic you can get close to studio but with so much work and you can always tell that you messed with it alot br br well i always wanted to buy a expensive mic but didnt want to spend 200 more on a usb pre amp so i see this on here the other day and went to guitar center and after deciding for a while i went with it i also already had a mxl v 88 which is a pretty high end condenser mic , although now you can find it for cheap but original rspv 700 and average selling price after it being out was 349 400 but i am very happy br br i use reaper to record vocals with a asio driver \( and it does work with my asio driver \) someone put in their comment that it doesnt for those of you that arnt familure with asio it is a driver program that runs and samples your audio going in , you basically use it with anything that is midi or midi mic to usb it makes your audio not lag and sound more professional also for the people that said the volume was too low , go into sound in windows and turn the mic up a little , i keep mine on 5 also your recording program will let you turn up while your monitoring the record or after br br go ahead and buy one ! . 
i'm glad i came across the blue icicle \( on amazon othere prices where 60 or more \) before i went on to buy a mic , preamp and source for phantom power i literally got i all in one at a verrryyy low price good bargain i recomend it for anyone with a home studio and deff go buy a xlr cable plugging a mic deirectly into it wont work so well . 
a great tool for low budget home recording i mic every track to audacity i use a low budget dynamic mic and the icicle gives the right boost for pc recording i keep the gain at 90 to 100 percent and do volume control on the pc br i see some complaints out there about durability keep in mind it is a piece of computer hardware like a modem or an external hard drive , not something that you would use onstage or throw into a gig bag another plus is no drivers or setup that 's important to me when i get home from work and want to record a tune just plug it in and go ! . 
i needed the icicle to provide better audio quality for recordings i was doing on my pc i wanted to use my high quality xlr mic for this purpose and found that the icicle provided far better performance than any other usb mic that i currently owned i did n't have any problem with the trim pod on the icicle as reported by a previous review so maybe blue mic has corrected that issue br br i have and do recommend this to anyone that wants to use their current xlr mic on their pc the product is great and the price is right . 
great price for what you are getting recording via a usb port rocks ! ! ! ! the only thing that could maybe be improved is the durability it feels like a toothpick in your hand it may be more durable than it feels , but i'm still going to be very careful with it but , for the price this is only a minor gripe great product , i would recommend it to anyone . 
works well it is slightly lighter than expected , but the quality of the sound is excellent . 
muy buen producto por su tama ntilde o , uno lo puede llevar a culquier lado junto con su laptop y hacer culquier grabaci oacute n , en cualquier momento antes de tener este producto , tuve muchos problemas con la entrada de audio en mi mac , pero con el icicle por fin pude tener una entrada decente para cualquier micr oacute fono hasta el momento no genera ruidos de ning uacute n tipo y la calidad es impresionante para algo tan simple . 
bought it thinking this would plug into the wii and i would be able to use my condenser microphone with it well , long story short , doesnt work but it is still usable with a pc laptop to record audio but we can do that with a builtin mic also would u like to pay 1 towards the presidential election \? . 
this product is excellent for the group of people who have celiac disease a tasty treat for sunday brunch the only problem i have , is the cost , but br as we all know , being saddled with celiac disease is not cheap . 
so life with a gluten allergy can sometimes seem unfair however , once bisquick started making this product , things got a lot more equal it tastes like bisquick it works like bisquick hey , it is bisquick it just happens to be gluten free perfect pancakes ! enough said . 
finally a gluten free mix that tastes great ! i have used this mix over and over and i have never been disappointed it works just the way the regular mix works and it has opened up a whole new world for me i thought i would never be able to find a mix that i like , but this one i love i am excited about trying all the fun things i can do with it even cookies ! . 
the first time we cracked open a box of bisquick gluten free and made a batch of pancakes , i was surprised they were delicious ! perhaps the best pancakes i 've ever had we did make a couple modifications from the box recipe instead of using oil , we use the same amount of melted butter and we add fresh blueberries to each pancake as it 's cooking then , serve with whipped cream so great ! i'm looking forward to trying some of the other recipes with this , including pizza crust . 
i really like it when my wife makes anything from her betty crocker cookbook , so i know when we got the gluten free pancakes that they would be good they are not overly dry like some of the other brands of gluten free pancakes br br we usually have them with earth balance butter spread , and sliced bananas or sliced strawberries , chopped pecans or walnuts and maple syrup they are great . 
a few years ago , going gluten free was really difficult i missed the basic things i loved to eat and pancakes were certainly one of them i tried other mixes but the batters were very dry and required items to moisten them such as fruit , etc but bisquick 's gf pancake mix was surprisingly good ! it is a great alternative to the real thing certainly all of us gluten sensitives out there know it will never be that delicious stack of buttermilk pancakes like we once knew , but i'm happy to know there 's a great alternative \) . 
this replaces many of other brands of pizza crust mix , cake mix , foccaccia and more the only reason i do n't give it 5 stars is that it is slightly pricey , but that is an issue of living gluten free enjoy and be creative with it . 
as far as gluten free products this is awesome i use it as a substitute for any recipe that asks for flour it makes great pumpkin waffles . 
finally a gluten free pancake product ! pancakes not to bad , taste like regular bisquick the batter is just right , not too heavy pancakes this was a good price compared to local grocers . 
this is a very versital product ! ! ! ! love it my husband must eat gluten free and my kids prefer pancakes made with this ! . 
my son who has celiacs loves the pancakes you can make from these , and so do i and i will eat them , even though i do n't need to eat gf ! highly recommend ! . 
i have now served gluten free bisquick pancake and waffle mix to several of our friends and relatives i usually make waffles and have even done a taste test with regular bisquick and 5 people everyone liked gluten free best ! i am so happy that i can buy it on amazon as it is twice as much in the grocery stores thank you for carrying this great product br alice miller , modesto , ca . 
after searching many local stores to find this product i ordered it via amazon i took the advice of other reviewers ordered the 3 pack i 've only made pancakes w it , but they are delicious some complain that they are bland i always add a little something to flavor my pancakes a few drops of vanilla a sprinkle of cinnamon had these pancakes tasting wonderful ! my 2 yr old loved them i highly recommend you try the gf bisquick . 
i 've been gluten free for a little over a year and i 've struggled with finding tasty and affordable alternatives to my favorite foods the great thing about this mix is that it 's really easy to make , affordable , and the pancakes are so tasty , my children do not object to eating them saving me the time of making two batches of pancakes if they did n't see me eating them , i do n't even think my kids would notice that they are eating gluten free pancakes . 
wow it 's delicious ! br the kids love it ! br we made it for breakfast this morning the pancakes were eaten in no time at all ! br the only complaint was that there was n't more ! br \( actually , it was disappointing that the boxes were n't bigger \) . 
the first time i tried this product to make pancakes , i thought it was terrible i made it according to the directions and used the right measuring cups for liquid and dry ingredients , but found that the batter came out thin and the texture was gummy then , one day when i was visiting my mother , she decided to make pancakes , and since i am gf , she had bought this mix for me \( not knowing i had already hated it \) i saw that she measured the ingredients incorrectly as she used the same measuring cup \( generally used to measure liquids \) for both the dry and the liquid ingredients she also used a whisk to mix the ingredients amazingly enough , the pancakes came out fluffy , and i really liked it in fact , it is my favorite gluten free pancake mix so far having said that , both my husband and i are of the opinion that this product still has a bit of the gritty texture that is present in many gf products however , it is the best pancake mix that i have found so far . 
best bisquick pancakes i 've ever made ! i think these are better than the original bisquick pancakes my husband even loved these ! i would recommend buying this product ! . 
you wo n't find a better gluten free pancake mix out there as a matter of fact , i much prefer these gluten free pancakes to regular pancakes \( and i buy them for my husband \) i love bisquick for this product ! . 
when i found gf bisquik in the stores , i was happy when i found it on amazon with a good price as a subscription , i was thrilled our daughter lives in texas and is gluten intolerant so i mail her items on a regular basis this has become a staple in her kitchen anything you can make with regular bisquik you can adapt using this so now she makes cookies , pancakes and biscuits to her heart 's content taste and texture of items made with it are good . 
it makes good tasting gluten free food but like most gluten free food , it 's expensive and it 's got a slight grit to it i 've made biscuits , waffles , and pancakes with it a friend made some awesome banana bread with it it 's very good for gluten free . 
it 's great ! i actually used this to make gf donuts the other day i love how convenient it is it 's so hard being gluten free so this is god sent for how many things you can make with this i have celiacs and i have n't had any sort of negative reaction to this i would definitely recommend this for anyone who ca n't have gluten but still wants things like pancakes and waffles and donuts and other fun things . 
we use this mix for pancakes and waffles and it 's perfect we have had a terrible time finding a good all purpose flour that is gluten free \( the popular brands taste terrible ! \) so we tend to use this pancake mix as a base for a lot of our recipes including breading for baked chicken and other things it 's definitely best as a pancake mix of course , but using it as a starting point for baking has helped us find normal tasting gluten free baked foods \) . 
i recently went gluten free and this is one of my favorite mixes i used it for biscuits and pancakes and it 's very good you can also use it for pizza dough and to make fried chicken it 's about average for that . 
i could not believe how great this mix tasted it 's like eating the regular one it came out soooooo good , fluffy and delicious ! ! ! ! ! . 
i find it hard to express how pleased i was to find bisquick in a gluten free form i have tried countless recipes using mixtures of rice , and potato flour and none of them tasted good the bisquick bisquits are delicious , but unfortunatly i could n't make satisfactory dumplings with the mix . 
my son loves these pancakes much healthier alternative to the original i am excited to try the other recipes soon . 
if you only knew br br bisquick gluten free \( gf \) is by far one of the best options out there for people with celiac or sensitivity to gluten br i honestly do n't know how healthy it is for you what i do know it that it is a great option for people trying br to eat as normal as possible this gf option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed br with celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting gf options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals br br we have made all types of breakfast items , biscuits , even fried food \( chicken tenders , mozzarella sticks , fried fruit , \) we bout our own little frier br br http www amazon com dp b0016nq49q ref as li ss til \? tag talkinhome 20 camp 0 creative 0 linkcode as4 creativeasin b0016nq49q adid 0xk6hzpjrkaed855hewp br br in short , it has not only been a great option , but also has been quite tasty allowing my wife to make one meal for both of us not worrying that br it will taste bad to me br br hope this was helpful . 
i find it really hard to believe this is gf because it tastes better than any gf product i 've ever had i made waffles with it this morning and i did n't even want butter or syrup ! it was that amazing ! i want proof that this truly gf . 
this is a great product for us gluten free people we use it for everything from pancakes , waffles , to cookies , scones , cooking . 
so grateful for this ! ! what an amazing mix it can be used to make some of the best gluten free products out there what a break through for us gluten free individuals who miss real mixes some of the other ones on the market just dont do the trick like this does \) . 
i 've tried many gluten free products on the market and this is by far the easiest and more yummiest product yet ! ! thank you betty crocker ! ! ! . 
thank you thank you thank you i have an intolerance for gluten and bisquick is my hero i have tried some of those other packed product and invested in loads of ingredients to make my own mix but bisquick has saved me from myself again thank you thank you thank you . 
my children can not have wheat , gluten , soy , dairy , eggs it is very hard to find products that they can have we use this for pancakes , pizza crust , cakes basically we just use it in place of flour it is so nice to be able to buy bisquick in the grocery stores now however it is much cheaper through amazon ! . 
my husband is gluten intolerant and as with all gluten free products out there the results are not always the best he loves this product and since i only really make the pancakes i ca n't say how the other bisquick recipes would turn out for any of you and yes he has this texture and taste thing with gluten free products as well gritty , sandy or off tasting etc etc so i am happy he likes this one ! with gluten free products you really have to test them out one by one as some perform in the taste and texture area better than other blends my advice to anyone searching for gluten free products they want to try that it is best to buy them in the single packages , if possible i know on amazon they sell them in bulk but if you find that you do n't like it you are then stuck with alot of packages you no longer want ! just a tip for all of you out there it may cost more for one package but the waste will be much less unless you donate them to the local food bank good product and great results ! thank you , bisquick ! . 
i like the bisquick , it works great in a variety of uses wish it came in a bigger box , the recipes are good on the box though . 
neither myself nor my husband can have any type of corn products , but we love cornbread this mix makes biscuits that taste just like corn bread to us nice to find an alternative that tastes so great ! appreciate having this order size option as well since it 's often missing from grocery store shelves . 
i love this ! such a great product for all us gluten free folks ! it works the same as the regular bisquick their website has tons of gf recipes too ! this makes delicious pancakes and 'magic crust' pies yummy ! . 
this is great as a pancake mix it almost has a corn texture to it i rate everything by if my son will eat it he is super picky and loves the pancakes i tried making biscuits with the mix that did n't turn out very well but as far as pancakes it rocks . 
great taste , texture , flavor , and works well with any recipe ! wonderful pricing , too ! gluten free products are so expensive normally ! definitely recommend this ! . 
i received this item on time the packaging was great the gluten free bisquick is a great addition to our gluten free pantry . 
i first discovered gluten free biscuit in the supermarket i bought it and loved it i then tried to find it again in all the local supermarkets , but could not find it i called the manufacturer and they informed me that i could purchase it at amazon i was thrilled amazon is one of my favorite web sites . 
i had no idea there was a gluten free bisquick mix i made pancakes and they were great and the tea cakes also . 
bisquick has made a wonderful gluten free product from pancakes to biscuits and everything in between are light and fluffy ! garlic and cheddar or cinnamon and sugar is a great addition . 
in trying to eat a little healthier i'm reducing my gluten intake \( gluten wheat may not be the best for arthritis inflammation \) so i gave this gluten free bisquick a try surprisingly , i was pretty impressed with the flavor which to me tastes almost as good as regular bisquick br br i followed a reviewer 's suggestion to let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after adding just the milk the batter looked better and was a nicer consistency after the resting time it was a little hard to get all the lumps out of the batter though and because i have limited gf experience i was n't sure whether further stirring would gum it up so i left some lumps in and they dissolved while cooking br br the texture of the cooked pancakes was very slightly gritty makes pancakes a little thinner than with regular bisquick however thick enough that i 'd say they are just right see photo added br br i used a cast iron griddle to make the pancakes , which made them barely crisp outside and nice tender inside very good ! ! ! br br the taste is close to regular bisquick but a little more plain i use real maple syrup and sometimes preserves and with either of the two toppings , i had a very good , very tasty short stack br br my only quibble is that this mix is a little pricey but i 'd rather buy this mix than other gf products i 've tried that are just as pricey and do n't taste nearly as good . 
i have this on auto ship because i use it so much i have gone to every grocery in az and the cheapest place is amazon ! this is a great product and whatever you make using this flour will taste great my son has celiac and is allergic to gluten i have tried every pancake mix and this one is the one i settled for ! . 
this is a product that is delicious and easy to use i made the pancakes with buttermilk and the recipe on the box just said milk the buttermilk helped make the pancakes light and fluffy i am a little disappointed that the box will only make one recipe that calls for two cups of the mix i doubled my recipe for the pancakes which made 14 br 4 inch pancakes the recipe says it makes 10 pancakes with 1 cup of the mix those 10 pancakes must be silver dollar size i am looking forward to making the biscuits so i will have to open a second box to have enough mix the recipe calls for eggs for biscuits and i never used eggs in my regular biscuits i am wondering if buttermilk would make these biscuits rise sufficiently \? i have family members who ca n't eat eggs or milk so i must adapt recipes for them it is a product i would purchase again however , i used subscribe and save on amazon and the time to receive the product was really long in my opinion ordered nov 19th received dec 2nd i know thanksgiving was in the midst of that time period but i thought i would have received the product before thanksgiving i will try subscribe save one more time to see if all things are so slow a href http www amazon com gp product b004391dk0 bisquick pancake and baking mix , gluten free , 16 ounce boxes \( pack of 3 \) a . 
these tasted so good ! i was surprised because i have heard so many negative things about glutten free bread products i would eat these by choice , not because i have to . 
we 've tried pamela 's \( second best \) , bob 's red mill and king arthur 's gluten free flour mixes for pancakes , waffles , breading , pie crusts , biscuits and dumplings , bisquick has been the most reliable performer we whole heartedly recommend it for those who bake at home but need to avoid gluten ! ! . 
i found this product in a local walmart , after trying vainly to find bread that i liked that is gluten free \( stay away from the ener g brand , in my opinion \) br br i have been gluten free for 3 weeks now , and seriously craving bread products i made some pancakes this morning from this product , and wow ! ! very tasty , very light , i needed to thin them a bit more to have them spread correctly , but , this was the first real carb product that was bread like that i have eaten in 3 weeks needless to say , i ate too many , and now have a carb headache ! \) br br seriously though , this product , used in moderation , may help you not miss your gluten products quite as much i look forward to making bisquits and some of the other recipes on the box br way to go on this product , it strikes a home run in the gluten free market . 
i made delicious banana pancakes last week using this product and over the weekend , remade a family favorite from years ago , chicken and dumplings , which was on the betty crocker website under gf we could n't tell the difference between the gf and regular mix in the dumpling results i made the recipe from scratch for six , using chicken breasts and thighs simmered till tender in chicken broth , baby carrots , celery , cut green beans , onion and seasonings and stirred up some white gravy to pour over the dish before serving husbie loved it . 
i use this to quickly make gluten egg dairy free pancakes i use rice milk and engerg egg replacer to make pancakes they taste pretty good and are a good snack to make for later and store in the fridge they 're especially good w either apple butter or peanut butter on them besides the usual maple syrup ! . 
this stuff is pretty solid makes a decent enough pancake for being gf and makes a solid biscuit as well what we have found works best is taking this mix and using it half and half with the chebe mix between the two it makes for a very nice flour mix the chebe is good but on its own tends to be a little squishy , but when you mix it with the bisquick , the bit of squishiness gives the dryer bisquick the fluffiness and moistness it needs so , i recommend this , but i would highly recommend getting some chebe too and cutting the bisquick with it also , even though this mix has leavening agents in it , when we use recipes that call for leavening agents we add them anyway , it tends to turn out better this way . 
i run a small bed and breakfast , and bought this product so i could prepare recipes for my guests that have a gluten allergy and they love it there are many recipes on the box , and even more on their website quick , easy , inexpensive , what more could anyone ask for . 
i have so many food allergies it 's ridiculous ! i am so happy that they made this product and that is available at a decent price i was able to expand my meal plans and make stuff i thought i could n't have anymore i made a pizza with my family all in town using this and then a pizza using a different crust and the whole family liked my bisquick crust better they said it was lighter and had more taste ! i really enjoy finding things that make my crazy diet easier to deal with thank you thank you thank you . 
love this product ! gluten free products have come a long way easy to use great for all your breakfast and baking needs ! . 
this product is great for pancakes for baked goods i blend bisquick \( 2 3 part \) with pamela 's bread mix \( 1 3 part \) for great gluten free dairy free treats the bread mix makes it less crumbly . 
this product has helped our friend to be able to eat again she is going to college and finding things to eat has been hard for her , we send her a supply every month so now she can make her own food and not get sick ! . 
you wo n't miss your old waffle pancake mix when using this wonderful product i mix it with oatmeal in most cases and it makes wonderful waffles pretty easy to give up gluten with this mix . 
due to health issues , my husband is newly required to eat a gluten free diet he acted as if he was on death row finding this product has help immensely i can make him pancakes with fresh fruit and he does n't feel he is being unfairly punished also , my neighbor was faced with a similar circumstance i shared one of the boxes with her and she is now a fan ! a href http www amazon com gp product b004391dk0 bisquick pancake and baking mix , gluten free , 16 ounce boxes \( pack of 3 \) a . 
i have only had this once as banana pancakes so i'm not sure how it tastes without fruit , but it was the best pancake i 've had in a long time thank you for making a gluten free bisquick , i will try biscuits with it next ! . 
we use gluten free bisquick to make coated baked chicken , waffles , pancakes , biscuits , chicken pot pie there are many recipes available to make quick easy meals we really like it everyone can eat it instead of just making a gluten free meal for the one person who is gluten free reasonably priced for gluten free . 
my daughter has been gf for about 4 years now we have discovered that if the main ingredient is rice flour , it usually is n't any good it is usually grainy this is n't the case with this product it makes fantastic pancakes \( the rest of the family would eat them \) she did n't like the biscuits so we wo n't make those again we used it to make corn dogs and the entire family \( and a friend \) ate them no one even noticed everyone loved them br br amazon has since taken this off of the subscribe and save i am so mad i hope they put it back on soon . 
i really love this product , i think it is a great overall flour replacement in your kitchen but i just felt the size was a bit small i would have really loved to see the box be larger , i think there are three cups total in the box overall the product is amazing though everything i 've made with it has come out wonderfully and all of the recipes online via bisquick 's website are easy to follow and come out very good i 'd highly recommend this product to anyone my favorite things to make are the biscuits , i add a little cheddar to them to make them oh so good and the apple pie which is more like a coffee cake but good either way ! give it a shot if you are gf ! . 
finally a great and easy gf option for pancakes , waffles , biscuits , etc from bisquick ! ! both of my kids have celiac and absolutley love this stuff wish the container was bigger but we 're just happy to have better tasting options for breakfast now thank you , thank you , thank you ca n't taste a difference , but the rest of the family uses the cheaper stuff . 
thanks to the betty crocker people for this gf option it makes great pancakes and shortcakes for strawberries too my onlycomplaint is i wish the box was bigger . 
i was so happy to find this product when it was first released ! i had used regular bisquick for years before being diagnosed with celiac disease this is just as versatile as the original pancakes , biscuits , dumplings , etc ! my family 's favorie is the pancakes , they are light and fluffy and have a lovely crispness to the outside br br my only reason for not awarding this 5 stars is the size of the box , it is small my family of 4 uses the entire box for saurday morning pancakes the box makes approximately 3 \( small \) batches of pancakes , we freeze the extra in single servings for weekday breakfasts i 'd love to see bisquick release a larger box but until then i 'll continue ordering the 3 pack ! a href http www amazon com gp product b004391dk0 bisquick pancake and baking mix , gluten free , 16 ounce boxes \( pack of 3 \) a . 
i really love this mix as the pancakes are so soft and fluffy could not tell that they were gluten free i also made carrot muffins with it and they turned out good . 
i grew up eating bisquik , so finding a gluten free version of the quintessential baking mix was wonderful however , a 16 ounce box only makes two batches of pancakes ! i would love it if the gf bisquik could be made in a box size like the conventional bisquik especially since my family eats up the pancakes this makes even more than the regular ones . 
due to my kid 's food allergies i had to substitute eggs with ground flax with water , and 2 cups instead of one of rice milk , and some olive oil made great tasty pancakes ! . 
i do a lot of from scratch gluten free cooking but there is nothing that can replace bisquick from the ease of morning pancakes to using it in other reciepes in place of other mixes there is simply nothing that i cannot do with this little box . 
i was really surprised when i tried this product because i found it to be a really light fluffy batter so do n't think gluten free means flavorless , this bisquick pancake mix will have you building up stacks of fluffy pancakes for your family it 's so nice that these are healthier for you , diabetic friendly and still manage to taste great too ! . 
this gluten free milk free product is awesome ! i am able to use almond milk in it instead of regular milk it is great to have such a delicious easy breakfast that does n't make my stomach hurt ! . 
i'm new to trying gf , and most of the 'substitution products' i 've tried so far are okay , but do n't taste quite 'right ' br this was the exception the pancakes i made with the gf bisquick were light and smooth and delicious ! i could n't tell a difference , unless maybe they were a bit better a larger box would be better , but the product itself is wonderful br highly recommended ! ! . 
we found out last week that my son has multiple allergies , including milk , soy , wheat , tree nuts , oranges , tomatoes , corn \( thus corn syrup and starch \) we are in the process of trying to find ways to make what he likes to eat and still avoid thsese ingredients br br does anyone have a list of all ingredients before i spend 10 on this product \? br thanks . 
gluten free goes mainstream with the addition of gluten free bisquick br general mills does a good job making the gluten free version of their famous brand ! br br are you gluten free \? do you know someone that is \? an estimated 12 50 million americans are affected by gluten , the protein found in wheat , barley and rye grains and most do not even know it gluten is a toxin for many , especially those with celiac disease , autism , diabetes , multiple sclerosis , crohn 's disease and a host of other gluten intolerant and gluten sensitivity issues br it is quite challenging for those following a gluten free diet to find and afford products that are gluten free wheat is one of the most prevalent ingredients in the american diet br find the best tasting gluten free foods at exclusively we have been serving the gluten free community for over 12 years . 
was very happy that the kids liked these ! we all liked them ! i bought this mostly for myself i made them with coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil that it calls for it was a yummy , healthy substitute will definitely be buying again . 
hubby had to switch to gluten free because of gluten intolerance so we tried this and made pancakes they were great and had sort of a corn bread texture to it fyi i made cobbler from an regular bisquick recipe \( not gluten free \) and the measurements do not transfer the proportions are different with the gluten free mix so make sure you have the right recipe for what you 're making . 
my family loves bisquick pancakes , my kids did not notice the difference from this product and regular pancakes the only problem is the price , i will try pamelas this week , price seems more reasonable . 
i am going gluten free to test if i am sensitive to it , it is a good diet to be on anyway br br this was very tasty in a pancake it was light and fluffy you do need to use a little more butter than usual but that makes it even better they fried up with uniform color and had a nice little brown edge letting me know they were done . 
it was worth the wait gluten free bisquick is just like the real thing ! ! everything tastes the way you remember it so make dumplings , pancakes or cheddar biscuits they are all as good as they can be ! . 
i have missed bisquick since i became gluten free and am so happy to see they have gone gluten free i 've only made pancakes so far , but they are wonderful . 
it was wonderful we made chicken nuggets it was light and coated the chicken very nicely br br i highly encourage you to purchase this taste pretty much like regular bisquick has many uses flour , gravy , pancakes excellent way to stretch your dollar . 
it tough to find good gluten free baking mixes but this one is smooth unlike some that are gritty , and makes just as easily as regular bisquick it tastes just as good too . 
i am so happy that bisquick came out with a gluten free version ! we 've tried so many other brands of pancake and waffle mix , and hands down , bisquick is the best ! we just made waffles this morning , and both my husband and i were floored at how good they were ! the outside was crisp and the inside was soft with that said , it 's not that great for pancakes or coffeecake . 
my mom 's impossible veggie pie was a staple in our house especially once i became a vegetarian as a teen as an adult i served it regularly to my family ten years ago when my celiac was diagnosed it was bye bye veggie pie i do try to eat less processed foods but i really did rejoice when i heard about the gf bisquick we had impossible broccoli pie last night for the first time in a decade and it was wonderful the mix is just as easy to use as the non gf alternative and produces the same results no crumbles ! how often do you see that in a gf product \? i bought a box at the grocer to test , then went directly to subscribe save here this will be a staple in my gf kitchen . 
i 've tried a few other mixes for pancakes , and they 've been awful , but this one is really good i should buy stock in the co , because people will be buying this product i'm sure . 
i made cheddar biscuits with this and they came out a little dry the first time , but i adjusted the recipe and they were amazing i just added a little more milk and another egg \( we have chickens that lay very small eggs , so 3 of our eggs is like 2 large store bought ones \) . 
this is an excellent product and i use it just like i used to utilize the regular bisquick product it works well with any recipe that calls for flour and quickening . 
this is a blessing to those of us who are gf there are so many things we can make again now that we have bisquick ! not to mention that pancakes finally taste like pancakes again ! how nice to be able to have a biscuit with dinner again ! since gf products are so expensive the best place to get it is at amazon on the automatic shipment plan it 's great ! . 
as tasty as the regular \( gluten \) product only drawback is that you do n't get a lot of mix for your money half of the box is needed to make their 12 pancake recipe on a good note , it 's nice to have options by far though , this was the best pancake mix i 've tried and i tried a lot ! . 
this makes the best waffles that i have had in years i will be glad to see more in grocery stores in our area . 
a great way to make cheese biscuits for the celiac i serve to guests and they cannot believe that my celeiac husband can eat them as they are sooooo good ! ! ! who says gluten free has to taste bad ! ! ! . 
\( i'm the member of my family who needs to avoid wheat products \) br i like this even more than the regular bisquick mix , when i make pancakes br its taste is closer to that of my from scratch wheat flour pancakes br other members of my family have not tried it , yet , and i have n't used it in a pizza crust or biscuits . 
we love the new gluten free bisquick ! i used to for cheddar biscuits mostly until we found out that we had a milk protein intolerance now , we are using this to make so many more recipes because it is dairy free and from what i can tell allergen free the only thing i would like better \( general mills if you are listening i know i am not the only one that wants this \) is if it came in bulk packaging just put the gf bisquick in a larger box like the regular bisquick and then sell in a 3 or 6 pack just mark that this review was helpful if you agree and maybe gm will listen ! love this order now ! ! . 
i usually make my own gluten free stuff from scratch and i love it , but the days when i feel lazy i feel like using a mix , and this one has to be the best one yet their mix tastes closely like the real \( wheat \) thing i have made the pancakes , waffles , oven baked chicken , and strawberry shortcakes absolutely delicious . 
our family has been wheat free for 3 years and gluten free for 1 1 2 so we 've tried just about every mix out there i just found that bisquick has a gf mix while in the grocery store and decided to give it a try this is definitely the best mix that we have ever tasted smooth , not grainy i do n't know that side by side with regular wheat pancakes that you would notice the difference ! . 
this is one of the most versatile mixes i 've found , and most recipes come out tasting very much like the full of gluten blends i , like many , am struggling with celiac 's disease , and i 've only just found out i have it , so i'm not quite sure what to buy , what 's healthy , and what does n't taste like cardboard br br gluten free is a way of life you have to adjust to in almost every way , from giving up many favorites , to training your pallet to love these new found grains br br bisquick is rice based , and is very much like it 's original version , however be aware that the pancakes will be a little less fluffy and that you should follow the recipe to the t when it comes to these betty crocker has a recipe website they 've published for you using this product that has quite a few tasty treats you 'll love when it calls for vegetable shortening , be sure to use it , for example , biscuits made without shortening , and only butter will be very dry and not very satisfying , even difficult to swallow use recipes that include shortening , and will result in moist , fluffy foods and breads will help you end up with an enjoyable addition to your meal br br fun and tasty gluten free recipes for this mix can be found on the betty crocker website , they wo n't allow me to post the link here , sorry br br update fun tip about this and other gluten free mixes , my mom figured out that when you 're mixing together your ingredients and you 're using one that calls for milk , that if you mix together only the base mix and the milk and let it set for about 15 minutes before continuing with your recipe and adding other ingredients , the end result is much fluffier and tastier this would be much like making tapioca pudding , you have to let the milk and tapioca soak to 'activate the tapioca' before moving on , so i think that type of reaction is what 's happening here with the bisquick mix yay for mom ! br br hope that helps you with your purchasing decision br thanks for reading ! . 
i have been gf for the past year and have tried all sorts of flour alternatives this one is certainly the best , and the best part about it , is you can substitute it for any creation that calls for original bisquick the best so far is the waffles that you can make following the directions on the back i will be ordering again ! ! my only complaint is that the boxes are small compared to the other boxes of bisquick available on the shelves . 
this is excellent this is the best gf mix i 've yet to try in over five years of trying it all it 's not grainy , none of that rice grainy thing going on at all the texture of everything i 've used it for has been excellent this is a winner the price is a bummer , but the product is amazing . 
i bought this product uncertain that it would be worth the money , and quickly came to love it i made gf biscuits and gravy for my family and we did n't mention that it was all gluten free everyone loved the biscuits they did n't fall apart at all like a lot of other brands do i used butter flavored shortening and i think it made the biscuits even more delicious if you have n't tried it yet , try it now i now buy a box a week amazon has a much better price than i can find in most stores in vegas . 
the best gluten free mix i 've tried of the recipes on the box i can vouch for the pancakes and the waffles the biscuits were edible if not enjoyable the pancakes and waffles also freeze well i also recommend betty crocker 's glutenfree recipe collection magazine for extra recipes to try with or without this mix from the magazine i have thus far made the chicken and dumplings \( the dumplings disintegrate a bit too easily but are still good \) and the fruit swirl coffee cake \( i used a full can of pie filling per 8x8 i used apple and lemon pie fillings i thought the cake tasted rather like a cobbler or dry danish pastry \) the mix is quick , it 's easy , it tastes good , and it is versatile and hey although the packaging of the mix into the little boxes is a bit of a pain it does serve to keep the mix fresh ! . 
my daughter was diagnosed with celiac about 2 years ago , and has gone without pancakes ever since until i happened to come across this at the grocery store really was n't expecting good results but it 's very good ! the non celiac members of the family even prefer the gf version to the regular ! try it ! . 
we 've tried so many gluten free products and this one was by far the best i 've made pancakes , waffles , biscuits and the chicken recipe for the whole family with this and they can not tell the difference pamela 's is a good mix too but this one is much better it is expensive but when you 've got a loved one who is gluten intolerant you 're just thankful to have options for them i can find it at some of my grocery stores but not all you just have to check and see who carries it and then try a box it 's worth it ! . 
i have been using g f products for the past 4 years and it is good to see more main stream companies getting the religion the product works , the pancakes and waffles have come out beautifully . 
we cant say enought about the gluten free bisquick my husband and all three kids are allergic to wheat and we are on a strick gluten free diet in our house i have tried every product out there to make pancakes , waffles , biscuits and even chicken fingers and was so pleasantly suprised that this little box does it all and does it all wonderful pancakes are wonderful , waffles are great , chicken fingers are the best ive made and the biscuits are delish cant ask for anything better i only wish you could buy it ina bigger box and it was a little cheaper but we are a huge fan . 
i love this i have celiac , so this was the first time i had pancakes i loved them , so did the rest of the family \( they can eat wheat \) . 
this bisquick gluten free mix is amazing i have n't had a biscuit or banana bread in over a year and now i just ca n't stop making things br i just made banana bread \( for the 3rd time with this mix \) and my family loves it i use it for everything , i am so pleased i made a cherry pie , cheddar biscuits i 've been br using my old bisquick recipes from ages ago and it is working fine i am so thankful for amazon and their items i sure keep the ups guy br busy . 
i love this bisquick mix ! over the past 10 years , since being diagnosed wheat gluten intolerant , i have tried so many gluten free mixes that were so bad i ended up feeling like i might as well be eating the box ! this bisquick mix is by far the best i have found for making scones \( plain or sweet \) and biscuits ! the orange biscuits , cheddar biscuits and raisin scones i have made were delicious it was easy to substitute this mix into my old recipes , because unlike some gluten free mixes , i found i can play around with this and do n't have to measure everything absolutely precisely to get a good outcome of course , you ca n't roll this dough out like traditional dough , it has to be dropped onto the baking sheet in spoonfuls i have found that if i do n't make it too sticky , i can gently form the balls in my hands to give a more regular shape to my scones and biscuits i have also used it for making deep dish chicken pie and pizza \( be sure you press it nice and thin in the pan i use a silicone spatula to press it so that it does n't stick \) bisquick mix is made by the betty crocker company and this , along with the betty crocker cakes and brownie mixes , allows me to indulge in delicious baked goods again ! i have bisquick mix on subscribe and save , which makes it very affordable and makes sure that i do n't ever run out ! . 
i absolutely love this product being able to have pancakes was my original goal however i made the pizza with it was absolutely thrilled about the pizza br these are small boxes \( makes two pizzas per box \) , but i would highly recommend i am reordering a pack of three now ! . 
wow ! thank you bisquick for coming up with a gluten free product i tried it and it works wonderfully so far i have used ot for waffles \( recipe on the box \) which were excellent and a baked chicken and spike recipe which was also wonderful anyone needing gluten free products will like this . 
after my husband 's enthusiastic reaction to the glutin free bisquick biscuits , i rediscovered an old bisquick recipe booklet and used its recipe to make an impossible cherry pie he loved it ! next i 'll try the impossible pecan pie this is the first gluten free product that my husband really likes i will buy again although i 'd like to find it packaged sold less expensively than on amazon . 
i like the ease of this mix i have n't tried anything but pancakes they were great ! i did add cottage cheese to my mix to add protein , which made them less fluffy but not less tasty i ca n't wait to try this mix for chicken i really miss fried chicken . 
can as be used to make cookies even egg free ! i just used the mix , enough apple sauce to make a batter , some coconut butter and added vanilla and cinnamon and baked turned out soft delicious cookies with only 5 minutes from box to the oven however , even wallmart carries this for about one dollar per box less than here . 
this is really a great product works and tastes just like the gluten product our son is a celiac and we have tried a lot of products we rate this crossover brand one of the best . 
it was recently suggested to me i try going gluten free to battle an autoimmune thyroid disorder i bought the gluten free bisquick hoping the pancakes would at least be edible the bisquick has far exceeded my expectations ! the pancakes are light , fluffy , and delicious ! i definitely recommend this product ! . 
i was so excited when bisquick came out with the gluten free version , but i was frustrated with the length of time it took for me to get a hold of some i did finally order some through amazon , and today i made pancakes using the mix due a milk allergy , i made them with soy milk \( the original 'flavor' \) and i added a little double strength vanilla they were fantastic and my family and guests gobbled them up i will definitely make them again and try some of the other recipes a href http www amazon com gp product b004391dk0 bisquick pancake and baking mix , gluten free , 16 ounce boxes \( pack of 3 \) a . 
we just bought this the other day because for about 2 years we have found that biscuits are a very hard wheat gluten free item to make i love it ! ! ! i even went further and put holes in the middle of the biscuit dough , flattened them a bit and then fried them in a bit of oil , sprinkled with sugar and had doughnuts ! my 3 year old feels like he is getting a treat ! . 
not gritty like a lot of gf mixes i make the whole box at once and keep them in the fridge , pop 'em in the toaster oven in the morning . 
i wish some of these companies would say whether the rice is white or brown rice i try very hard to just eat the whole grain version of any grain as they are more nutrient dense \( plus lower glycemic \) i 've not tried this yet , but if it was listed as brown rice flour , i would have put it in my cart . 
just in case you do n't know these are about 4 a box at the store , so anything more than 12 for a 3 pack is not worth it this is a great product , though \( that 's what the 4 stars are for \) the pancakes pizza dough are great , i make them all the time . 
this product is so useful in managing a gluten free diet ! the inced price amazon com makes it all a great buy . 
in the summer my doctor suspected i had a gluten sensitivity she wanted me to start making changes from packaged food and think about cutting out gluten after a bad few months i did some research and found this bisquick i have only made one thing so far , garlic cheese biscuits they were very tasty and had no strange texture or flavor they had a more spongey texture than a crumbly biscuits but i was halving the recipe so maybe that was why i nibbled on a biscuit hours out of the oven and it was still as soft and tasty i ca n't wait to try pancakes and coffee cake the only draw back is how small the box is for the price ! i will limit the use to once a week or so for a treat ! . 
this is one of the best gluten free mix on the market ! ! ! it makes fluffy pancakes and light cornbread also it is a great price ! i have had different mixes on the market in all price ranges and this is the best ! ! ! . 
i used the bisquick pancake and baking gf mix to make snickerdoodle cookies they were very good and stayed fresh for some time thank you for offering this mix . 
i purchased this while out of town we used it a couple of times , but never for biscuits i did make pancakes out of it and they were pretty good always use milk and butter br br they are a bit heavy and have a slight slimy sense to them , but are significantly better than a lot of stuff out there i did also use it to thicken some gravy and it was fabulous for that i used it for breading for chicken nuggets as well and it was good i would like to try this again for pancakes , and make some biscuits before i make a final decision on it . 
our family has tried just about every gluten free pancake mix on the market bisquick is one of the best ! two members of our family have celiac disease and three of us do n't , but we all love this mix for our tradition of saturday morning pancakes the only other gluten free pancake mix we like even better is a href http www amazon com gp product b005xp3r4i nuffins gluten free pancake mix case of 6 a it 's not always available on amazon , but when it is we try to stock up nuffins is definitely worth trying ! their other products are great too otherwise it 's bisquick or pamelas for our family br br the only con i can think of is the price at 5 00 per pound , this mix is expensive if you agree , mark this review as helpful ! maybe the good folks at betty crocker will take notice . 
i bought this on a whim because i was craving strawberry shortcake wow ! the biscuits can be a bit crumbly , but the texture is not objectionable the taste was great ! i use this for sweet and regular biscuits br br we also use this for pancakes , and they are almost indistinguishable from regular pancakes i add vanilla , a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon for a treat yum ! br br tip i 've found that most gluten free bread products work better if you let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after mixing the dry and wet ingredients it seems to activate the batter , which makes the resulting stuff lighter and more moist . 
i have used bisquick forever and now that i have celiacs i use the gf bisquick and i love it ! there is little to no difference at all between the two i have made biscuits , pot pie and pancakes and they are all awesome i find most all other brands have an after taste and bisquick does n't even my daughter who does not have a problem with gluten loves it and thinks its better than regular bisquick and she is only 5 i will buy this product all the time its my 1 baking mix \) . 
when i first found out that my 4 year old i had to go gluten free i was a little worried about how she would handle it gf bisquick has made it a lot easier i have been able to make her favorite foods such as chicken fingers , corn dogs , pizza and chinese \( sweet and sour chicken \) with this mix pancakes are also a big hit in our house they have quick and easy recipes on the box for the chinese i take their chicken finger recipe and cute the pieces of chicken into bite size pieces , and bake according to the recipe cook up some rice and just use a gf sweet and sour sauce a quick simple easy meal that tastes wonderful ! . 
this mix is great for biscuits , snicker doodles and homemade chicken nuggets but in our house that is all we have been gfree for 3 years and yes , i have a house hold with a husband and kids and we make a lot of gf stuff for everyone we love the pamela 's baking mix for pancakes waffles and sweetbreads and their flour blend the ultimate best out of them all for bread and as a sub for regular wheat flour recipes but i will buy this mix \( and yes , i do agree it is awfully expensive \) for those three things i 've mentioned and in a gf household , usually you find that having a few different blends for different products is just the best thing to do for the best taste not one flour does the best with everything . 
i have been gf for 2years i used this product for biscuits and liked them but were a little dry as for the pancakes , i prefer another product the pricing is outrageous i am single but cannot imagine trying to justify this cost when making pancakes for a family i love the betty crocker gf cake mixes and brownies though i still make my biscuits and oven baked chicken using this product it is getting more difficult to find on store shelves so most times i order here i have several bc cookbooks and have used the gf version bisquick as substitute for the regular bisquick some come out ok while others are not too good i am learning to vary ingredients to achieve better results my best experiment with this product was my scratch cornbread i use gf corn meal and this mix to make a delicious bread thank you bc for this product work on the pricing i would use it more often if i could afford it tired of manufacturers holding gf people hostage because it seems to be the latest diet craze gf people have to have these products to live br br going gf saved my life and bc now makes products so i can enjoy baked goods again i make my own breads using other products and now biscuits , cakes , cookies with this and other bc gf products i also use this product when recipes call for small amounts of regular flour it depends on what i am making br br as i am reviewing the product i gave it 5 stars i give the pricing 2 stars . 
this product produces excellent \( outstanding \) belgian waffles in my waring pro waffle iron they exceed anything you may buy in a restaurant truly ! however , at 5 per box , the cost of the other ingredients you must add , time to prepare , and the small amount of product in the box , i suggest you look at other gluten free products from pamela 's , the gluten free pantry , bob 's red mill , or arrowhead mills you may see a better value for your food dollars incidentally , arrowhead mills products are equally as tasty and easy to prepare , but i believe you are getting more product in the bag feeding a family of 4 would be a crap shoot at best with a single box of this product br br if the manufacturer were to repackage the product with more content per box and drop the price , i would have given it 5 stars safeway was the first store in san francisco to offer this product and placed it in the center of its baking products now , however , it has fallen to lowest shelf level with some prices sold by higher end grocers approaching 6 per box forget it at those prices hey , it 's largely ultra fine white rice flour and super fine sugar ! br br bisquick would also benefit from a buckwheat gf product in its inventory i would certainly buy it . 
ok i just bought bisquick gf and the first thing i tried to make were the drop biscuits \( recipe listed on the box \) these are not the kind that are rolled out cut these are drop biscuits the results were very tasty the taste of this gf bisquick is very much like the original , but the taste is not as tart as the original if you want a similar buttermilk taste , you will need to use buttermilk instead of milk in the biscuit recipe i noticed something else that was odd and might be a problem for anyone new to cooking it seems that the amount of mix called for is not quite right i read the side of the box and it claims that there are 3 2 3 cups of mix in the box \( 11 servings of 1 3 cup each \) the biscuit recipe called for 2 cups of mix i measured heaping teaspoonfuls into a measuring cup and i do n't even have a cup of mix left in the bag \? \? \? \? \? i know this mix does n't have wheat flour and maybe that kind of flour measures differently , maybe if i dug into the bag with a cup , i would have used less , but the recipe came out right so , there must be a misprint on the box i am assuming i measured properly because i have biscuits that can be dipped in gravy , smothered with butter jam , or sliced to make those yummy mcdonald 's breakfast sandwiches by following the instructions , i have a lot of biscuits if you are single , or just cooking for two you might want to cut the recipe in half you will still have plenty and you wo n't go through the box so quickly this mix cost me around 5 00 and i do n't have enough left to make anything else , without buying another box which i will because these biscuits are really , really good still , if you are watching your budget , do n't prepare more than you need br br about these biscuits yummy , fairly golden \( because the recipe calls for eggs \) , and they can be sliced with some crumbly edges , just like glutenous ones without the eggs , you probably wo n't get the nice eye appealing color even though they are drop biscuits , you still have to cut in shortening or margarine if you do n't have a cutter , you will need to use a long fork that is more difficult , so if you are a celiac that has been craving biscuits buy a cutter it will cost you as much as a box of this mix the biscuit recipe also calls for milk , so if you want that nice tart taste that is reminiscent of the original bisquick you will need to use buttermilk br br the mix is made up of rice flour , sugar , leavening , potato starch , salt , xanthum gum many mixes and goodies made with rice flour taste grainy bisquick has done a fantastic job with the rice flour it is not grainy at all i repeat , it is not grainy at all for those of you new to celiac cooking using a starch such as corn , potato , or tapioca is normal and adds a lightness to the baked item that would n't be possible with rice flour alone leavening is simply baking soda or powder and is necessary for rising the sugar and salt are for flavor and consistency , and yes , they are necessary as for the xanthum gum it is a perfectly natural ingredient and it gives celiac safe baked goods a bit of elasticity \( acting as a replacement for the gluten \) you will find xanthum gum in just about every baked goodie made for people with celiac disease can you just make your own mix and spend less money \? sure , but you will have a very difficult time finding rice flour as finely ground as the rice flour that is the predominant and main ingredient in this mix br br the other recipes listed on the box are for pancakes , waffles , strawberry shortcakes , pizza crust , ultimate chicken fingers , and oven baked chicken you can find more recipes on their website br br i recommend this product for the taste i do wish that more mix was in the box , for the price . 
love this mix for pancakes ! br many gf products have other ingredients i'm allergic to , so finding something that tastes great and is convenient is pretty exciting i make a batch of pancakes and freeze individual servings to microwave later br just had the yummy cheeseburger pie for dinner last night , recipes can be found on bettycrocker com . 
it is very nice to be able to have biscuits again i can only say they need to make a bigger box we run out way to fast . 
love this ! it 's so good and makes perfect pancakes love that it 's also dairy free my husband , who does not have gluten intolerance like i do , likes them as well hard to tell a difference between this and the gluten y version br br i love companies that make gluten free versions of their foods ! . 
we have tried a lot of different gf mixes and when i found this new mix from bisquick , i decided to try it i made waffles for my family and even my kids could n't tell they were gf they almost taster better than my original wheat recipe no strange texture or after taste . 
i ca n't say that biscuits made from this mix taste as good as the regular wheat but that said , for those of us needing gluten free foods , it 's not bad either . 
i just recently had to go gluten free and have been disappointed by the gluten free flours and baking mixes i bought this and it 's amazing ! just like the original bisquick although it is cheaper at walmart . 
when i discovered my sensitivity to gluten about 6 months ago , i was dismayed by most of the horrible gluten free foods on the market i have since found some substitute foods that are acceptable to me bisquick gluten free pancake and baking mix is one of them i use it every sunday to make either pancakes or waffles i recommend this mix whole heartedly ! . 
the absolute best baking product of its kind i have tried almost all gluten free baking products and bisquick gluten free is by far the best ! ! ! a little expensive but worth the money ! ! ! ! ! . 
for those with gluten allergies , this is great the shortcakes , biscuits , pancakes taste much the same as with the regular bisquick my only problem with it is that it comes in such a small size would love for them to box it in larger sizes . 
this is a healthy alternative to regular bisquick and works great in any biscuit mix recipe i will surely buy it again . 
was on gf diet for about 6 months used this new product from this old quality company with excellent results still use it for variety br a box goes a long way a little expensive but worth it . 
this is a great product perfect for the celiac searching for biscuit mix or pancake mix that actually tastes good also great topping for chicken pot pie . 
this product is beyond amazing ! i have been cooking pancakes in assorted ways for four decades and , for home use , no other product comes close to this bisquick gluten free mix it is superior not only to every gluten free product on the matter it is also superior to every other mix \( gluten free or not \) on the market friends and family are constantly amazed and surprised when i serve them breakfast so , to everyone and anyone , do n't make the mistake of associating this bisquick product w other gluten free products that result in food that tastes like cardboard br last thought thanks to amazon for making it available as a subscription purchase , since i can no longer find it in any south florida supermarkets . 
this stuff makes great pancakes and shortcake that i am actually allowed to eat ! br my doctor tells me i'm celiac this was three years ago now i just hope i can continue to find this bisquick ! . 
these are really good i like to make them with a little extra milk so that they are thin i ca n't even tell the difference between this and regular pancakes it 's worth the price for my family . 
we 've been using pamela 's for making pancakes and waffles , but i saw bisquick and grabbed a box to try it it made the absolute best waffles we 'd ever had gluten free or not ! pamela 's has you separate the egg yolk from the egg white and made making our saturday morning waffles tedious i added two packets of splenda to bisquick 's batter and everyone \( including my super picky kid \) came back for seconds i was a little worried because the batter seemed a bit gritty , but they baked up very smooth and fluffy my husband made fried chicken from the mix as well we did n't have any left overs of that , either br br way to go , bisquick ! . 
i love that it is mainstream and that it works like bisquick not all recipes work the same as regular bisquick though so i wish they had more recipes available it does taste more gluten free than some other options out there . 
1 cup gf bisquick br 1 cup soy or almond milk br 3 4 cup sugar br cinnamon to taste br br pour over your favorite fruit and bake for for a quick delicious cobbler br br gluten free bisquick is n't quite as fluffy and crumbly as the original but it is definitely worth it for the gf crowd . 
love these ! pancakes were something i missed the most after going on a gluten free diet 8 years ago , until now these are fantastic ! \) thank you for making them i love amazon mom 's because i get these shipped monthly thank you ! . 
i find the gluten free bisquick pancake mix to be just as easy to use as the original bisquick , and i like the flavor just fine \( not much different than regular bisquick \) it 's easy to make the pancakes , just add milk , oil , an egg , mix , and pour on the griddle cooking time seems to be about the same , and the consistency of the pancakes is just like regular pancakes i would definitely recommend this mix to anyone needing gluten free products . 
i was able to use this gluten free product and make it taste better than any restaurant by bringing the buttermilk to room temperature and separating the yokes from the whites and adding additional baking powder and baking soda to the recipe i love it served with pure maple syrup brings it out of this world . 
my 18 year old son cannot tolerate gluten , so i have been on a quest to find a pancake biscuit mix for him that he will actually like i tried a few others and they were horrible i felt so bad for my son and kept looking thank goodness i found bisquick it tastes most like real pancake mix and my son really enjoys it i have made him biscuits too and he is thrilled to eat bread again i highly recommend this mix for anyone who simply cannot eat wheat . 
i have been on gf diet for a month and it 's hard to find food that taste good or even close to what i used to eat but when my husband found bisquick gluten free at the store , the issue of what to eat for breakfast never came up actually my husband eats the gf pancakes wnow even if he does n't need a gluten free diet the pancakes are lighter and very tasty just follow the box directions . 
this product is a must have for celiacs ! the garlic biscuits and pizza crusts you can make are amazing ! ! . 
product has similar taste of wheat pancakes without the gluten even other family members not on gluten free diet like it . 
made really great biscuits even my non gf husband enjoyed them ! my only complaint would be that the packages are n't very big i used 2 cups to make a batch of biscuits and i do n't think there 's even 1 cup left in the package . 
after finding out i had a sensitivity to wheat , i searched for alternatives i decided to try this mix and make some biscuits wow , were they good ! they sort of reminded me of challah with a slight eggy flavor they came out more like sandwich rolls \( rather than flaky biscuits \) but not quite as big i'm thinking of making them super size next time so i can slice them in half and use for my lunches after eating corn tortillas every day , i'm glad i found something else i can have i also made an oven pancake with the mix and that was very good too i highly recommend it . 
i tried this today with a recipe from my bisquik cookbook for a chocolate chip cookie recipe they came out great ! my son who has autism and food sensory issues came back for seconds my 16 year old daughter stated they tasted like regular cookies the recipe was easy but took my whole box of mix they stayed puffy as i like my cookies that way anyway i experimented with one tray and refrigerated it it did not matter other than taking another couple minutes of baking will definitely buy this mix again . 
nothing gritty and second rate here ! they are just as good and the only pancake mix we use for the whole family , gluten free or not ! they are that good ! ! . 
i 've never made gluten free items before and i got great reviews from customers for my gluten free coffee cake . 
so being gluten free is hard , especially in a dorm but i have gotten really good at making gluten free pancakes on an electric frying pan they are super yummy ! i also make these really yummy cheesy garlic biscuits this stuff is heaven sent ! makes food that is reminiscent of normal food . 
i love this product ! after ten years of doing without , the pancakes and waffles from this product are fantastic ! i , too , wish it was packaged in a larger box , but as it is , i do n't mind devoting more shelf space to several boxes . 
we have been living gluten free for 5 years now , and this mix is the best i have found ! it makes great waffles . 
it is hard finding similar products for our gluten free child , for things she loved before being diagnosed with celiac disease this is a mix that she loves for pancakes she even made sweet potato biscuits yesterday with it we have found it on sale for 1 79 per box at our local grocery store \( less than amazon a few times , \) so we stock up when it is on sale it will be nice when gluten free foods are priced more closely to the wheat mixes i would recommend this for you we will try many more recipies using this product in the future a href http www amazon com gp product b004391dk0 bisquick pancake and baking mix , gluten free , 16 ounce boxes \( pack of 3 \) a . 
my daughter that is 16 and allergic to wheat refuses to follow the diet until i bought this now i make her waffles and freeze them every few days i usually get 7 8 waffles out of a box they are excellent . 
we use gluten free bisquick for many different things biscuits , pancakes , etc tastes good lets us serve our kids that are gluten free the same thing as the whole family . 
i just recently bought gluten free bisquick for the first time it has been wonderful i have to admit that i am addicted to their pancakes they are so light and thick and fluffy \( unlike homemade gluten free pancakes \) they are absolutely delicious ! . 
this product made wonderful pancakes i could n't taste the difference between this gluten free version and the original i tried using it to make pizza dough to relative success the texture was a little bit weird but it tasted good ! . 
i was happily surprised with this product i read other negative reviews and was honestly disappointed in betty crocker gf cake mix so i did n't feel the need to try this i finally bought it at a whim when i saw it at my local market and i am happy i did i am a baker at heart and love to spoil my family with homemade deserts and pancakes on the weekends i have adjusted my cooking and baking to primarily gf for the past year now and am happy when i find a gf alternative that cooks tastes like the real thing another plus is that i can buy this at my local market \( which does not carry too many specialty foods \) and do n't have to make the extra trip to the higher end store br br i made pancakes today and they were a hit with everyone will definitely use it to try other recipes br only downside is the cost and size of box very pricey and very small . 
this mix made tasty , crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron , but the whole box only made 3 5 waffles this would be a five star product for me if i could get more than one family meal out of it for the price . 
i 've been gluten free for 12 years now , have tried many bread mixes , and i love this one so does my husband , who is not gluten free i hope that everyone supports these bisquick products , since big brand gluten free bread and pasta products are so rare , and so rarely good it was something special for me when these came out \( if you can imagine waiting a decade for this , you 'll understand \) if those of us with celiac disease gluten intolerance keep enjoying them , maybe the price will come down \( though it 's not bad now \) and they will offer bulk deals it will also wake up other manufacturers i would happily order a case or much larger package i can make my own bread , but i prefer to use a mix , and use my cooking time for main dishes so do n't hesitate to try it , i ca n't imagine being disappointed by this product however , i do find it for less at my local grocery store . 
extremely happy with bisquick gluten free ! i had no idea what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised i always preferred bisquick pancakes over other popular brands through the years i am happy to say that i can eat my favorite brand of pancakes again without any health repercussions \( gluten intolerant \) my next objective is to make the roll recipe on the box i wish all manufacturers would take note of the rising gluten problem in this country ! . 
this mix makes the most delicious pancakes ! my gluten eating family wanted mine instead of theirs ! i have also make sausage balls and biscuits for biscuits and gravy with it ! so good ! . 
i was amazed to find this on the shelf of my favorite grocer \( sorry to say , cheaper than it is sold here , even with subscribe and save \) first thing i made was my childhood favorite dumplings and they were just like i remembered them to be ! the whole family was happy with them they were such a big hit ! i ca n't wait to make blueberry muffins this summer i have never been able to duplicate the taste of bisquick with any other gf recipe , and no other recipe for blueberry muffins is quite the same , in my opinion br br thank you , general mills ! . 
like the title says , i have tried \( nearly \) all the brands , spent a lot of money , and in the end these are the best gluten free pancakes i 've had br br i am not happy about the lack of fiber , and the the starchy flours used but a handful of ground flax seed makes up for that br br i am also happy about a brand that helps you to make biscuits and other things from the same mix other companies sell biscuits and pizza dough as a separate item , duping the customer to spend even more money br br compared to the many other brands , these do not have a funny taste or smell from odd flours these are made mostly from rice and potato flours you just feel normal br br i hope they will come out with a whole grain version from brown rice and bean flour br br tip to get the fluffiest texture use butter instead of oil room temperature butter . 
i am a bisquick biscuit lover from way back , and i thought the biscuits made per the recipe were a little blah , but i think they would be perfect using butter or margarine in place of shortening , so i have hope as far as the cobbler goes , i made a triple berry using the shortcake recipe on the back \( which calls for butter rather than shortening \) as the crust it was amazing br if you are expecting the ease of regular bisquick , forget it this is not a just add milk and stir kind of product the biscuits require the addition of egg , shortening \( cutting it in , but it is easy and not too messy to mix with your fingers \) , and milk also wish there was more in the box most of the recipes on the back require the use of the whole box . 
i was so excited to see gluten free bisquick my grandmother and mother both used it i fondly remember their strawberry shortcake , so that was the first thing i made i almost cried , it was so good i have since made the pancakes \( yum yum \) and baked chicken i'm a regular at their web site , liveglutenfreely com for its great recipes thank you , bisquick ! . 
i like this product , and will order it online again since it is a much better price than the grocery store i wish the box was a bit bigger , but it will do it is plain , but it makes a light and fluffy pancake you can add flavor with vanilla extract , cinamon , or blueberries i liked the texture of the biscuit recipe , but it came out more like a muffin i'm going to make it in a muffin pan next time and put cranberries in it i made my biscuits with butter if you are creative with the use of add ins , i think it would make good quickbreads , but not the rising type . 
my son just started the gluten free diet and i have tried some foods out there just seeing what he will eat he loved it , i could n't believe it at first but he kept eating i'm really glad that i was able to find something that he loves to eat for breakfast my little girl has starring to eat it to and she says it taste good i buy it every time i run out cause i love eating it too . 
i have always trusted the bisquick name , so i decided to buy this product i was thrilled with the pancakes and muffins i was able to make the only thing i have a problem with is the size of the box it 's very small like most gf product , you pay much more than you would for the non gf counterpart \( . 
thank goodness bisquick finally went gluten free ! i have been 3 years diagnosed with celiac , and besides pillsbury rolls , pancakes have been few and far between as have good biscuits ! we have eaten many pancakes since this product came out way to go betty crocker ! only negative is that this is actually cheaper in my local stores . 
my wife and daughter are celiac but my son and i are not we have been using bob 's red mill gf pancake mix and it 's pretty good but you can tell it 's gluten free the pancakes we made today with this bisquick mix were amazing my mother , my son , and i could barely tell them from the normal wheat version on flavor the texture is a bit different but they 're light and fluffy unlike a lot of overly dense gf versions we 'll definitely be stocking up on this and using it with some of the old stand by regular bisquick recipes to see how it works in them . 
this is a great product ! hats off to betty crocker once again they are becoming a more main stream go to company for people who are gluten free ! . 
so far , i 've only had time to make waffles with this new gf bisquick , but they were delicious sometimes with gluten free products , you have to use other weird ingredients , or processes to make them these waffles were super fast , easy , and seriously delicious ca n't wait to make other things ! . 
the product is very good way too expensive and at almost 5 00 a box to get pancakes or biscuits i was disappointed . 
my family is gluten intolerant and we use this product extensively pancakes , biscuits , waffles , it does n't really matter what you need to bake , this mix comes through this is my go to mix above bob 's and all others we have tried try a box , follow the instructions for pancakes , and tell me they are n't awesome go ahead i dare you . 
i have tried numerous boxed gluten free flours , and i never get the consistent results i get from bisquick 's gf mix it 's also more economical than making your own \( who wants to buy 5 flours just to make a cake \? \? \) and this one never has that strange metallic smell others like bob 's have i find myself making pancakes , biscuits , cupcakes again after years of going bread free due to a wheat allergy br br my one complaint is that i ca n't seem to find this in any local store i have my fingers crossed that amazon continues to carry this ! . 
i have purchased san francisco bay coffee before i have always found that the quality of their coffee is excellent the beans are always well chosen and slow roasted a very high quality coffee at a reasonable price . 
the coffee was good but did n't have a strong flavor would n't buy this product again nice to try new products and try new flavors . 
i had tried a small batch of the pods for my keurig and fell in love this fog chaser variety is just about perfect i shall be ordering more beans so i never run out . 
oue two labs love these and they are soooo expensive in the pet stores \( 4 50 \) each we got these in bulk for under a dollar each . 
the thickness is just as described they are not thin as straws like some other reviews had stated my 2 pet chihuahuas love them very much it usually takes them an hour or so to finish chewing so it 's a great time passer for them one negative thing i 'd complain is the strong smell of the bag , though i have to tuck it away in a corner in order not to smell it often when pass by this might not apply to everyone , since my nose is a bit more sensitive than most normal people over all , i 'd had given 5 star if it was n't for the smell , i have to give 4 stars for now . 
great on any thing from rice to pasta to burgers i cant wait until the week end for my favorite over easy eggs , hash browns , and this mix more heat than you would expect , have tried a couple other brands , not the same . 
with all natural ingredients and no preservatives all i can say is fantastic there is no expiration date but i would eat this within a week or two faster if it 's opened absolutely excellent ! br br you can freeze these with no loss of quality br br do n't order if the weather is hot because they ship it in cool bags with cold packs instead of styrofoam with dry ice my orders usually arrive cool but not cold . 
in my opinion these are heads and twos above any pickle that you normally find at your local grocery store a lot of nice , sweet , pickle flavor i probably wo n't buy again off of amazon because of shipping charges , but if i ever see them locally , i 'll buy a bunch . 
i gave this as a stocking stuffer to my husband to remind him of our last holiday in beautiful jamaica it has a truly tropical taste that is very unique and yummy . 
best grapefruit soda on the market ! ! cost is good , but shipping is expensive i still buy it every now and then for a special occasion ! . 
i was looking for holiday sprinkles in bulk and lucked up to find these i have purchased this brand at williams and sonoma before but always in small containers i paid the same amount here for the bulk package i am very happy . 
what a steal ! i make a lot of gingerbread cookies during the holidays large ones over 6 long and i bag them in florist corsage bags they look like you bought them at a fancy store these decorations are the best and they are so cheap . 
india tree products are great and you cannot beat the value here at amazon i use these to decorate cakes and cupcakes they will get a workout as the holidays near . 
it must be true because it says so on the package america 's favorite cake br br i seem to remember a check box on the 2010 census regarding cake preference , but i do n't think i voted for yellow cake i would have voted for devil 's food cake , although it may be politically incorrect these days to mention , you know , the devil , so i may have voted for german chocolate cake , but germany is , you know , the old europe , so i may have voted for a chocolate cupcake but without peanuts because so many people are now allergic to peanuts that they ca n't even serve 0 5 grams of salted nuts on airplanes sigh br br where was i \? hmmm \? oh , yes br br i certainly would vote for duncan hines cake but i feel it should be mentioned that this is not cake yet this is cake mix br br its sort of a cake fetus , or a cake stem cell it still needs lots of development you have to add additional ingredients and warmth and time to develop the mix into a cake there is the promise of cake , but unless you follow the protocol written on the box very carefully , you may not get cake depending on what you do , you may get something very odd and rubbery or something very dark and charred br br it 's complicated ! br br amazon has allowed third party vendors to offer duncan hines cake mixes for sale for quite some time an example of this is a href http www amazon com gp product b0002ims5k duncan hines classic yellow layer cake mix 18 25 oz 6 unit pack a amazon , being a very clever retailer , has obviously read the numerous , highly enthusiastic customer reviews for this product , and has now started selling these products directly to its customers , so many of whom must be begging for a six pack of a product readily available in any supermarket or convenience store br br in order to enhance customer demand , amazon 's copywriters have outdone themselves listing this product 's outstanding features br br pack of six , 16 5 18 25 ounces each \( now 1 75 oz lighter ! \) br the moistest , most delicious br a special treat for the special people br br of course , the special people must be those who voted for duncan hines yellow cake mix that 's why it 's america 's favorite cake makes perfect sense this is a democracy ! this is a great country and this is great cake mix ! br br another thing you should know is that you get six boxes of cake mix this is enough mix to incubate a very , very big sheet cake that would require a very , very large incubator or oven you could also prepare a tall 12 layer cake which would kind of look like a miniature version of the coit tower in san francisco certainly enough the moistest , most delicious yellow cake for a very large number of the special people br br finally , a charming aspect is that on the very same page as this product , amazon suggests customers who bought this product also bought cottonelle fresh flushable wipes , refills , case of 4 84s \( 336 ct \) obviously , the special people anticipate getting down with this cake six boxes of cake mix is bound to make a mess in the kitchen and later on , there will be cake crumbs on lips and chins and fingers br br a few cottonelle fresh flushable wipes could come in handy ! br br smart ! . 
thanks for having it sent to me promptly i was very happy to be able to order it online and get it the next couple days . 
ghirardelli is n't the finest chocolate you can buy , but it 's pretty good , and the intense dark assortment is both inexpensive , and provides you a few possibilities br br i 've lately taken to unwrapping a 60 , 72 and 86 cacao square for each dinner guest and setting them on an individual saucer , to serve as an after dinner sampler with red wine or scotch that 's been a pretty popular approach a similar approach also works therapeutically if someone 's having a bad day , sitting them down with a small assortment of increasingly intense chocolate is n't a bad path to feeling a little better br br i do wish that there were the same number of each in the bag that 's the only downside of course , if you really want the sets of three to serve to guests , you 'll have to go through the tiresome task of somehow eating the extras darn . 
many reports are coming out about how chocolate is actually good for you , so eat more ! this is the perfect chocolate to do that with the varying levels of cocoa are perfect to help adjust your taste buds to eating dark , dark chocolate it 's not an easy transition for a milk semi sweet kinda gal , but this chocolate is affordable and so tasty i also like that i can just have one \( as they are individually wrapped \) , and choose my . 
i love this sampler of ghiradelli chocolate intense dark squares especially now that nutritionists recommend you have an oz of dark chocolate each day that is over 70 cacoa chocolate is a vegetable a friend reminded it 's a bean ! br br these chocolates are affordable , tasty , rich , intense , silky smooth and just the right size i love to serve them for after dinner the squares are fairly large and individually wrapped it 's great to have different amounts of cacoa depending on guests' tastes dark chocolate is an acquired taste for some of course , the darker the chocolate , the healthier so you can work your way up to the 86 cacoa great to have on hand for the holidays if you are on a diet and want a low calorie chocolate healthy treat , having these individually wrapped dilutes the temptation i'm happy with one square most days br br these are a great non guilty pleasure that are good for your health ! . 
i got this for a family member as part of a football themed gift i like that the basket can be reused i have had the pasta before , so i know it is good i do n't know how the other items taste . 
36 of these candy bars just might seem like overkill , but you can always tell yourself that you 're going to give them out to company ! of course , the truth is that they are way too good to give away to anybody they can just go get their own br br the good news is that they are shipped so fresh and soft that they will last 'till you can finish off your stash ! br br they 're awesome ! . 
this product is shipped so fresh that even if it takes your family months to eat their way through the box , the last 'bit o honey' will still be fresher than anything you can buy off the shelf at your local grocer these are the large candy bar sized , wrapped in wax paper because they are fresh , they are soft like taffy and so a breeze to extract from the wax paper , plus have the fullest flavor ever enjoy ! ! . 
they 're almost gone already , and i'm about 5 pounds heavier , but these candy bars are much fresher than anything in the stores if and when you can find an outlet that carries them ! yum ! . 
the bit o' honey candy that i ordered took me back to my childhood when i used to buy the product it arrived in a timely manner , in good shape , and of course it tasted delicous . 
excellent quality and so o o fresh a href http www amazon com gp product b000e5ao8o bit o' honey candy , 1 7 ounce packets \( pack of 36 \) a . 
i was glad i ordered this candy it still taste like it did 20 years ago . 
i was just going to reorder the bit o honey last me a long time and i enjoy eating it slowly in my mouth just like a kid ! . 
love my taffy br she 's so laffy br her name is bit o' honey br she gives me a kiss br oh what , a bliss . 
my neighbor and i love this candy and it 's difficult to find the 1 7 oz packets in the stores so i just decided to purchase a whole case they were fresh and great tasting . 
best bit o honey i have ever eaten br i have always bought this product at a local grocery store and it was always hard , i figured it was suppose to be that way but after eating the box i bought here i now know better the candy was soft and delicious br i plan to continue buying bit o honey from here . 
this is an excellent candy for those of us who have to limit our chocolate intake each bar is sectioned into six pieces , which helps with portion control and makes it perfect for sharing ! my only quibble is that it 's sometimes hard to get all the waxed paper off the candy , as it 's quite sticky . 
have n't had bit o honey since i was a kid and seeing them on amazon made the purchase a no brainer and they were as good as i remember . 
i hate honey but i love bit o honey candy i really do n't taste the honey in them i like the bars better than the individually wrapped candies because the shape is easier to eat i like them hard , brittle and chewy , not soft this is actually cheaper per bar than where i buy them locally . 
this was my second order of bit o honey br the first one arived with the celophane cut and one item missing br i hope mr sticky fingers found the candy as enjoyable as i did . 
dried berries , still with texture and the quintessential aroma pot roast is so much better with half a dozen berries flattened into the breadboard and scooped into the pickling mixture but in ten years , trying to find them gee so now i know to look for it on amazon . 
again , exactly what i ordered no fuss , no muss arrived on time pretty much an ideal transaction only thing that threw me was that i underestimated the quantity \( gallon baggie in the freezer , ftw \) . 
love these little peanut butter dipped granola bars they are delicious they are only one point on the weight watchers points system even you were not dieting , these bars are a great and filling snack . 
we love them ! this is a great 100 calorie snack i snack on them throughout the day my husband , and 3 year old enjoys eating them as well . 
i love pico pica it adds some flavor , and it 's not too hot i eat it at least 2 meals every day it 's good on eggs , it 's good on pizza , it 's good on vegetables br br really , you ca n't go wrong . 
thank goodness for mexgrocer we love this pico pica sauce i cannot find this product in local grocery stores anymore internet shopping makes living in a podunk town bearable no more long lists saved for the occasional trip to the big city i am on a first name basis with the ups and fedex drivers usps shipments are hit and miss , if they fit in the mailbox , great , if not , then it 's saddle up and head to town pico pica is our favorite product , it is so good ! love it ! . 
this is a very different sauce nothing like anything you 'll find in the grocery store it 's closer to the botique salsas that have recently appeared with the new taco restaurant trend it 's a little smokey my picky 3 year old will eat a burrito with this on it my family always had this \( mild \) on the table in southern california and now that i 've been transplanted in south florida i am happy to mail order you can get the little single serve pouches directly from the company , too . 
this company is an american classic been in business over 90 years why \? because it is the best hot sauce and taco sauce bar none there are some other good brands oout there , but this is the best and nothing compares to it the hot sauce has reasonable heat and bite and adds unique flavor to your favorite mex foods the taco \( mild \) sauce is milder and just perfect on tacos , enchaladas , tostadas , tamales , bell beefers , and frozen mex dinners the harder to find green sauce is to die for great on everything ! unfortunately i do n't see the green stuff on amazon but you can find it just get it try all three i grew up with this stuff so am very partial to it i keep about five or six bottles \( each variety \) on my shelves at all times after you try this you will not want to go back to the run of the mill commercial stuff a href http www amazon com gp product b0000gghzq pico pica mexican hot sauce 7 oz hot a a href http www amazon com gp product b0000ggi00 pico pica mild mexican hot sauce 7 oz a a href http www amazon com gp product b0084d71zm pico pica mexican hot sauce 7 oz hot \( pack of 3 \) a . 
i gave this as a gift and it was a big hit nothing was broken , it was gift wrapped \( paid for this \) , and even came with additional salt samples i was surprised at the amount of salt in each tube more than enough to get numerous meals of use out of each it was well recieved and i would n't hesitate to buy again i will say i think the shipping cost was a tad high , but the salt was a good deal so it evens out . 
i bought this product for a friend , but i liked it so much , i'm keeping it and buying a second one for my friend ! . 
i ordered this collection on 6 9 10 and it arrived on 6 12 although it was was very well packaged , this did not prevent the usps from managing to break one of the tubes the seller was contacted by email and a replacement requested as this was a birthday gift and the occasion was only a week away , i offered to pay for expedited shipping seller responded immediately stating that a replacement would be shipped asap the replacement tube arrived three days later in good shape my offer to pay additional shipping charges was declined in summary , this product is excellent and the customer service absolutely first rate i highly recommend both the product and the seller . 
i ordered this salt collection for my husband as a christmas gift he absolutely loves it and has used it every night since this is a great gift for anyone who enjoys cooking i will be ordering the second collection for him soon . 
what a great gift ! i bought it for a couple of foodie friends and they loved it it came beautifully packaged ready to gift i would totally recommend it . 
this is such a great product from subtle flavors and aromas for delicate dishes to smokey salts for hearty cooking , this is a great product for the chef who loves flavor and experimenting in the kitchen this is such a cool product ! ! . 
last year i gave this along with a href http www amazon com gp product 1845979125 salt cooking with the world 's favorite seasoning a to my foodie friends and family they all loved it ! the salt tubes were well packaged and i ordered 10 sets and had no broken tubes the package also came with salt samples which i really appreciate i have collection sets 1 and 2 on my counter and get lots of comments about them when people visit . 
i purchased the old world collection directly from the spice lab as a father 's day gift for my husband the item was extremely well packed and arrived ahead of schedule a small wooden salt spoon , sample packets of gourmet salts and a reference index card with information about each of the 11 salts were included brett was responsive and helpful this is a great company with an interesting variety of salts and spices i will definitely make a future purchase and refer the spice lab to others br br update i'm disappointed that my email reguarding a broken test tube and cork has gone unanswered the first time i used one of the salts , i was extrememly gentle but a large piece broke off as well as some of the cork top the tubes should not be so fragile so i sent an email to that affect to brett , the owner despite answering my initial email about how much i loved the gift and where could i post a positive comment , he has not responded with regards to the breakage good customer service would be to follow up . 
what a wonderful starter kit this is while i am and was familiar with some varieties of exotic sea salts , i certainly had not had the opportunity to try this many at one time tather than chance buying a product that i did not like and being stuck with it , this allowed me to give each and everyone a try br br i plan to order at least three more sets for presents this coming year for friends that , like me , are foodies br br this is an excellent product . 
this product is great and so is the company i had problem with the post office and they were right there to resolve the issue this is a great gift to yourself or to others . 
this is a very neat gift for someone you know that is into cooking and eating it has a wide variety of exotic salt represented in the collection br br there is a surprising amount of salt in the collection in other words , each tube holds about as much salt as would fill a small salt shaker . 
purchased this as a gift for a couple of salt loving friends it is great and attractive ! a note to purchasers we had one vial of the salt arrive empty and it says no returns , if you contact the seller directly they will work with you the seller send me a replacement vial \( very quickly \) and even sent a cool little salt dish along with it will definitely get this set for others \( maybe even me \) in the future . 
on sept 12 i posted the following seller review br 3 5 stars br i'm sorry to say that this item arrived with some slight cosmetic damage on the top front edge of the rack there is what i would call a dent , but it 's also rough from the way it was packaged i would have to say that it was that way when it was put into the box i intended this as a gift , and i do n't have time to return it , so i 'll just try to sand it down so it 's at least smooth br jammies , september 12 , 2012 br later amazon added br message from amazon this item was fulfilled by amazon , and we take responsibility for this fulfillment experience br br shortly after i posted it , i received an email from the spice lab inc offering to send a new block i sent them a couple of pictures of the damaged area they sent me a new block and two little spoons to replace the one that was missing from my original order the replacement block arrived yesterday in plenty of time for my trip to visit my son and daughter in law br br in hindsight , i should have contacted the spice lab before i posted the review , so they could have had time to resolve the problem i had jumped to the conclusion that i 'd need to return the item in order to get a replacement , which was n't the case br br since it 's a gift , i ca n't speak to the quality of the salt , but i can say that the block is very sturdy and attractive , and the little spoon is a charming addition br br i greatly appreciate the efforts of brett at the spice lab , and i would happily buy from them again . 
i got these salts for my boyfriend who loves to cook and love his salt ! the stand they come in is wooden and sturdy , much nicer than i expected ! the salts themselves are phenomenal and i have already bought the 2nd set ! . 
i bought this as a gift for a friend who likes exotic salts , and it was a hit with him it was well packaged with no breakage \( some of the reviews have mentioned that they received broken containers \) the wooden holder is nice but not all that permanent i would recommend this for someone who 'd like to sample various kinds of salt and does n't mind paying a high price the reason i gave it four and not five stars was the price . 
this taste is between something like flax bread and cornbread excellent toasted with butter and jelly did not raise my blood sugar at all i love it . 
i just had a wonderful dinner fresh fluke fried in a tempura batter the batter fried up perfectly lacy and crisp , both delicious and beautiful and low carb i floured my fish with the lc foods pan bread flour , and then used the same flour to make a batter with some low carb beer , salt , and a little smoked paprika an absolute knockout you really wo n't believe it 's low carb , but i'm about to test my blood sugar levels , and will report back in 90 minutes . 
my friend who lives in fla told me about these french twists and was complaining that she could n't find them here in middletown , oh i ordered 12 boxes to see what she was raving about and found only one problem with them i could n't stop eating them i ate 11 boxes of them in just a few days and gave the last one away so i would n't eat it too if a person can stop after eating 1 or 2 servings , they are a great addition to your diet unfortunately , i could n't stop ! ! ! ! ! . 
these french twists are delicious i am on weight watchers and 2 of these twists have a one points plus value all the flavors of these are fantastic you can eat cookies and still be healthy please barry 's bakery , never stop making these ! ! the price on these through amazon cannot be beat i have paid from 3 to 4 per box in the supermarkets i will be ordering another case soon . 
love these snacks great for a quick fix as well as a snack that doe n't add the huge calories or fat that concerns many ! great taste as well as consistency ! . 
i saw these in our local commissary one day and decided i had to give them a try i was only looking for something that might be a better for me choice to satisfy my sweet tooth i had no idea how much i would like these and have to have more i got one bag of the raspberry and one bag of the maple and i love them both ! ! ! i'm thrilled to see that they are a much healthier alternative than most baked goods , especially than the ones i normally choose i am not someone who is health consious or tends to read labels before buying an item i love these twists and am looking to buy them in a larger quantity so i can enjoy them more often ! they are light and flaky and satisfying and good a must for me ! . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b000i6g2oo barry 's bakery french twist , wild raspberry , 4 5 ounce box \( pack of 12 \) a br br i really love this product it is not available in our area we discoverd it in the north while visiting friends it is low cal and good for diabetics who need a sugar fix keep a good supply for future orders . 
i have bought this product before these snacks are crisp and great tasting also low in calories i recommend them highly they are shipped almost instantly and arrive within a few days . 
these shortbread cookies are delicious i bought some while in london this summer they are hard to find and expensive in usa . 
everything i bought was great , infact i ordered twice and the third ordered was br for my mother and father . 
i sent two babkas to a friend as a thank you he is a big seinfeld fan so he was thrilled to get both a cinnamon and chocolate babka br br he said the babkas were delicious ! ! ! . 
this is a great product great flavors and very fresh i received it quickly and damage free it is my opinion that this is a great value and i highly recommend it . 
at first , i was concerned about ordering babka online but i kinda missed this one as i tasted it the only thing i could say was wow i will order this again for sure . 
wonderfully cinnamon y ! i will definitely be ordering it again ! and heated up with a tiny bit of butter on it put it over the top in taste . 
looking forward to receiving this product and when it arrived it was covered in walnuts unfortunately , tree nuts are an issue and i wish that there was information about nuts on the items listing i will bring it to work for the staff to enjoy br br addendum staff loved the babka picture of product now shows nuts on top , prior listing did not 5 stars for the babka and 3 stars for the lack of ingredient list \( at least major allergens \) . 
love this stuff ! i add some diced tomatoes and a pound of ground hamburger and this is great ! i take it to pot lucks a lot . 
you ca n't beat the price and taste of this coffee it will always be my first choice to buy my husband brought it home one day because he liked the price and thought the the can looked neat little did we know it would become our new favorite . 
ca n't go wrong with this remember its jingle better coffee a millionaire 's money ca n't buy ! always priced right and in this economy that 's not always easy frankly i prefer it over starbucks where one can easily spend the same amount on one cup of coffee ! . 
every revolution product i have tried has been a wonderful experience revolution knows how to balance the inherit flavors of tea leaves with other ingredients which make each tea unique and enjoyable br br better than the rest br br i 've been buying this particular tea consecutively for the better half of a year now , and i simply love it no other pomegranate tea comes close to this one in terms of quality and taste for example , trader joe 's store brand \( while good \) seems as if it has been sweetened \( to the point where it 's too sweet \) , and surprisingly the tea turns red after less than a minute of seeping indicating that coloring was added \( i did n't check the ingredients , so i may be wrong about this \) there 's also yogi 's pomegranate tea which uses a green tea and creates an entirely different taste i liked it did n't love it br br complimenting flavors br br pomegranates are often compared to apples in fact , pomegranate means seeded apple \( from latin pomum apple and granatus seeded \) , and like an apple the fruit is sweet and tart , but has a very strong and distinct flavor thus , a light white tea is the perfect companion it does n't overpower the pomegranate flavor but allows it to mingle on the tongue likewise , the amount of pomegranate , or rather the intensity of the pomegranate flavor , is truly perfect no flavor overpowers the other , but rather all the flavors compliment one another br br brewing br br i'm sure someone out there will say that i'm butchering tea when i brew this , but when i do , i leave the tea bag in the mug until i 've consumed it all i find that the taste never gets too strong and never gets bitter typically this is only the case for herbal teas , which do n't become overpowered since they contain no tea leaves in this case the same is true , perhaps because it is a white tea which is naturally light the tea itself literally contains dried pomegranate seeds \( flesh included \) do you know that taste you get a few moments after you eat a pomegranate seed \? \( if you do n't , try it ! it 's wonderful \) that initial bite from the tartness followed by sweetness you get \( or at least i get \) from a pomegranate is captured in this tea , and it makes sense ! there 's pomegranate seeds in there ! br br conclusion br br buy this tea ! i was a little skeptical about my first purchase since i was buying 6 boxes , but it was a great choice that i do not in the least bit regret i 've bought this for myself and for family , with everyone absolutely loving it best 20 i have ever spent \( and continue to spend \) ! . 
enjoyable tea with a refreshing taste the 16 count pack of 6 represents an excellent buy compared to store prices . 
i love this tea i have issues with added flowers and flavorings in other teas and revolution teas tell you exactly whats in it and there are no additives ! i have been ordering from them ever since my first box of tea i take it to the office and i have a travel container and take it with me to restaurants . 
as an ex brit steeped \( pun intended ! \) in strong black tea , i was n't sure about this , but revolution white pomegranate tea is absolutely delicious , light yet flavorful the low caffeine content makes it ideal for an evening pot of tea and of course , iced tea i hesitated to recommend it in case you run out of it ! . 
revolution 's teas are superb smooth and delicate , each one has been pleasant , comforting and a pure delight i 've tried this one , the pomegranate , as well as ginger peach , dragon eye oolong , and white pear . 
i purchased this tea for someone who enjoys trader joe 's white pomegranate tea , and unfortunately it was not a good substitute though i have n't tried it myself i was told it had a strong floral taste and aroma which to that particular tea drinker was undesirable i am rating 4 stars since this is such a subjective judgement , and i have no doubts about this being a high quality product . 
i 've been using this tea for for about 6 months and drink it as iced tea daily br br i microwave my water on high in a pyrex 2 cup glass container for 2 minutes on high and then pop the little white mesh bags in for about 5 15 minutes i use about 3 4 bags for a rich taste and since i'm going to be pouring it over ice i put my ice cubes in a large glass and pour my hot tea over the ice , grab a straw and it 's ready to drink br br it also tastes good when i steep 2 bags of the revolution white pomegranate tea with 2 bags of the arizona pomegranate this is my favorite on ice the arizona is a green tea anyhow , this is my usual lunchtime pick me upper i want to note that i gave up drinking diet soda in march and has made this concoction my replacement it was a little difficult at first , but now that awful stuff is out of my system br br i have not tried this tea hot , as i am not a fan of hot tea , but i'm sure it 's just as delicious i subscribe to this and the arizona pomegranate green tea . 
this melitta decaf riviera sunset coffee has an excellent taste there is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees it 's a smooth , mellow taste , even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa i really enjoyed this the grind is listed as extra fine , but i did n't find it particularly fine myself when i grind my own beans , i have a finer grind than this , but i still expected a stronger taste from the melitta than i would from other store brands however , the melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried we like our coffee strong , about 1 2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1 2 cups water \( using measuring cups \) this ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the melitta , but that is easily adjustable the nice thing about the coffee is that , even when i made it very strong , the smoothness remained i will definitely be trying other types of melitta coffee in the future . 
the minute you open a bag of melitta riviera sunset you will think you are in starbucks the rich aroma is intoxicating , a promise of things to come i like my coffee a little stronger so i used a cup ground coffee with 12 ounces water after brewing the coffee my entire apartment was heavenly scented with a superior fragrance the first sip was like falling in love i literally felt heady the only thing i added was a little half half and two packets of stevia i would highly recommend that you have this coffee after dinner with your dessert this is truly an exceptional coffee ! i'm beyond impressed now i'm eager to try the melitta 's parisian vanilla ground coffee br br the rebecca review . 
melitta 's rich , flavourful product is a delicious treat comparable to coffees with a much higher price tag it is a plus that the decaffeinated version does not sacrifice flavour highly recommended . 
this is pretty decent coffee , for pre ground decaf here 's how a coffee snob reviews it br br unpacking br this coffee had to travel a long way to reach my house , and it was hot out heat and time are enemies of fresh coffee the package was pretty hard to open , i resorted to scissors the grind is very uniform with no detectible dust the smell is stale compared to the local fresh roasted , non decaf , beans i usually buy br br brewing br i busted out my cone and loaded two servings into a melitta filter i poured two cups of 200f water through the uniform grind is apparent in that the coffee did n't clog as it does with blade ground coffee \( due to dust \) i drank the coffee black br br tasting br the smell is of decaf and or instant coffee pretty stale but the decaf process is partly to blame overall i enjoyed it as much as any drip decaf i 've had recently there was no biting bitterness i drank two cups black without much of a gut ache br br pros br tight packaging with little air helps maintain freshness br excellent grind uniformity br low bitterness br br cons br not locally roasted br not fresh best by date is a year in advance br br verdict for mail order , pre ground decaf , this coffee lived up to expectations and was drinkable 3 or 4 stars . 
i love coffee i love coffee a lot and really do n't enjoy decaf this decaf is n't bitter though tastes smooth and brews up very nicely enjoyable to the last drop ! . 
this melitta cafe collection riviera sunset blend coffee is so full flavored , it 's much better than other decafs we have tried , and really tastes like regular coffee ! which is great because awe enjoy aided coffee ian the summer so no worries about it keeping us awake all night recommended ! . 
this melitta riviera sunset decaf makes a better than decent cup of coffee with medium body and just a little bite i used my my usual two heaping coffee scoops for six ounces of water in a bialetti stovetop espresso maker br br while i was enjoying the coffee , i read the package and saw that it recommends two level teaspoons of coffee for six ounces of water that got my curiosity up so i measured out my coffee scoop and it is one tablespoon since i use two heaping scoops , that 's slightly more than three times as much as suggested on the package following the directions would probably make a watery , undrinkable brew br br the coffee has a nice even espresso grind , perhaps a bit lighter than a french roast i would have guessed that it was primarily arabica with some robusta but melitta states that it is an all arabica blend from central and south america it is decaffeinated through the chemical free swiss water process which is the only acceptable way to decaffeinate as far as i am concerned br br also note the cute vintage travel poster style label and the clever name because it 's decaffeinated , it 's perfect to drink while watching the sunset . 
the main reason i drink decaf is to have the pleasure of coffee to go with dessert in the evening my caffeinated coffee is drunk in the morning only one cup so this coffee is pretty good with evening dessert since i wo n't get wound up flavor is good , packaged well , easy to brew . 
an excellent , bold , medium blend of decaf coffee for a special evening dark enough without being bitter and a perfect compliment for a light desert ! . 
i had never heard of this coffee before but i got a bag and really liked it this melitta cafe riviera sunset decaf is a very good decaf with a good taste and body this stuff is perfect for a late night cup of coffee or for a cup with some dessert its decently priced and i will definitely buy this again . 
melitta 's riviera sunset decaffeinated ground coffee turned out to be a good basic coffee not bitter , not burned tasting , a well rounded mellow brew that tastes like real coffee i had it this morning with almond milk , stevia and a pinch of cinnamon , and though i 'd had a bad night and did n't even know if i could handle coffee , it was delicious and easy on a morning tummy besides brewing it alone to get a nice decaffeinated coffee for night time drinking \( especially in the winter \) , we 've been mixing it with regular coffee in various blends , depending on our caffeine related needs at the time br br the packaging is practical and easy to re close and the grind is good for my automatic coffeemaker i will buy this one again . 
i like this coffee it smells good while brewing and tastes as good as it smells for a decaf coffee it is very good br will definitely buy this at my local store . 
this stuff tastes great ! i am not a decaf person , but perhaps i am being won over by melitta coffee try it ! . 
i love coffee and admit that i am particular when it comes to good coffee i was not expecting much from this coffee and was pleasantly surprised to discover it was quite good it falls into the likes of starbucks and other shade grown coffee brands deep , rich flavor br br though i enjoyed it , i am not sure i would purchase this unless it was on sale i do find it a bit overpriced if you do n't mind spending the money , you will be happy with this coffee otherwise , i would suggest purchasing this on sale for a special occasion . 
wonderful , smooth , satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor no chemical aftertaste , like many decafs i 've tried apparently , the swiss water process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact , something i 've found terribly disappointing in other brands br br i 've been very impressed by the flavor dimensions of this riviera sunset blend served it to some neighbors \( who simply wo n't touch decaf coffee \) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf no bitter notes my husband , who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf , has been asking for a cup of this every evening , after dinner believe me , this alone is quite an endorsement ! br br i love using my a href http www amazon com gp product b0011528s0 zojirushi cd wbc30 micom electric 3 liter water boiler and warmer , champagne gold a for coffee , tea , and cooking i brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual melitta brown paper filter a href http www amazon com gp product b001e5e0t2 melitta cone coffee filters , natural brown , no 2 , 100 count filters \( pack of 6 \) a and filter cone \( similar to this one a href http www amazon com gp product b001794q0s ready set joe mug a \) and found that the extra fine grind of the riviera sunset blend imparted an unusually rich , deliciously multidimensional flavor much fresher than conventional , by the pot coffee this method also allows me to brew strong coffee \( for me \) and a milder version for my hubby br br take time to bloom the grounds first \( add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds , moistening completely , and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing \) for best flavor \( this goes for any coffee \) br br melitta 's riviera sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob ! you 'll love it as is , no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor i look forward to ordering more br br update 9 21 10 just ordered my first 3 pack through subscribe save great deal for some delicious decaf ! . 
i enjoy my coffee with plenty of sugar and a flavored creamer this provided a good base for that experience as a non connoisseur , this is just about right not too strong , not bitter , good coffee flavor br br for the sake of comparison , i most often drink the ground version of a href http www amazon com gp product b001eq55mm eight o'clock coffee , 50 decaf whole bean , 12 ounce bags \( pack of 4 \) a right now on amazon , melitta 's is slightly more expensive per ounce , though subscribe and save would even it out and melitta 's brewing instructions call for using a smaller amount of grounds i would expect them to be about the same quality , and in my opinion they were this is certainly a coffee i'm happy to drink when i want decaf br br one downside is the bag my husband got to it before i did , but he reported that it required scissors to get it open the resealing feature on the bag then could n't be used , so we made the transfer to another sealed container . 
my wife and i both thought this is a nice cup of coffee the bag has a one way valve on it to keep the air out and arrived virtually flat when brewed in our cuisinart drip coffee maker it has a nice aroma i take mine with cream and sugar , and mrs b drinks hers black we both thought it was smooth , with no bitterness later it made a nice after dinner coffee when we added our favorite liquor tho i am no coffee snob , i can tell a good cup of coffee from a bad one , and this one makes the grade . 
i do not like coffee too much actually i am very particular about coffee and i can say that this is one of my favorites it is so smooth and flavorful , the smell is really good and i ca n't have enough of it i have gone as far as skipping going to starbucks or dunkin for coffee br the price is decent for this kind of product so i highly recommend it . 
first off , let me state that i am not a fan of decaffeinated coffee of any type but i often have guests over who ask for de caf , so i gave this a try br br while i agree with some other reviewers who have stated that there is a certain different taste about this blend , for me , it was not a bitter taste , but instead , a good , strong flavor that mimicked the strong \( real \) coffee taste i enjoy i had a second cup , and the flavor grew on me even more , and i thought it really is delicious for a decaf br br the aroma is n't truly satisfying \( why does this always happen with decaf \? \) but i think many decaf drinkers will be used to that lack br br the package had to be snipped open with scissors this is tightly packed ! and then i just poured it into a zip loc for storage in the fridge br br i 'll stick with regular coffee , but i'm sure my de caf loving friends will enjoy this . 
i am a coffee lover it is one of the few pleasures of my life so i was excited to review this product once received i opened it up and gave a good sniff i know to some that may sound stupid , but i love to open coffee and have the aroma surround me , this coffee did not do that as much as others that i have used i had to really give a good sniff to smell the aroma , but it smelled pretty good once i got my nose in there br br i set out to brew myself a pot i followed the directions and enlisted my husband to have a cup with me now usually i do not drink decaffeinated , so i was just a little concerned decaf to me can taste very flat but i waited and a nice smell filled the air finally our coffee was ready and we both sat down to taste this product my husband smiled he loves any coffee that has arabica beans he looked at me and said , ummm this is really good my turn i sniffed some more , i'm a real sniffer before anything goes into my body it still smelled pretty good so now for the taste test br br okay , it was definitely different than the dunkin donuts coffee that i'm use to and love however , it had a smooth flavor , but a little richer than i like and i did n't seem to notice that it was decaf , that was a good thing it was flavorful and made a pretty good cup of coffee hubby liked it a lot so i would have to say it was a winner , a good rich coffee flavor and a good price . 
i'm a big coffee drinker \( much against my better judgement \) , but due to a stomach condition , i 've been forced to drink mostly decaf for the last few years i usually just get the cheapest coffee i can find near my office after all , i do n't make a lot of money and every penny counts so it was nice to get this melitta cafe ground coffee to sample br br when i made my first cup , i was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma i put in a little cream and 4 splendas as i usually do , and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter maybe it 's because this is decaf , but what i did like was its pureness , something 50 cent coffees usually lack i have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days i 've grown to like this coffee granted , to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness , but even i can tell this is gourmet coffee , much better than the ones i get at my local coffee stands or even at mcdonald 's \( when they give out free cups \) br br for a pack of 3 , the price seems decent if you drink decaf , i think this is quite worth a try . 
i would recommend this as a good basic coffee it has a satisfying flavor and will make many a good cup of coffee i prefer drinking my coffee black and i found this to be produce a good cup it is not bitter and even though i had the decaffeinated coffee , it did not taste flat like so many decafs do . 
my wife finds it bizarre that i enjoy a good cup of joe just before i call it a night yeah , sometimes i get a little spiky due to too much caffeine intake and so i thought i 'd give this decaff a go what you get is a good cup without any bitterness but it 's a little weak and i recommend dropping about 50 more into your brewer to get a fuller flavor also , as it 's vacuum packed into a slim cardboard box it arrived completely squished flat nothing like the fat photo in the amazon product shot i know it 's a minor thing to complain about but i like leaving my coffee out next to the coffee maker and this item would n't even stand up it was about 1 2 thick ! br br so you 're not going to have mr wolf commending you for your great coffee with this one but for a decaff it ai n't half bad . 
great not like other decaf , which seems to hav a weird taste to me if you keep trialing different decafs to find one you like , definitely give this a try . 
i like the smooth taste of this coffee it is decaf so not too strong but really not very light either it 's just the light coffee that sometimes needed at mid day recommended . 
this is good for packaged ground coffee , and for decaf , it definitely has a strong coffee flavor this is great for that winding down cup of coffee late night that wo n't keep you up because of the caffeine br br each sealed package holds ten ounces of extra fine ground coffee the bag feels sturdy if you prefer to keep your ground coffee in its original packaging br br with coffee prices going up , it may be a good idea to compare the prices of this \( if you try this and like it , you get a better price with the amazon subscribe save option \) versus getting coffee beans from your local coffee shop and grinding them at home or having the coffee shop grind them for you . 
disclaimer i'm a coffee addict i'm also a starbucks addict , so i 've become a bit snobby about my coffee preferences and ca n't stand the economy stuff i 've had regular melitta coffee before and was favorably impressed by it , so i decided to give the decaf version a try especially when the weather gets cold , i like a nice hot cup of coffee in the evenings and do n't particular want to be tossing and turning hours later br br the riviera sunset decaf coffee is an excellent decaf for those times you do n't want the real thing it had a nice , rich flavor with no bitter aftertaste while i continue to prefer the real thing on most occasions , i'm glad to know there 's a good , flavorful substitute for when i do n't want caffeine . 
smooth with no sacrifice in taste and does taste as good as regular coffee i usually do n't have any coffee after dinner and never really cared for decaf but i now have an after dinner alternative and no sacrifice in flavor . 
boy , this was good the aroma when you first open the package leaves one with great anticipation that you will soon be enjoying a great cup of java too often times , the result does not meet the expectations not so with the melitta cafe collection ! the coffee was amongst the best i have ever tasted treat yourself to a fantastic splurge ! . 
i am not a big fan of decaffeinated coffee i figure what 's the point \? taste is so often compromised i have recently found that caffeine bothers me if i drink it after 7pm so it 's decaff or nothing at that point riviera sunrise tastes like regular coffee i was so impressed i decided to try it as my morning coffee i expected to have a very negative response to not getting the morning caffeine of my usual coffee but that did not happen if you must give up caffeine this is a great solution . 
i 've decaffinated a few times and always find myself returning to caffinated coffee for the flavor with this product i wo n't have to do that anymore the flavor of this coffee is exceptional it 's as full and rich as any off the shelf coffee i 've ever tasted highly recommended . 
this melitta riviera sunset blend is a nice , and light coffee that is suitable for anytime of day it 's particularly great for drinking at night because it is decaffeinated the texture is nice , and does not have an acidic taste or anything it 's meant for casual drinkers i do prefer my coffee darker , with caffine , but i did enjoy this blend i would recommend giving this a try and judge for yourself . 
this coffee was deep and rich , and did not have a bitter taste too it i did have to use a little more than what was recommended to get it the way i drink coffee but coffee is a personal thing everyone has their desired strength the coffee was fresh upon opening but began to go down hill really quick as far as aroma and taste goes , so invest in a good air tight container i liked this coffee , but it i could go on in the morning if i did not have it . 
we do n't drink much coffee , and less decaf , but we have guests who do and so we like to keep some ground decaf in the freezer for when they visit everybody has been pleased with the melitta nobody has complained about the taste , and plenty of folks have asked for second cups so they were n't just being politely quiet we got the first sample free through the vine program but i would buy it in the future . 
melitta cafe is a smooth , flavorful coffee that compares well with regular coffee this is not the typical weak decaf blend that is true of many american brands melitta has a rich , deep taste and a nice dark color tastes great black or with cream as a stand alone coffee \( no cream sugar \) it has a smooth , though strong flavor just like regular coffee this coffee is especially great as an after dinner drink strong enough to taste like regular coffee but decaffeinated so it will not prevent sleep later great coffee . 
this product had a good nice scent and strong taste not too unique compared to a lot of over the counter canned decaffs already available but overall , it 's a good after dinner type of coffee to serve guests br br price wise , it 's reasonable but there are many other comparable products that may have a more distinguished taste overall , it 's a good product and worth trying for decaff drinkers . 
this coffee has a nice flavor , not too bitter , just a nice round coffee taste rich flavor , naturally decaffeinated with water , and it 's kosher what 's not to love \? . 
i 've blended this with a darker full caf melitta coffee and love the results br br the fine grinding is a tad small for the french press i use , but the taste is wonderful br br i was a little concerned at the darkness variation in the two when i decided to blend , but the outcome was fine br br the only real complaint i have is the packaging cheap glue on the metal fold down part causes it to fall off \( true for both bags i received \) , so do n't rely on that br br otherwise , a delicious coffee that is mellow in taste the way i choose to prepare it . 
this is an excellent coffee , rich and full of flavor \( not watery \) many decaf 's are obviously decaf this one tastes great , with a medium body the grind is fine , which works great in our drip coffee maker it also has a nice aroma and no bitter aftertaste it does n't have the burnt flavor that a certain large coffeehouse chain has , which personally i do n't care for i found it closer to einsteins house blend , but much better br br this is a great quality coffee , highly recommended i will be buying more . 
i'm a big coffee drinker , and this melitta cafe offering is rich with no bitterness sometimes decaf coffee has a funny , oily aftertaste , but this coffee had none of that unpleasantness highly recommended . 
i have a keurig coffee maker you know , the one with the k cups to have a coffee like this , you have to have a special filter , which i do have honestly , you 'll spend a crapload of money on k cups if you do n't get the filter for regular ground coffee anyway , i do n't know if it was because the coffee was ground or filtered a special way , but the water in my keurig had a hard time seeping through , causing a bit of an overflow aside from that , the taste was smooth and flavorful it has a coffee taste , plain and simple is it anything special , not really it just tastes good and is reasonably priced . 
i have been enjoying the melitta coffee in the evening it has a nice smooth taste with none of the burnt coffee bean taste of starbucks i used much more coffee than suggested in preparation though i used 2 tablespoons to eight ounces of water i like my coffee strong but not bitter and this worked for a very good cup of coffee with half and half added i will be buying it again . 
very smooth and i used my own filters the smell is so inviting , i used my own measurements because it was not on the package i used l tblsp per cup and i worked out fine for me , i like my coffee tasteful . 
if melitta does n't sell good coffee , who does \? i grew up using melitta filters and still individually make each cup of coffee in a single cup filter generally i use pre ground coffee \( so i am not a purist \) , although i occasionally grind my own i usually drink two cups of coffee a day enough about my coffee habits br br melitta is a pretty trusted name in the coffee industry and i expected this coffee to be be a quality product i was not disappointed with the coffee , although it was not quite as exciting as the regular vanilla flavored coffee i recently tried from melitta the flavor was pretty strong and rich , although decaf always has a slight aftertaste , even with the swiss water process used for decaffeinating generally i drink regular coffee as my first choice , but i admit that i switch to decaf in the evening br br i have no problem recommending this coffee as a second choice . 
i do not like decaf coffee i think it has an aftertaste but , i thought i would give this a try it truly surprised me there is a mellow , full bodied taste with very little aftertaste to be found i will definitely buy it again to reduce the caffein in our household . 
i'm not a huge fan of coffees from the americas i generally find them a bit light for my taste \( i'm a big fan of sumatra and other pacific grown coffees \) but riviera sunset is a nice , light coffee , smooth and not terribly acid it 's a pleasant coffee for people who like their brews with more brightness and less body br br i'm also frankly not nuts about decaf , but that aspect does n't intrude too much on the flavor here . 
i am a coffee fan who drinks my coffee black nothing is added to alter the flavor of the coffee as a result of this habit i find myself somewhat more critical of how a coffee tastes as a general rule i prefer an arabica bean but i could not find a reference to bean type on the bag curious i checked their web site and found they use the arabica bean exclusively br br on the front of the bag there is reference to the process used to decaffeinate the rivera sunset coffee the swiss water process is used their web site provides a detailed explanation of this process which involves the removal of water soluble caffeine unroasted coffee beans are immersed in heated water for several hours to remove the water soluble caffeine present in the beans , as well as those coffee components that easily dissolve in water the water is then drained from the beans and filtered or processed to remove the caffeine from the water this decaffeinated water is then reintroduced to the coffee beans , allowing the flavor and aroma components to be absorbed by the coffee finally , the coffee is dried and ready for roasting br br more information is provided on the web site concerning the bean growing and selection process i found the web site to be user friendly and well thought out br br another habit of mine is the use of distilled water to brew coffee i 've found that public water supplies can provide water with a multitude of different tastes which can negatively influence the flavor of the coffee br br let me finally mention the flavor of the coffee itself first it is very smooth and rich i almost never have more than one cup of coffee at a time but found myself thinking more would be nice that is very rare ! the coffee had a delicate fruity flavor which i found pleasing br br i did face one challenge with this coffee the bag was very difficult to open without tearing it after working on it for several minutes , i had decided i was not going to let a bag beat me , i discovered that i was able to open it be starting at the end where the bag was folded back once i got my finger inside the bag the rest came comparatively easy fortunately the two small tears i made in the bag were high enough to fold under when the bag was closed the bag recommends storage in a refrigerator br br this coffee is pleasant and refreshing and i have enjoyed drinking it if you are a coffee lover you owe it to yourself to give this coffee a try and see what you think i hope you 're as pleased with it as i am ! . 
ok i have to admit i was a huge sb fan \( you know , that big stellarmoney coffee chain on every corner \) i did n't expect much from a coffee ordered online , but i take any thoughts back after the first sip of this smooth , rich coffee there is none of the gritty , acidic after taste of other coffees but instead a blooming , silky flavor of nuts , mocha , and pure coffee mind you , this is n't a flavored coffee , it has all of these nuances built into the riviera sunset decaf blend oh did i forget to mention it 's decaf \? i could n't believe it myself when i looked at the bag the second day ! i thought it was true , caffinated coffee by the flavor alone , though i did notice the lack of energizing \( as would any decaf \) highly recommended and i am switching ! . 
this coffee has a more present flavor than the stuff they brew for us at work , yet it goes down smoothly to my wife and i , that 's a good combination the fact that it comes already ground does n't do anything to subtract the flavor either . 
i'm far more of a tea drinker than a coffee drinker , but i ca n't start the day without a cup or three of coffee plus , i'm not really awake until i smell the coffee brewing just not morning without it br br i tend to buy more affordable \( e g , supermarket type brands \) of coffee so i can splurge on tea so this was a real treat outstanding aroma just opening the bag , and even better when brewing delightfully smooth taste , and highly drinkable black \( the only way i drink coffee or tea \) br br my only complaint is opening the bag based on what other reviewers stated , i opened it over a plastic bin so it would catch any spills very glad i did an appreciable amount was spilled when i cut into the bag i decanted it into an air tight container i 've had this problem with other vacuum packed coffee , but the very fine grind of the melitta made it even more of a problem br br still , not enough of a problem to warrant taking away a rating star this makes a wonderful cup of coffee ! . 
i 've tried to give up my coffee habit , but it just has n't been easy dh and i did manage to switch to decaf a couple years ago , so i suppose that 's something i'm a moderate coffee drinker i like 1 2 cups of hot joe to get me started in the morning , and love a nice chilly iced coffee on a hot afternoon this melitta riviera sunset decaf is smooth and does n't have the bitter aftertaste that i dislike in one of the leading coffeeshop brands the flavor is great and i 've enjoyed it both hot and iced . 
what can you say about coffee , either you like it or you do n't i liked this coffee , although when i choose to review it i did n't notice it was decaf that aside , it tastes fine \( made in my keurig \) but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one . 
the coffee is excellent , with a smooth taste and pleasant aroma it did not have that bitter plastic aftertaste you find in a lot of decaf coffees br br the grind is very fine , my cheapo coffee filters let a little bit of the coffee through use good quality filters with this coffee br br it was difficult to open the package , and the little wire closer fell off after the second time however , i understand why coffee is packages this way , to minimize the exposure of the oils in the coffee to air and of course a fine grind has a larger surface to mass ratio , making it age even faster so i forgive them for the packaging you really need an airtight opaque container to store this kind of coffee br br personally i like to grind my coffee right before using , but the convenience and taste of this melitta has convinced me that there are other options . 
first , let 's talk about the packaging i hate when coffee come packaged in bags like this they 're quite cumbersome and in my opinion , do not keep the coffee fresh enough br br as for the coffee itself , this was one of the better tasting decaf 's i have had it has a very rich flavor that you do not normally find with decaffeinated coffee it has a wonderful aroma as well very pleased with this product . 
when it comes down to melitta , they definitely have known for all this time , what it takes to really made a great cup of coffee with their cafe collection , they definitelly bring out the best in flavors for all kinds of coffee lovers , and that is really a strong aroma with their rivera sunset , they definitely bring out a decaffinated taste that feels like it is full of pep at the beginning of the morning i really love it the taste is strong and the intimate aroma is just delightful all in all , i absolutely recommend this as a great treat in the morning to wake up and enjoy br br price b br br taste b br br overall b 1 2 . 
this coffee smelled wonderful while it was brewing my husband drinks a lot more coffee than i do , and he agreed that this is a great tasting coffee we are looking forward to trying melitta 's other varieties . 
i am not much of a coffee drinker , mainly because i do not drink caffeine , and because i have never acquired the taste for coffee however , i was tempted to try this product , and i was really surprised by how good it tasted it did not have any of the bitter after taste , and more importantly , i could not tell that it was decaffeinated this is important because most decaf coffees have an odd taste to me , but that oddness was missing from this product br br furthermore , i had to ask a coffee lover for an opinion , so i asked my mother in law , who drinks all kinds of coffees from all over the world almost 5 times a day she was skeptical at first , because she refuses to drink decaf however , after a few sips of this coffee , she said that although it is a mild coffee , it was in fact very tasty and nothing hinted at its decaf origins she liked it so much , she poured another cup br br between the two of us , we have almost finished the bag it should pass the test from even the pickiest coffee drinkers i positively recommend this product , and i hope you enjoy your next cup of coffee from this company . 
i prepared this coffee in a french press \( although it is ground too fine for this \) it had a nice aroma , a full taste and mild bitterness it 's a fools game to try to describe the taste of anything in any detail so i 'll just leave you with the coffee was quite good and it would make a good after dinner coffee br br my only complaint is the coffee is pre ground ground coffee is a bit stale by the time you get it , however , a blade grinder will ruin the coffee as well br br if you do n't own a burr grinder , this is the best cup of decaff you 're going to get . 
this is the best decaf my family and i have tried in a long time it 's smooth , not bitter and has enough flavor without being too strong like some other brands i 've tried i like that it 's decaffeinated using the natural swiss water process instead of chemicals that 's a big plus for me because many brands do n't tell you how they decaffeinate their coffee i usually buy whole bean , but this ground is so nice and fine , and it saves me time having to grind it and get it just right i 'd suggest following the instructions given on the bag for the best taste , seal tightly and store in the refrigerator to keep the flavor this is one i 'll be buying again . 
this review is from my wife br br i'm not one who has all the right words for describing taste and flavor , unfortunately i say unfortunately because this is a very good tasting coffee and it deserves elegant description what i can tell you is that it has no edgy bitterness no bitterness at all , actually it 's rich and smooth yum br br i use a european coffee press for brewing and this grind worked beautifully in that not too course , not small enough to make a mess through the screen . 
at last a decaf coffee that does n't taste decaf ! smooth , rich , flavorful , with no bitter aftertaste starbucks worthy \( but to my husband who does n't care for starbucks , it 's way better \) we like to drink this in the evening and it 's basically dessert with cream and sugar . 
melitta 's cafe collection gourmet coffee is wonderful it tastes rich , and just like a gourmet coffee should this coffee tasted like something i could have gotten in europe at a cafe br br it brewed very quickly , and with no coffee grain residue this is probably due to the coffee being an extra fine grind the decaffinated version tasted great on its own , without milk or sugar to season br br i'm a coffee lover , and i enjoy gevalia and godiva coffee two other excellent foregn brands the melitta stands on its own , and are their equivalents in taste and price enjoy a cup today ! . 
soon as i got this bag of decaf i made a big mug and it filled my house with the wonderful aroma of high quality fresh brewed coffee it is very finely ground but i still used the same amount i normally do and it turned out great i added some soy milk , sat back , and enjoyed my rare treat of an after noon coffee break ! ! ! definitely will buy some of this for the winter months so i can treat myself to excellent hot coffee any time of the day or night ! . 
i often find with decaf coffee to be somewhat on the weak side not in this product the coffee had a strong grip , but not bitter , and had a smooth rounded experience when a creamer is used \( note this coffee works well with a soy creamer \) you do not need to apply any extra heap of coffee to compensate for a 'decaf' option ! with such a strong grip , i would not recommend milk or low fat milk as you might as well drink it as is ! . 
i am in no way any coffee expert , connoisseur , or heavy user to be perfectly honest , i had to look up how to spell connoisseur ! but having a heart attack 6 months ago , i am learning to never use caffeine , salt , or almost any darn thing i love and i hate anything that is light , decaf or artificially sweetened my wife has bought about every single brand of instant decaf coffee for me along with assorted real decaf to try in her drip coffee maker hated em all , just hated them saw this so thought i would try the latest brand i would hate since it would n't cost me anything br br first batch was way to bitter for me , did n't even want to try any more but my wife said she would make it weaker from that next batch on , i became hooked on this brand i do n't like the price , but love the taste that conflict alone makes me drop my rating to give it a 4 star overall if i tinker with taste as i also add assorted coffee mate creamers \( also something i am not allowed anymore but refuse to give up \) , the taste goes to a 5 for me even with all the discounts if i order through the subscribe save program \( see below \) , i find this a bit pricey br br br br update december 4 2010 br it still pains me to pay so much but looks like this will be the very 1st vine program item i ever got that will make an actual buyer out of me as a result , i raise my review from 4 stars to 5 starts another thing i like is i have no decaf aftertaste that i always experience with other brands it is a wonderful thing to find at least one new thing \( for me anyway \) that i can still really enjoy , that helps me relax in the middle of all this ca n't eat this , ca n't drink that stuff going on in my life the past 6 months it 's also the time i have n't felt like i was compromising good taste for good health for that , i am truly grateful just ordered the 3 pack on the amazon subscribe save page . 
i remember the cool , modern melitta drip coffee makers from decades ago a visual delight of glass and wood \( without a hint of plastic \) , they were elegantly ahead of their time i wish i could say the same for their coffee it 's fine coffee good , actually however , nothing really special i would buy it again if priced right , but probably would not go out of my way to get it , and certainly not at a gourmet price point i must be honest and say that with the melitta name , i expected a little bit more maybe i just got a an off batch let 's hope so . 
on an untypically cool august evening we decided to try melitta riviera sunset decaf i heaped in too much coffee and what we got was a bitter , overly heavy cup i know others like their coffee to curl their hair with strong taste we like it strong but not that much on our next try we used less coffee and enjoyed a delightful semi sweet cup of decaf it was pleasing those who love strong , robust , full bodied taste ought to definitely buy melitta brand coffees . 
if you like to have a cup of coffee after dinner with desert then this is perfect i love it especially for the fact that i do n't feel like a live wire all night from having caffine and the flavor is amazing nothing like a good cup of coffee to make you feel warm and fuzzy after a wonderful dinner br br i have tried many different coffee 's and have to say this one has a wonderful full flavor without the bite of some of the cheaper coffee 's melitta is a great brand and well worth the money i also use this to make latte 's and it 's great it 's a really fine grind and great for which ever way you prefer to have you cuppa java you get what you pay for and this is well worth every penny . 
riviera sunset decaffinated coffee , from the melitta caf eacute collection , is a good coffee for that first , morning cup of coffee it is a south american blend for those who prefer a brighter more acidic kind of brew , but is still well balanced and make s a fine cup of java br br the coffee comes in an attractive , black bag with a bag with the now ubiquitous air valve the folks at melitta know how to compact coffee for travel all ambient air was sucked out of the bag , shrinking the usual size of the 10 ounces from its expected size , to a small , dense brick cutting open the bag , there was an audible hiss as the bag seemed to expand to double its size the aroma was intoxicating think deep coffee with chocolate hints and with nothing acrid about it the bag does not indicate the level of the roast , but on inspection the coffee appears to be a darker roast \( somewhere between a `full city' and european \) the bag states that this is an extra fine grind , but on inspection it seems to be less powdery than you 'd want for fine espresso , and is more of a fine grind this , i imagine , is meant a compromise so that the coffee is suitable for both the common drip coffee machines that use a filter or could be used with an espresso machine br br for some reason , the instructions indicate that you should use two level teaspoons for every six ounces of water i'm not sure how they drink coffee in europe , but in the us coffee machines measure by the cup this leads to a bizarre 2 7 teaspoons of coffee per cup and \( to my taste \) a slightly weak cup of coffee in spite of the grind , i 'd stick with the usual 1 tablespoon per cup proportion for your drip coffee maker and work up from there your intuition should serve you well , and i 'd stick with your usual measurements \( i'm one of those `heaping' tablespoon per cup guys \) br br the coffee definitely shows its south american origins in spite of the darkness of the roast and richness of the aroma , the coffee once brewed is more light , breakfasty , and slightly more acidic than i imagined it would be given the type of coffee that it is , it also might have benefited from a slightly lighter roast still , it is a well balanced south american blend it lacks the distinctiveness of a single origin coffee but given that it is a blend has a more rounded , less biting flavor although decaffeinating can sometimes sap the bold flavors of a coffee , this coffee still has a lot of personality and a distinctive taste br br this is not for the pure coffee lover who likes a dark , earthy , and oily cup of java that can basically stand on its own this coffee is more for people who like to add a lot of buffer a fair amount of milk and sugar or one of those torani syrups \( e g a href http www amazon com gp product b001e5e2qs torani syrup , vanilla , 25 4 ounce bottles \( pack of 3 \) a \) for a little extra flavor , for those who like those kind of things it also makes a great iced coffee if cold brewed , the coffee loses its tannic edge and is more smooth and sweet , but also loses a little personality in the process \( i did not try using this in an espresso machine as i do not have one , but i do n't think that it would yield a great espresso concentrated , i think the acidity might become overwhelming \) br br all in all , this is a fine blend of coffee at a fine price with a little experimentation on the proportions , it yields a fine cup of breakfast coffee . 
this coffee had two strikes against it it was decaf , and it was already ground i do use decaf , generally in a 50 50 mix with full strength caffeinated coffee , but i always like to grind my own beans to assure freshness still , i thought i 'd give this melitta coffee a shot \( it was free from vines , after all \) i'm happy to say it surpassed expectations i made a pot without mixing it with anything and drank it black , as i always do it 's surprisingly drinkable , if a little on the light side still , the taste is fairly rich and appealingly winey , though i do like a little more smoky aftertaste than this provides \( there 's really not much aftertaste at all , truth be told \) it 's as good if not better than nearly all the straight decaf coffee i 've ever had , and having it ground as opposed to beans really does n't seem to be an issue here ground coffee does tend to go stale more quickly than bean , so i 'd suggest using it fairly quickly , but that 's easy to do with a 10 ounce bag if you 're a decaf drinker and prefer not to have to grind beans , i 'd highly recommend this brand . 
i have had to cut back on caffeine recently because of heart palpitations that seemed to be made worse by all the coffee i drink \( 5 cups a day , maybe \) so i am mixing 1 3 melitta colombian and 2 3 decaf i substituted this for the other decaf i have been drinking and found that it has a rich smooth taste very little to none of the burnt taste that decaf often has the price on amazon makes it a pretty good buy as well i do n't care for the packaging , however i could n't get it open without cutting the top , and then i had to transfer it to an old coffee can to store it , with all the mess that that entails if it were in a can , i would be more inclined to buy it but the taste for a decaf is quite good . 
i'm surprised how much it tastes like coffee to be completely accurate , it tastes like a watered down coffee \( like the kind you get at hotels \) with hazelnut flavor and a very slight earthy undertone if someone gave me a sip and did n't tell me what it was , i 'd think it were coffee , let 's put it that way br br there 's not all that much root per teabag though , and since i like strong coffee i only use 6 oz of water per bag and steep it covered for 15 mins then with some cream and sugar it 's quite good br br as for the liver tonic claim , well dandelion stimulates bile flow and supposedly helps clear out some stuff gunking up the liver i do n't know about that yet , but so far i have n't noticed any ill effects from drinking this i feel fine , if not outright good after drinking a cup , but that 's as far as i can confirm the effects br br and with even decaf coffee containing 5 15 mg caffeine per serving , this stuff being completely caffeine free is a blessing for those of us who go bananas and light public property on fire when we get the slightest bit of caffeine anyone who needs a coffee substitute , do give this a try . 
i have been taking this tea twice per day and i am enjoying the way i feel . 
hands down , by far the absolute worst tasting tea i have ever had and i have allot ! i am an avid tea drinker and i just ca n't get it down the benefits are supposed to be amazing so i 'll keep it around to water down and sugar up but wow it 's bad so strong too , tastes like dirt \( that 's been pissed on in the woods \) . 
dandelion root is reported to aid in reducing high blood pressure , which is why i drink it i 've pretty much given up coffee drinking and this is a tasty substitute , though one must acquire a taste for it at home i use bulk roasted root but these tea bags are fantastic during travel . 
i really like this tea , i started drinking it at the suggestion of a friend br it helps to sooth an upset stomache i will be buying it again in the future . 
i love this brand of dandelion root tea the tea is so good for your health and keeps you regular transaction went smooth like always so glad to hear amazon may soon have home delivery of groceries to my door i have some disabilities that require someone to shop for me but i do a lot of it on amazon com . 
i love this tea and it makes you feel very healthy , which is so needed during the christmas and new year season i have n't used it in one week , and i can soooo feel my body needing a good detox i recommend for anyone who has stomach issues , over indulges , and wants to feel generally better . 
reveived my item fast ! it was exactly what i ordered in excellent shape with safe shipping i will came back and shop here again thanks . 
i drink this tea every day \( i'm 7 months pregnant \) , and have done so since i found out i was pregnant i love that it 's organic and contains all the herbs that support a healthy pregnancy i do n't notice anything dramatic when i drink it or do n't drink it , but i will say i feel nourished when i drink it , and have had no pregnancy complications whatsoever i'm 36 , this is my first pregnancy , and i have been exceptionally healthy throughout i highly recommend this for any pregnant woman at least a cup a day ! . 
as an avid tea drinker of all corners of the earth , i have had hundreds of teas , and everything from this company as well i read about this tea as a very powerful health herb but all the reviews said it tastes bad what do i care \? i 'd rather be healthy i never take sugar in my tea either if you 've read this far you are waiting for me to say how bad it was you ca n't imagine how bad it is without exaggeration i would describe the flavor as a very bitter tasting dirt yes , as a 32 year old with children i know what dirt tastes like and this tastes like dirt but with a super bitter taste that makes it hard to drink my recommendation is to let it steep for a shorter amount of time as to not make a rich bold tea as you know , the longer it steeps the bolder the tea becomes yea , do n't do that with this four stars because it is apparently very good for you and i thank the company for bringing it to us regardless of the taste of death when other tea companies are using artificial ingredients to make their teas taste better . 
i was pleasantly surprised by the stronger than i expected ginger flavor in this product it is excellent , if you like ginger , try this best on hot biscuits ! update i 've just reordered , wish they sold it by the gallon , its different , something you ca n't find locally and excellent . 
i love this tea ! both the green and white varieties are quite consistently fresh i have ordered this at least ten times from various internet sites i did n't realize how old and stale tea from the grocery store was until i had this brand for organic tea , it is quite reasonably priced they recommend using two tsp of loose tea per cup i use half that and it tastes great never , ever bitter ! very smooth tasting i highly recommend ! . 
was glad to find this procuct on line as it is not sold in stores around here found a jar at a grocery outlet and decided to give it a try sure glad i did i researched this company and they have been in business since 1898 this is the only preanut butter i really like it is made with peanuts with no sugar and chemicals added to make it taste better it does n't need to add anything , great product and seller was prompt and shipping was reasonable . 
this was a great mother 's day gift the packaging is unique , very artful , and well designed inside are different pouches for each of the wine a rita flavors the box is substantial it feels great wrapped up in wrapping paper also the wine a rita people had the foresight to put two different types of recipes on the box one for wine and one for hard alcohol brilliant move in my opinion my mom is not the biggest liquor drinker , so now she can make iced drinks with wine as the base rather than hard alcohol though other reviews state that they only received the drink pouches in a plastic bag , this was not the case for my purchase i will update this review if we tinker with the recipes . 
this is definitely a girl 's alcoholic slushy there are 6 different flavors , and you can use any wine you choose the package directions are for an entire blender of slush i have found that using a tablespoon or two at a time makes just enough for one person good stuff have not found anyone who does not like this product . 
i have tried all of the flavors and every one of them are all delicious ! they are great for parties and entertaining ! . 
this review is for the packaging and not the actual mix , since the mix is a very subjective thing and my taste my not match others and , some wrote about how poor the packaging was all i can say is with mine there is more than enough labeling , on the bags themselves and on the box there are instructions on how to granted the box is nothing heavy duty or special and the mix is in plain white bags , there are more than enough instructions to go by . 
i had tried these at a friends house and loved them , but could not find them anywhere i shop they are very good for parties or a weekend treat for you and the girls . 
i bought these and yes they do come in plastic bags with a label on each but also included was a five sided box that you can fold together that has a picture of each flavor , one on each side it makes a cute little colorful box , nice to give as a gift if you put it together . 
i 'd rate these as better than average but since i am not a fan of flavored coffees , i 'd only give them a 3 rating as to me they taste artificial and weird like all flavored coffees do the regular coffees were very good better than many i really liked the amazonia and the africana medium roasts , not so much the colombian the dark roast eclipse , mexican , and french roast were very good i made them into ice coffee , strong but not bitter i did n't care for the costa rican light roast , it had an artificial taste to me the house blend was good but nothing to write home about i hate decaf so i used that k cup to water my plants with , so as far as taste goes i have no idea but my plants perked up the chocolate raspberry went nicely into a chocolate cake batter in place of water and it was delicious if priced right i 'd buy them again . 
product was timely delivered as advertised there is a wonderful selection of coffees which my clients and i are currently enjoying will order again . 
love van houtte k cups the selections provided allow one to sample coffees from different regions as well as taste the flavored coffees without having to buy a complete box of each then , you can pick the ones you like buy that particular coffee great concept ! . 
this is very good coffee i have been purchaseing this coffee for a long time an as long as amazon carys tiis i will keep buy it i like the tast it has a nice chocolate tast to it . 
i love the subcription option at amazon and am using it to get this smooth and non bitter coffee ! i love it . 
i got this at a local discount store for 6 it has an excellent flavor and the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead if 5 was personal preference . 
my first package came damaged but the first rate customer service department replaced it quickly the orzo are delicious and easy to cook . 
i 've used this product in traditional risotto recipes , but it 's also excellent to use in things like chicken soup , makes a nice , creamy , thick soup base i'm still exploring other ways to use this wonderful product . 
i'm not sure why no one seems to like these very much ! they are pretty good to us i have n't had a problem with them falling apart and they 're easy to slice for toasting my son , \( who is the one on the gfcf diet \) , is extremely picky and suspicious of anything new , ate these muffins without hesitating i sometimes poke a hole in the middle and serve as a 'bagel' these are a regular staple in our house . 
if you need gluten free , non dairy and no egg , pickings are pretty slim br br if you use a really sharp serrated knife and work carefully , you can split them successfully br br great for mini pizzas ! . 
these are ok i like the sweet potato ones better and both have good fiber content . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b000ffry3g ener g foods english muffins , 15 1 ounce units \( pack of 6 \) a br br these are one of my favorite gluten free items and a regular item to keep on hand i take for lunch and toast and very filling and easy but cheaper than going to fast food places i use for mini pizzas , hamburg buns , bacon , egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast , chicken sandwiches , etc easy to take on trips or friends and family to eat must toast or bake for best favor . 
how can you go wrong with buying these in bulk for less than 3 per unit when they can run as high as 5 per unit retail \? . 
these are great we were told to stay away from wheat , barley and rye this is a good answer for us they a not pre cut so you have to cut them in to i recommend them . 
this product is very good but i have this feeling that it is rather highly priced i do n't know why gluten free products in general are very expensive when they are made from easily available ingredients people with gluten problem are not just eating healthy but are sick and should not be exploited i like the muffins particularly when they are toasted . 
tried this item liked it this item was cheaper to get than buying at the local store , easier to get and it has a longer shelf life than what i was getting around here driving 30 miles one way is local p s these can make great mini pizzas . 
dried berries , still with texture and the quintessential aroma pot roast is so much better with half a dozen berries flattened into the breadboard and scooped into the pickling mixture but in ten years , trying to find them gee so now i know to look for it on amazon . 
again , exactly what i ordered no fuss , no muss arrived on time pretty much an ideal transaction only thing that threw me was that i underestimated the quantity \( gallon baggie in the freezer , ftw \) . 
shipping was really good , and i got what i ordered on time will buy from again , alittle pricy but my little dog likes them . 
thanks to amazon for carrying this wonderful product my local grocery store no longer carries this product and generally promotes thier private label house brands br for those folks whom enjoy fettuccine alfredo , this product cant be beat br it is fast and very easy to prepare and a excellent italian pasta dinner can be ready in 30 minutes or less br for me , i do add some extra parm cheese to the mix , yet , that is personal preference br we really enjoy tossing in some boneless and skinless chicken , grilled , to add to the sauce and create our own chicken alfredo br thanks again to amazon and to mc cormicks for making this product availalbe br br chuck runzo , pittsburgh , pa . 
i love to eat pasta but totally clueless on how to make one saw this while at the grocery earlier , decided to try it , followed the instructions and viola one awesome dinner ! ! note i did add some parmesan and romano cheese to add more flavor . 
i went searching for charcoal dog biscuits after reading that they help with digestive gas and bad breath this appears to be only one of two brands on the market i have n't tried the other one \( i think it 's called sportmix \) because the other did not make a biscuit for small dogs my dog has been eating one a day and i ca n't say for sure whether or not they work she used to have really smell gas she has n't dropped a bomber like that in a while so maybe it 's due to the biscuits who knows \? she does like these biscuits very much , so i will surely buy them again . 
my 4yo cardigan welsh corgi loves these things , and when they stopped carrying them at petsmart , i had to go here for them they seem to be made of good ingredients , and they 're the right size for him plus , he loves them and that 's what 's important ! . 
i have a 7 year old scottish terrier who has some food allergies no wheat for my girl \) this treat is great for settleing an upset stomach and my dog looks forward to her charcoal bone treats . 
my dog loved these and i think they probably helped with his gas and dare i say his breath too . 
everyone here who 's tried exclusive energy has been surprised by its unique ability to pleasantly refresh ! br hope it will become more readily available . 
love the products , both the sugar free and the regular are great feel refreshed , absolutely no crash no after taste stopped drinking monster and full throttle and started drinking exclusive ! . 
most of the time , you want crackers because you want to get the dip or whatever topping into your mouth ! with these , you can have those snacks again without having to worry about the calorie content of your crackers ! br br they 're only 17 calories a slice , and each slice is about the size of a 3 x 5 notecard they 're delicate and have a nice easy crunch these ones in particular have a lower sodium content as well , versus the pesto and garlic ones \( they 're a bit higher in sodium content , over 200 mg per 3 slices \) br br it 's an excellent addition , no matter what diet you are on or if you 're not even on a diet ! i bring them to parties and everyone always asks what they are and where can they get them . 
i highly recommend these very tasty kavli thin crispbreads i wanted something different than just white bread for sandwiches i hate whole wheat i love rye i saw these , noticed the ingredients could n't get much simpler and gave them a try topped with cheese , or a sandwich spread or whatever you 'd like they 're very tasty i feel as full after 2 or 3 of these , topped of course , as i did with just white bread they 're nice and thin so it is n't like biting into anything hard just a nice crunch the flavor is n't strong at all it is very mild and nothing like a rye bread you might have purchased in the past then i noticed that they are only 20 calories per slice what 's not to love \? they taste good , they 're whole grain , they 're super low in calories , it 's no crunchier than a potato chip , and i feel satisfied while chewing and after eating them oh and they keep forever in the cupboard i definitely will be buying these for a long time \) . 
great alternative for those who ca n't eat wheat a little bland , but crunchy and crispy . 
as someone who suffers occasionally from digestive difficulties , these kavli crispy thins are among the few things that i can eat at such times i always keep these crackers around to add to soups however , there are also times when they are the only thing i can properly digest this is a great item to have around when having digestive difficulties associated with the flu or stress for me they work better than the bananas , rice , applesauce or toast of the brat diet used in relieving ibs these thin , easy to chew crackers are a really great product . 
based on other reviews , i tried these kavli products they 're great low fat snacks these are great with natural peanut butter and jelly between 2 br br recommended . 
kavli crispy thin crispbread is the right consistency for multiple uses the taste is fantastic it 's fresh and pleasant to eat kavli products are the best . 
my wife is on the low carb diet , well we are on the low carb diet which means small breakfast if you do not have time to make eggs and bacon it is hard to get the coffee down without peanut butter she says we have been using crackers like these kavli crispbreads to get down the peanut butter since before i can remember i think it was when dan and mary eads published protien power plan in the late 1990s many years ago we found these to be the best we could only find them in wegmans grocery store in ne pennsylvania , and now that the army has moved us \( again \) to fort knox , ky we can only find them at kroger recently we cannot seem to find them there either , so we order them they come fast , not broken , and they are fresh also , they are not any more costly to purchase online and pay for delivery than to waste time looking for them one note my wife hates opnening things , and we found the best way to do so with these is to cut off the end of the cellophane \( \? \) with scissors prevents cracks of this thin bread ! . 
i enjoy my kavli crispy thins so much and so often that i now order by the case besides being naturally low fat and naturally nutritious , kavli crisp thins are a great replacement for salty , fattening nachoes , and or pizza with crispy thins , you can make your own nachos by layering the crisps w chopped tomatoes , cheese , even ground meat pop 2 crisp thins w toppings in microwave , and you 've got your delicious nachos , \( or pizza \) i have crispy thins w melted cheese every morning great way to start the day no , i do n't work for kavli ! this is not an ad , but a truthful review also so nice and easy to be able to order kavli \( and just about everything \) via amazon . 
my wife like these better that the swedish version , wasa , as she finds the taste better and likes the thinness of the product we will buy again . 
wheat free , natural ingredients , easy to chew dry by itself but is good with coconut oil and or fruit spread . 
i have n't seen these on the shelf for a while now so decided to buy here , although 12 boxes is a lot they 're great with butter and honey have n't tried them with anything else br they 're very thin and fragile and so whatever you put on them will stand out but they still have a healthy taste . 
this crispbread is nice and thin great for those with more sensitive teeth br br i eat 3 of these in the morning for breakfast with smuckers sugar free jelly on them br guilt free and delicious br br you do have to be a little careful when spreading heavy stuff on them like peanut butter br if you press too hard they can break br br one thing you ca n't tell from the box is that there are actually 2 air tight packs in the box br br i'm currently eating these and the ryvita sesame rye crispbread br highly recommend both br br note i have lost 12 pounds by changing my diet but i give the most credit to 2 things rye crispbread replacing almost br all of the flour in my diet and drinking oolong tea which helps burn belly fat br you do need to exercise a little bit too . 
i love rye used to eat the thick rye crisps , but my old teeth just ca n't handle them anymore but i still love some crunch i also like to eat healthier and these crisp thins are whole grain and have more fiber than many bread options br br it was getting harder to find them locally so i started getting them here on amazon so i never have to be w o my favorite cracker ! another bonus i 've had these around the house for years but my kids never showed any interest \( just some weird thing mom ate \) until i ordered a whole box of them last month my last daughter still at home thought maybe she should try them since i bought so many now she 's hooked so she 's taking them off to college with her ! . 
i was looking forward to this order from amazon i 've been on a calorie restricted diet for months and it 's the taste of grains \( bread , chips , crackers \) that i miss the most i find these thin crispbreads from kavli to be the perfect solution they are ultra thin i mean they are thinner than you might think possible br br as soon as i saw the first one i was amazed it made it through the shipping process in one piece so far i have not come across a single broken cracker my next thought was well , as soon as i bite into it , the thing 's going to explode into a thousand tiny shards i was amazed when it held together and showed only a perfect half moon hole where my teeth had been these crackers really hold together nicely br br the flavor is very plain there is no seasoning , and very little salt they taste like the grains they are made from i have ordered a case of the garlic flavor and look forward to trying them i eat these with a generous spoonful of very low calorie pepper and eggplant spread that makes for a very low calorie snack i highly recommend these . 
i have been buying this delicious crispbread for many years , but for some reason it is no longer available in stores it 's an all rye product with only natural ingredients and is just a few calories per cracker because it 's so thin it does n't overwhelm the flavour of cheese or tapenade , which is my favourite thing to have with the crackers i thought maybe i 'd overdone it by buying two cases , but i'm already into the second box after just a week . 
i highly recommend this product ca n't beat the calorie count my favorite use is putting natural crunchy peanut butter and blackberry jam between two pieces also great with cheese healthy product . 
i discovered these when i moved to canada a few years back before this i had only experienced a thicker wasa crispbread and was a bit put off at first the feelings dissolved the first time i ate one of these with light laughing cow cheese they are a little more powdery than i 'd like , but they compliment most cheeses very well without overwhelming them . 
the title says it all if you want a cracker that does n't interfere with the flavor of what you 're topping it with , but also adds a delicate crunch , this is your cracker br br recently at a friends house we were having some various crackers with a little butter and when i asked what the first cracker was , i was presented with a box of kavli crispy thin crackers the only way i 've tried them so far is plain , buttered or with homemade cranberry jam and they 're hard to put down br br i was a little surprised to see the other reviews bringing up the healthful aspects of these crackers as the two main reasons i love them so much have nothing to do with anything other than what i want out of a cracker light , crispy texture and delicious flavor ! . 
hard to find on the store shelves does n't over power the flavors you put on it . 
i just tried this crackers and am so pleased they are very very thin but strong enough to hold a spread at only 16 calories per large cracker 3x5 inch size , you really can enjoy a nice treat for under 50 calories a wonderful find for those of us that try to eat healthy and with some control . 
product was as described it was shipped promptly and i will be consuming it as part of a medically supervised diet it is the only bread that i'm allowed . 
i discovered the kavli thin crackers in paris at marks spencer in 1980 and kavli has been since , my bread and i was happy , when we moved to the us in 1987 , to find them also here br br i can say that kavli has been an important part of helping me to keep my weight . 
it is very strong and pure ! you just need a little bit to get a great flavor helps with digestion but the smell is strong ! ! . 
so okay , i do n't do hot tea but this is a perfect loose leaf tea for iced tea am i an expert at ice tea \? no , but after moving to the south some 25 years ago , i have tasted lots of iced tea and this one makes as good as you can find anywhere i will say that most recipes i could find must have been for some cheap tea bags \( weak , somewhat tasteless and bitter \) , so i experimented a little and found a great recipe for this loose leaf tea the recipe is 1 4 cup tea to 8 cups water bring the water to a boil take it off the heat , put the tea in , let it steep for no more than 5 minutes and strain into a container , let cool to room temperature and refrigerate if you are in a hurry , fill a glass with ice and pour the tea over the ice this works great for this particular loose leaf tea not strong , not weak oh yes , if you like sweet tea , add the sugar to the container while the tea is hot . 
these are so tasty i use them when making my cheesecake cookies and in pancakes there 's nothing that they ca n't be used in they taste sweet and not overpowering . 
order these with the idea in mind of putting them in waffles , pancakes a cookiie recipe that i had . 
looking for bits as real blueberries seem to have no flavor these days these were very good , would def buy again . 
i buy gosh that 's good sugar free white velvet all of the time this is the best sf white chocolate that i have ever used it may be a little expensive but it lasts a long time buy it and enjoy ! . 
i have been looking at this product for a couple months and finally gave in first of all , the name got my interest ! the taste is delicious but i'm having problems with the directions ! have n't figured out if it 's actually a hot beverage or do you put it in a hot beverage \? ! \? ! \? ! \? ! \? it has a scoop \( small \) and says to put that in a cup \( instructions for 8 oz \) and then put a couple shots of hot water ! shots of water \? \? \? \? and you can add frothing milk hum ! confused but i guess i will work with it hope it does n't take the whole container \( very large \) to figure it out i would have given it 5 stars had i understood the instructions ! . 
this stuff is amazing ! fast shipping and most of all the best tasting sugar free low calorie item on the market bravo ! i use it in my coffee and its a real treat br br thank you ! will be ordering more very soon . 
wagyu beef is a kobe beef japanese cow crossbred with an american cow it 's the best possible beef you can get in the us and is not illegal . 
my youngest cat is very particular about what he eats he absolutely will not eat if something does n't meet his expectations between that and the recent pet food recalls , i 've had a really hard time finding cat food that i can feed him i'm happy to say that the merrick turducken clicks with him , plus it has no wheat gluten or other fillers the texture of it is appealing , too it 's not just mush or spam looking like many foods i 'll continue to buy turducken and plan to also try out some of the other merrick flavors . 
i open a can of this stuff , and it looks like real food i spoon it onto the dishes for my four , and it dishes like actual meat and sauce all four of them dive right into it , and all four saucers are licked clean br br i have seen the health benefits to my cats from feeding them high quality grain free food this turducken canned food is one of the staples of their diet i love feeding it to them , and they love eating it br br in my view , it 's worth the extra money to get really good food for one 's pets . 
really gets the mouth watering , a little over 3 00 at big5 , the price listed here is insane ! . 
this is a good deal for a flavor not often carried in the stores the honey berry flaver is a good thing , not being to mediciny and things of that nature yum . 
i 've used this bbq sauce before and it is good especially considering that is free of so many negatives \( like corn syrup and for us gluten \) but the price on this ca n't be right order directly from the daddy sam 's website to pay 5 50 19 oz bottle this price would have to be a case price although the description says 19oz . 
this was a cute , affordable set for my 2 y o son 's golf theme party they were a great size for a half sheet cake and he 's played with them as toys since his party . 
i only used one green with it 's ball , etc with the golfer on the cake i made one long hole with fairway , sand traps , water hazards and green my hubby loved it for his big 30th golf themed party i used the extra golf clubs , balls and pins on the decor table around the cake if i had a huge sheet cake to decorate i could see using the three greens but it would n't have fit right on one 9x13 cake knowing i was buying wilton made me confidant that i would be very satisfied and i was and for the price , i could n't go wrong \) . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b0000vmbdi wilton 13 pc golf set 1306 7274 a br br i am very happy with this product i purchased this item for my collages retirement celebration i have received numerous comments ! wow everyone wanted to know where i purchased these items of course i was proud to say amazon com i would suggest my friends to purchase this product from wilton as the price is very cheap and the quality is very good . 
the golf set arrived quickly and was just as pictured the birthday for my five year old grandson turned out great . 
the best sugar substitute at this time swerve is virtually replacing sugar in our home bakes and measures the same as sugar with no aftertaste ca n't wait for it to go mainstream to be able to buy in our supermarkets . 
i am absolutely amazed with the taste of this product i'm not too much of a fan of the caramel dip , but the syrup is equally as delicious as its pancake counterpart i highly recommend it , but ask your local grocers to see if they 're willing to carry it this is far too expensive than what i paid going to my grocery store . 
i feed my two pugs and occasional rescue newman 's advanced dog formula i like this better than the regular newman 's , because it has less ingredients i supplement with high quality can food , organic free range chicken , healthy powder and salmon oil my boys are healthy their coats are amazing highly recommend but with supplements see above . 
newman products have been used in our home for years after researching newman 's adult dog food i felt confident in giving the food to our two cocapoo 's they love it ! one of them wolfs it down in 4 seconds ! really , i timed it br with so many companies recalling dog foods , i felt the newman company being organic would be more reliable keeps me from worrying so much as i pour that bowl of food for them . 
this food is great my 11 year old beagle loves it and she is much more active since i changed her food i highly recommend this dog food . 
we have had trouble in finding dog food for one of our small dogs who obviously has a very sensitive stomach we have tried several kinds of dog food for her and newman 's own organic seems to be agreeing with her so we will continue purchasing this product through amazon as long as it does . 
love the fact that it is on subscribeand save the change to this food has had many benefits my dog loves it , has aided in the suppression of tear staining \( he 's part beagle , part king charles \) , and makes his poo firm . 
i was using organix for a while , and was happy with the ingredients , and my dog seemed to enjoy it then i saw all the great reviews for newman 's own organic dog food , along with the great price , and decided to give it a try br br they say that it takes a dog a while to get used to a new food , but i have to tell you from the first day i gave him the newman 's own , he refused to eat the organix anymore , he loved the newman 's own so much even though he 'd eaten the organix for years ! i even tried mixing the bit of organix i had left in with the newman 's own but he would just pick out the pieces and leave them on the floor next to his bowl br br so , i do n't know what it is , but my dog sure seems to love this food ! he 's eating more now and he 's very healthy br br again , i had no complaints about the organix i think it 's probably a good dog food but my dog sure prefers the newman 's own ! ! . 
i have a 11 yr old pomimo \( 1 2 pomeranian , 1 2 american eskimo \) who seems to only like human food although i 'd love to give him human food all the time , i know it 's not good for his digestive system , and it does n't have the proper nutrients required for a dog , especially at his current age upon trying various brands including blue and call of the wild , i could n't justify the price in comparison to how little my dog liked the taste after reading some positive reviews here on amazon for newman 's , i decided to give it a go surprisingly , my dog started eating the food immediately after i poured some into his dish he never does that with other dry dog food , and usually waits to eat after i 've given him a nibble of everything that i eat during the day what makes it even better is the reasonable price for the quality yes , i understand that organic and quality us made food are naturally more expensive , however some of the brands charge double of newman 's and provide only half the taste as humans , we 're usually sold by the nutritious wholesome advertisements when buying dog food , however i think its pretty important for my dog to actually like the taste of the food also newman 's seems to be the ticket for both nutrition and taste will be buying newman 's as a regular ! . 
we have been feeding our dog newman 's own since she was very young she was a finiky eater and i was a determined owner who insisted on organic food both of our needs were fulfilled when we found this great product it 's the only dog food that she has eaten and she is going to be 9 years old next month the only reason she ever has gone to the vet is for her shots i highly recommend this food i am sooo glad amazon carries it now because we had to drive quite a distance to buy it before at a organic pet shop . 
i'm very pleased with this dog food have n't ordered anything else for my dogs since i bought this my lab and my malti poo both eat it happily and i'm happy that it is healthy for them . 
i highly recommend newman 's own organics dog food natural , high is nutrition and with out fillers keep your dogs healthy and with lots of energy for a long time ! . 
it took for a week to waiting them to ship for the item but soooo pleased to myself and my dog \) thank you for the newman 's daughter to keeping an awesome company n' caring our pets ! ! ! ! 5 stars ! . 
i switched my dog to this food and watching him truly enjoy eating and the taste of his food is worth anything he has eaten precise foundation formula for the almost two years since i adopted him he often goes off his food and or vomits from time to time i 've tried switching him to wellness and blue buffalo with no positive results i ca n't tell you the immediate difference in him from the first time he ate the newman 's and he looks forward to every meal , does n't beg for other stuff because he is satisfied , and he seems to have more energy he is a 110 lb great pyrenees and finally very happy with his food . 
we have two westies who , to say the least , have very sensitive digestion systems since using this product , their hair is soft and moisturized , they love their food , and to boot , they are down to their recommended weight we 're on the automatic delivery program and that 's the best no brainer ever . 
the ingredients are really wholesome and , fast delivery ! br it would be nice if they had some type of fish formula though br but my dog loves them and will buy again ! . 
we switched to this brand because one of our dog 's eyes always teared , and someone said it could be from a corn allergy this is one of only a few brands that is corn free and it cured the teary eye problem quickly blue brand does not contain corn , but they include garlic in their blend which can cause kidney problems in dogs over time according the veteriniarian it smells more natural than purina one which i had been feeding them and they seem to like it better i like that the sales from the food go to charity too a good product . 
we 've originally bought this as our dog 's first food and then switched to wellness dog had runs for a few weeks hoping it would go away then went back to newman 's own and now our dog feels a lot better never switched his food ever again . 
this brand is the lowest price i can find in organic dog kibbles the subscription is convenient i wish the company makes 50 pound bags . 
we have been using this product for over a year now , goldie our dog loves it , she is 15 years old now . 
i have two english bull terrier with bad allergies one of which is very picky and quickly stopped eating any type of dog food that i bought they have been eating newman 's advanced dog formula for active or senior dogs for 18 months now and have not tired of it their skin and mobility has improved and they love it i buy it by subscription so we never have to worry about running out and it is the cheaper way to purchase my local stores only sell small bags which is an expensive way to buy . 
received in a timely manner and in good condition my mishka is a little spoiled \( i cook her meals when i can afford it , buy her wellness kibble when i ca n't \) but she ate this willingly i bought this because it qualified for overnight shipping , unlike the much heavier wellness bag , and she was almost out of kibble i'm happy with the compromise . 
i buy newmans own adult dog food for my two chihuahuas i 've always fed them natural , human grade dog food , even though most brands can be a bit pricey like most pet parents , i try to do the best i can for my dogs which starts with feeding them right most dog food can be disgusting and the practices behind it are disturbing newmans own is more affordable , and i feel good about the company 's ethics and practices so it was worth a try br br my dogs love it so it was easy to switch from the other brand they gobble it up ! i now have it on subscription so we do n't run out . 
4 year old elkhound loves this food , and it keeps her in great health amazon has the best price i 've found for this food , and it 's even better with subscribe and save i highly recommend it . 
great alternative to dog food with corn and other by products our picky dogs enjoy this food and so do i , knowing br it is better their health . 
i feel good about the quality and mix it with canned pn food she does n't care for it by itself but then she does n't like any dry dogfood . 
one of the best for our 11 year old jack russell mix br i always check to make the first ingredient is meat or chicken , not a byproduct . 
i have 4 adult shih tzus and while they do prefer it when i cook for them they do eat this and it has helped eliminate the brownish tear stains they get when i feed them some dry foods . 
i read all the reviews before buying this food and overall i was impressed with the product myself the dogs like it , they have no ill effects as 1 reviewer alleged \( looking at her other reviews i think hers should be tossed by amazon \) and i can get it for even less on a subscription with prime which means 2 day no cost shipping whats not to love \? i do mix this with some prescription diet j d since i have one older' dog and 1 with some allergies and the combo seems to help bottom line it is a good product and after doing a ton of reading \( i do n't buy my animals cheap food or anything that i think comes from china \) i think it does everything it claims . 
my yorkiepoo thrives on this dog food i ran out two weeks ago , no local source , bought a competitor 's so called equivalent only to see my quinn suffer from itching and belly aches i ordered this from amazon yesterday , free shipping , they sent it out hours later and i recieved it today ! . 
my tibetin terrior is 3 years old and has been on wellness food since birth i just recently found newman 's own organics br the price was a bit cheaper , plus free shipping to my home ! awesome ! when i started to gradually change foods my livi , br would eat only the newmans' and leave the wellness to later when she was really hungry so funny ! she is the queen and she knows it ! ! . 
i do n't know why , because it does n't look very appetizing , but my two dachshunds love this stuff and scarf it down with great abandon . 
i have been using the product for several months now the dogs seem to like it and having it delivered is really nice what more can i say \? . 
hello , i have tried some different foods for my dog , but this is the one she tolerates the best i have a 13 year old border collie lab mix and have been giving her this food for quite some time now she loves it thank you . 
the auto ship is a terrific way to get hard to find dog food like newman 's i can t find it in my area at all , and it is all my elderly dog can eat with her ibs and preservative sensitivities br easy and cost effective i only wrestle with the co2 footprint on having it to be shipped \( \( and am working on finding an offset for that ! ! \) . 
i feed my 10 year old toy breed this food and she has n't complained yet was feeding her eukanuba her whole life before the dog food scare switched then to only organic brands like wellness this product has been the best deal on organic dog food i have found and with the subscribe and save perfect ! ! . 
this is a great product very comforting for owners that it is all natural \( and mostly organic \) with no by products and preservatives br br we gave our dog \( a 7 year old lab mix \) petpromise before after the transition it took a couple of days for her to get used to it , but once she did she loves it my dog is quite picky about her food and she likes junk food better rather than wholesome food and treats \( of course ! \) she is very used to newman 's own now and it gives her very good bowl movement always a plus ! . 
i adopted a rescue dog who had an allergy to corn i checked every bag in local stores but all main fillers were corn i thought i would have to drive to nearest pet store \( 120 mile round trip \) to find a corn free dog food then i found this brand on amazon which listed all the ingretents no corn ! my dog loves it so much , i even use it as a trick when training her i 'll be buying again and again . 
my dog never met a meal she did n't love including this one the price is very good , especially utilizing the subscription option i make 2 3 of the food i feed my dog , it 's very easy and economical and the best way to control the quality . 
very high quality food that my dog will actually eat always ships promptly and well packaged . 
i 've always given my dog what i thought was high quality dog food since she was a puppy after the pet food issues of a few years ago i switched to only organic dog food for her since she is only 10 lbs the price difference is n't too bad i am a free feeder which is n't ideal but means my dog basically has access to food any time she wants it because of this she only gets really excited when people food is offered to her well when i open this bag she comes over and eats asap good enough for me ! . 
yayy ! ! ! not feeling well today and dreading having to go to grocery store but the one thing i cannot do without is dog food \( love my dogs \) low and behold , the door bell rang and it was like santa heard me i ca n't believe how quickly my order came i was so happy i posted on facebook , and text to my mother thank you amazon \) thank you prime ! ! ! . 
i tried many different types of dry food for my picky eater , a cavalier king charles spaniel when i found the newmans own i hit gold my dog loves it , he licks his bowl clean , and best of all it is good for him his coat looks very healthy and his intermittent stomach issues are controlled i am really happy with this brand i wish it was available at more stores . 
i have started buying a lot of organic food over the past year , and it dawned on me that perhaps my dog should be eating more healthfully also when i look at the list of ingredients on regular dog food , it is downright nauseating ! i bought some of this newman 's own and my dog loves it she usually gobbles it up the minute i put it into the bowl . 
this large bag of dry pet food is highly recommended for you adult dog it 's also worth purchasing this larger sized bag \( or get two of them at once \) in order to stock up on this food for a greater length of time . 
my dogs love it , even the little princess terrier i 've tried many other brands and they enjoy this one the most as so far . 
fast delivery product arrived exactly as described would purchase again from this company . 
i believe that dog food should be what your dog likes to start with br br next , i think that you should do research to make sure it is right for br br your pooch ! ! ! all human grade products go into the dog food , another br br decision is the size , and for 14 lbs a 7 pound bag is perfect ! ! ! buying br br at amazon is a great way to buy , because they have the 7 pounder ! ! ! . 
i rotate between newmans , nature balance , and ceasar milans organic dog food my dog eat 's all three so ca n't say which is better my main reason to purchase this brand \( or any newman product \) is for the charity the profits goes to my way of supporting companies that give back . 
i signed up for the monthly subscription for this item the price is great especially without having to pay shipping charges i love the fact that i can manage the subscription by skipping a month or ordering it earlier than scheduled amazon has been excellent getting my shipments out on a timely manner a href http www amazon com gp product b000vk33c6 newman 's own organics adult dog food chicken rice formula , 7 pound bag a very pleased with all my orders from amazon extremely pleased with their customer service ! thanks amazon ! . 
just signed up for the subscribe and save option saved a few bucks per bag versus the local store , and now it will show up every month hopefully the rhythm will match the consumption rate of my two dogs ! \( the shortest shipping interval is 1 month , but you can trigger an immediate delivery if needed \) . 
i put this in my dogs bowl and the first time , my dog , bob saget , just licked the bowl clean same ol same ol then ! i put in some uranium ore and bamy waowi he turned green ! ! ! good results the next day his eyes startes to glow and , when i took him for his daily stroll he looked at the neighbors cat and it levitated and exploded good results br i think i 'll try some my i have a few people that the world dose n't need \) . 
i cannot express enough how pleased i am with this dog food i feed my 11 year old german shepard , and my two year old pittie girl this food every day , and the benefits are astounding for most of my shepards life i fed her a well known , vet recommended food , and yet she always had stomach problems trying many things , it was not until i rescued , and i should really say she rescued me , and the dog food recall , that i began doing research on brands of food after a long investigation , i decided on newman 's own , not only because there had been no recall on the food , but because of the ingredients , and that the proceeds going to charity now , choosing this brand , would mean that i would have to order it online , because my local stores did not carry it , but that was all right with me , because not only do i enjoy online ordering , but i am an older , disabled woman , and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me well , i want to tell you , my 11 year old thrives on this food , with no more digestive issues , and a beautiful white coat , and she loves eating it with vigor my two year old american pit bull terrier , another love of my life , also thrives on this food , has the most beautiful shiny coat ever , and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is i do spoil my fur kids , but their health and well being is my number one priority i have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats newman 's own cat food , both dry and canned food , and since then , i have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair balls i know that i am truly a pet lover , but i believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them , unnecessary medical issues , and all around good health , a good balanced , safe , natural food is the way to go i highly recommend newman 's own dog and cat food i also feed my two dogs newman 's own biscuits as treats . 
i adopted a dog that was raised by a bunch of frat age boys you can imagine the diet she had burgers , fries , ice cream , and the cheapest dog foods on the market br br no , she was n't crazy about newman 's dog food when i switched her to it but if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense it takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there br br it has been almost a year my dog , molly , is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free she gets dry newman 's fed free style , and 4 ounces of newman 's canned every day her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week br br on another note , this diet has made doggy duty much easier she never vomits anymore her scat is always firm , making her easy to clean up after she is regular as clock work all these plusses make it more enjoyable to be a dog owner . 
our dog is 13 years old and for the last couple of years , his stomach has become particularly sensitive we tried various brands of dog food before settling on newman 's own our dog loves it and has not had any more trouble with his stomach it is hard to find though i was buying it from a small local organic grocery store but they only carried it in the smallest size and i was paying almost twice as much as on amazon now i have it set up on amazon to ship monthly . 
i 've yet to find any of the dogs i know that love it i still have my allergic dog eating it , but she has to be hungry to eat this without doctoring my vet does n't want me feeding her people food so i add some of newman 's or happy hips canned to it br br i 've talked to a couple of vets about prescription diet and they all push the big company brand names the common objection appears to be the soy used in newman 's to increase the protein count br br i am willing to put a little flavor in this to feed may dog high quality , social responsible food br br i may be the only person who has made the following mistake but , assuming you catch the amazon sales , make sure you are ordering the bag size you want i thought i was getting a good price on one order until the food came and it was the seven instead of twelve pound bag . 
i originally bought this as a replacement for science diet 's i d as it was always much more expensive than anything else out there i d was also more expensive than newman 's at my local vet 's office i have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past we tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red we found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her milkbone treats we needed something organic without a lot of beef in it while this one does have some bi product for protein , it does n't seem to bother my dog at all she also has normal stools every time which was n't the case even with the i d my dog hated the i d she would often leave a good portion of it on the ground or in the bowl and rarely ate it in its entirety with the newman 's own it is night and day she scarfs it down in less than a couple minutes and usually eats a bowl in one sitting it seems like she loves it from the way she eats it br br a couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem i had with other dog foods i gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now my husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems with br br on a side note , i wish newman 's offered a bigger size bag i have to order these all the time due to the 12 5 pound bag my husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size it still works out being cheaper than the 50 bag of 17 pound i d i was ordering so i'm still happy with it science diet was sending me to the poor house . 
i adopted my dog about 6 months ago and he had digestive problems that the vet could find no cause for he would get diarrhea with mucous in stools regularly his stools would vary from constipated to unformed soft stool i decided to switch him to a better quality food and did a lot of research newman 's own had all the qualities i was looking for , so i switched him to it gradually 1 2 purina one and 1 2 newman 's own at first and gradually more newmans' own in the mix until finally 100 n o ever since switching about six weeks ago , he has not had constipation or loose stools i also do n't hear his tummy roiling after meals like before and despite what a few reviewers have written , the chicken and beef used in the pet food , while not organic , is natural and raised without hormones and antibiotics br br according to ingredients list natural chicken raised without growth hormones and antibiotics and fed only a 100 natural , all vegetable diet , the chicken meat provides amino acids essential for muscles , hormones , enzymes , antibodies and structural and protective tissues also , the beef is free range anad range fed w no hormones antibiotics br br for me the evidence is clear this is good quality food , my dog loves it and i love that when i buy newman 's own products , the royalties go to charity ! . 
i subscribe to the 12 5 lb bag of advanced dog formula for active or senior dogs it 's a great value we have a small border collie mix and she absolutely loves this food i feed it to her in a a href http www amazon com gp product b0006g54ou buster food cube large size \( colors may vary \) a and she ca n't wait for mealtime every day ! br br we got her from the shelter where she was on science diet she had a ton of skin issues \( formerly had fleas , patches of bare skin , itchy dry skin , and dandruff flakes \) since we changed over to newman 's , the skin problems have almost gone away it 's been about 2 months and she has her fur growing back in the problem areas , she has less dandruff and i 've noticed a lot less scratching from her in general our dog trainer said it was most likely due to the change in diet br br her bms are solid and very regular they are also not particularly smelly i have never smelled any gas from her since putting her on the food these are all signs that she is on a great diet ! br br also , i love the subscribe feature because i do n't have to lug heavy bags of dog food from my car to my 3rd floor apartment ! . 
we have a pug that suffers from chronic ear infections and skin problems we 've consistently kept him on expensive brands that are well known for having good ingredients like california natural , chicken soup for the dog lover 's soul , royal canin , and a couple others that i ca n't remember off the top of my head br br my mom picked up this newman 's food because it was available at the grocery store they love the food , but what really surprises me is that his ears and skin have improved dramatically his stools are also much firmer and way less stinky than before this food seems like a real winner for us . 
since we began using this several years ago our senior dogs raely need to visit the vet when we were feeding a well know premium petstore brand we were there at least 1 time every six weeks they love the taste of newmans it keeps their tummy in tip top shape no more food alergies no more vomiting , made with bells evans chicken the same chicken sold at whole foods other organic food sellers if its good enough for you , it 's good enough for them all mr newmans profits go to animal shelter and rescue organization give this food 12 weeks see the improvememnt yourself . 
our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old , and the solid gold food i 'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago \( with no notice on the packaging \) , and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets after the contaminated food scare even tho solid gold was not recalled , i decided to switch , and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight newman 's own is a brand i totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years after a year on this food , my dog is doing fine , but i do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat that may be age related as well but the stomach upsets have stopped and i feel better knowing i am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula . 
i switched my mini schauzers over to newman 's own organics a month ago when they came off of their puppy chow i 've been looking for a good quality dog food \( rated 4 stars by dogfoodadvisor com \) without going into debt purchasing it ! i was feeding them a different brand that was breed specific food , but was having trouble trying to find it in stock anywhere a few places , if they carried it at all , only carried the very small bags \( 2 5 lbs \) and with two dogs , one bag would last about 3 5 days plus these little 2 5 lb bags cost more than half what the larger 10 lb bag cost ! i tried to make an arrangement to have one of the places order the larger bag for me , but they conveniently forgot to place the order , so i was stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags then i heard about newman 's own organics , which is rated a better dog food than the breed specific food i was using and cost less ! and then i discovered that i could buy this food at amazon com , have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for signing up for the subscription plan delivery no brainer ! ! no more running out of food , no more driving 50 miles or more to find it , no more hassels ! br br and best and most importantly of all , my little guys love it ! ! their stools firmed up almost immediately after starting the switchover , they seem more active , more alert , more regular and they actually chew this food \( they inhaled their puppy chow without chewing ! \) i ca n't say enough good things about both newman 's own and amazon 's subscription delivery service ! . 
i have a dachshund i have fed her newman 's own senior formula for the past few years i used to feed her eukanuba , but then when there was that pet food scare with china , i started to investigate and found out that eukanuba contained the same undesirable chicken parts as the cheaper dog foods i was n't happy i contacted newman 's about whether the products in this food are sourced from the u s and i was told by one of their scientists that they are recently , i moved and was unable to get newman 's locally , so i tried a couple other organic brands my dog did n't like them and she seemed to have a larger stool i decided to go back to newman 's and order from amazon , who i can always count on to carry everything now she 's happy and so am i ! and , we 're supporting a great cause , because newman 's does n't compromise on quality and also supports charitable endeavors what more could you ask \? br br one important thing to consider if you have a senior dog , it is important to feed them the senior formula so they can digest the food easier . 
i had been buying all sorts of super premium , super expensive foods my local stores kept discontinuing them so i did my research and found newman 's own organic br br it is certified organic with no hormones , antibiotics or chemical additives , corn or wheat br br and my dogs love it \( of course they eat anything including grass and bird food and several unfit to post on line \) . 
this food is a vast improvement over the store bought crap my dog 's coat got softer within days , his breath stopped stinking immediately and he smells a lot better he is more active and seems healthier and happier no more rendering plant floor sweepings for my dog ! 20 a month is a small sacrifice to make for my dog 's health and well being i honestly do n't know why everyone is n't more concerned about what kind of inedible junk they put in regular store bought dog food . 
one of my dogs had irritable bowel syndrome which we tried to address with food from the vet , raw food , and every kind of dog food in a pet store a friend told me about newmans and how it cleared up her dog 's stomach problems one day later firm stools , no gas , happy dog , ecstatic dog parents ! my other dog is 10 and is often mistaken for a puppy due to her good energy and coat i am so glad we found this food ! . 
i have given my dogs every expensive dog food there is , orijin , blu , merrick you name it , and even though they were good this one is the best no upset tummies during the switch to this dog food either even my senior dog who always has loose stool now has a firm healthy stool plus , newman 's own gives all their profits to charity so it really is the best as far as i'm concerned . 
my foster dog , rex , came to me severely underweight with nutrient defficiencies and digestive issues after a few weeks of prescription food , i phased him into newman 's own advanced formula not only does he love it , but he 's gaining weight marvelously and digests it easily it was recommended by many , and has minimal to no fillers br br personally , i enjoy the product because as a life long vegetarian , it was important to find a food with strict animal compassion practices , and newman 's own apparently has those it 's affordable as well sticking with it ! . 
this is a great dog food product healthy , organic and great for sensitive tummies ! br br our lhasa apso is nine years old , is a picky eater and has a very sensitive stomach we started feeding him newman 's own organics dog food about 4 years ago and are really , really satified with this product he rarely gets sick , eats almost every meal we give him , though sometimes he makes us wait for him to finish his breakfast but that 's okay ! with other dog food products he would stop eating them completely or get sick frequently even the expensive brands we tried from the animal hospital br br at first the only place we could buy newman 's own was from a local , privately owned pet store which was very expensive but worth it since he stopped getting sick so frequently i was delighted to buy it on amazon the price for the 12 5 lb bag is slightly more than what we were paying for the 7 lb bag locally i am a prime member so was able to get this without paying for shipping i will certainly order it again when we get close to running out br br thank you amazon ! ! . 
my dogs love this food i have fed my 11 year old german shepard and my three year old american pit bull terrier for almost three years they have thrived so well on this food , my shepard no longer has stomach problems both their coats are beautiful and i am completely satisfied when i decided to switch foods , i did alot of research on what good , healthy , mostly organic food to switch them to i chose newman 's own , not because i could purchase it easily at a local store because i can not do so , i have to order it and have it delivered , but because of the ingredients , how it is made , and because most of the proceeds go to charities i found the best price at amazon , and will always order it this way i truly recommend this dog food to everyone . 
i have not tried this product personally , but my dog has , and he loves it , and is aging well he 's getting a bit grey , but is as bouncy as he ever was 10 years ago . 
have two cocker spaniels br it was a challenge to find the right dog food for br the older one , as he would get very gassy i tried br at least 5 6 different brands with no success then br another cocker spaniel owner recommended me this one br no more gas ! ! br both of them love it their coat is looking so much br shinier and healthier and they now shed very less br i would'nt feed my dogs anything else now br very highly recommended ! br and the price and service from amazon is unbeatable ! ! . 
our dog has always been a little on the lazy side , and his coat has been fairly unhealthy looking relative to other dogs we 've had in the past when he began to start smelling on top of it , we decided to change his dog food to see if perhaps his stomach was becoming upset by his current food br br after about a week on the new food , he had noticeably more energy and his coat started to become much healthier on top of that , the odor that he emitted started to subside until it was no longer there br br we really did n't expect it to be so drastic we 're very happy with newman 's own dog food . 
i have three dog friends maggie , my 14 year old aussie had some problems \( 2 , 000 00 \) worth of problems and she was so sick i thought of putting her down as it turns out there were several issues that the colo springs emergi vet and dr jaime gaynor fixed and one of them one food allergies that had caused severe problems after trying several foods and making all my own dog food we tried paul newman and all was well , maggie and her friends thrived well our grocery stores did not always have it in stock and it ranged from 13 to 17 dollars for 7 pounds , also at wal mart is was past its expiration date and rancid thank you amazon , it comes fresh ! it is so reasonably priced and it gets delivered on schedule which i can change at anytime as far as amount and delivery date i cannot thank you enough for carrying this food nor recommend it enough for other dogs our lives are busy , i am a nurse and anything that is dependable , easy , reasonable , comes with excellent customer service , and my friends maggie , lucy , and honey stay healthy on it a gift for every day , thank you . 
i was a little skeptical about switching over to this brand but i'm happy to say , my dog loves this stuff i do n't even need to add leftover meat scraps or gravy sauce like i did to his old food this stuff is way better than the crap they sell at those chain stores ca n't beat the price with s s ! also love that they come in smaller resealable bags which keeps the food fresh better to open up a brand new bag every couple weeks than to leave a huge opened bag of kibble in the pantry for months . 
prior to switching to newman 's own organics dog food , my 4 year old shih tzu was crunching on iams which was fine , except that every 2 3 months or so he 'd have stomach problems after switching , his poops have been firmer , no stomach issues in sight , and his coat has gotten glossier \( and much less flaky \) duncan likes his new food and so do i ! . 
my cocker puppy 4 mos threw up castor and poullex and natural balance and had loose motions so i tried this and he did great ! even the red streaking from his eyes have almost cleared up after a month along with similasan eye drops which is great . 
i like newman 's own for my family due to its consistent quality and good ingredients i like have the opportunity to provide the same quality products to my animals amazon makes it convenient to get multiple bags in manageable sizes that appear on my front porch according to my schedule i got the three four pound bags talk about portability and storability ! . 
my new yorkie came from a puppy mill she was clean and well groomed she was not ever in a house when i got her home she was so scared and nervous from the strange surroundings she would not eat or drink and had horrible watery mucous bowel movements after a visit to the vet that showed no parasites we put on the bland diet i researched organic dog food and was very impressed with the reviews of this food no one in my area , lancaster pa has this product i sent for it and weaned her off the bland diet after only two days on this food her poops are solid small and firm i am so thankful she is really doing well and she is a very sweet girl and looks at me with grateful brown eyes . 
dogs love the taste and i love the company especially convenient to have it delivered rather than me lugging it home . 
we switched up from nutro chicken and rice to newmans own and chip 's bowel movements are so much more dense and compact our vet says its a sign of good food nuff said . 
my 3 dogs love this food and are thriving on it ingredients are high quality and amazon price is better than anywhere i can get it except on sale . 
i have been feeding this to my standard poodle for quite some time it was recommended by a local dog day care grooming training center called great dog shoppe in seattle they are very specific about which foods they suggest and sell it must meet certain standards of nutrition or it 's no go my poodle loves it , but even better , i offered some to my cousin 's finicky poodle who just does n't eat when she 's away from home she gobbled it right up and asked for more when i compared the contents of newman 's to her brand \( which was suggested by a breeder \) there was no comparison newman 's own is far superior i get it via subscribe and save so i never run out , i save over the store price and it 's delivered right to my door what could be easier \? . 
i used to buy this at a local health food store and then they stopped carrying it then i was thrilled when i found it wal mart , but then they stopped stocking the dry kibble and now only carry the newman 's doggie mush in cans so , i could n't believe it when i found it here amazon really does sell just about everything ! my shih tzus like it and they do not get sick at all like they did periodically on the non organic but still expensive , vet recommended , brands . 
human grade chicken , all organic dog food the food is delivered to me monthly on schedule via the subscribe save program the profits benefit pet charities br what 's not to like \? . 
our dog loves this food ! he was having serious gastrointestinal problems that were n't clearing up until we started him on newman 's own since then , he has been regular , happy , and healthy . 
i have a 10 year old aussie shep heeler mix with chronic skin allergies i tried him on every premium dog food including grain free protein only formulas and none helped other organic dog food also make him itch miserably but on the newman 's own he 's stopped the itching and shedding , and he absolutely devours this stuff love it ! ! ! ! . 
i am very happy i switched from a very popular dog food , sold in a lot of vets offices to newmans about 3 years ago after a bout of stomach distress all has been well with my fur baby ever since \) and to have it brought right to my front door for cheaper than i can get it at the local store , how can you beat that \? . 
i , like most people , switched to organic after the dog food scare and after trying a lot of different foods , settled on this one my dogs like it and i feel good about it feeding it to them . 
the dogs had been eating purina for a long , long time i switched to newman 's own and i noticed something only a dog owner would be conscious of the waste they no longer expel foul odorous waste , which purina seemed to do to them regularly since they 've been on newman 's , their waste is almost odorless and , well it is easy to pick up you can tell it 's nutritious by what comes out , and if you have to pick up after your dog daily , like myself , you 'll appreciate the cleaner output . 
my goldendoodle is picky and likes to change up his food once in a while so i decided to try two other brands what a mistake br newman 's own is really the best my dog looks better , feels better , and the quality of food is very good do not do like i did and experiment around my poor dogs stomach stick with newmans . 
i switched to this food from blue buffalo i hate to say it , but around the time blue started doing tv commercials the food started upsetting my dog 's stomach perhaps that 's a coincidence , but it was a reason to switch regardless of the timing the newman 's food has been great my dog loves the food he has been energetic and in great health not much more that you could ask the bag of treats that comes in the 12 5 lb bag is a fantastic bonus to every bag . 
i rescued my dog a year ago ever since then , i 've been feeding him newman 's i like that the main ingredient is a form of meat and there is n't a lot of grain type of ingredients all of the ingredients are organic , so it 's really good for my dog i 've tried several other brands with my dog but i do n't think he 's really allergic to anything or has a distaste for anything in particular and since this is one of the cheaper brands out there that is still nutritious , i decided to stick to this brand ordering it on amazon is very convenient because i can use the subscribe save feature and set the schedule of when i want the dog food delivered i never have to worry about running out of dog food ! . 
i bought this for my miniature schnauzer who is about 17 pounds and i feed her a heaping cup everyday also sprinkled on top is glucosamine pills a href http www amazon com gp product b00028zll8 nutramax cosequin regular strength capsules 180 count a , to help with joint health i purchased this brand of dog food for my 7 year old mini schnauzer based on the reviews alone she never has had any digestive problems or issues and also is n't a very picky eater so i cannot attest to these two things her stool is firm is easy to pick up from eating this dog food and i have not had any issues with her having diarrhea or runny stool she has been on newman 's own organic dog food for about 6 months and i plan to keep feeding her this br br if you want your dog to have a healthy and long life , you will want to feed them the best like this organic dog food try avoiding feeding table scraps and make sure they have plenty of exercise br br make sure you sign up for subscribe and save for that extra 15 off br br edit 04 10 2012 br br edited to say that amazon now only has 5 off for subscribe and save also the latest bag i received also came with a full size sample bag of treats a href http www amazon com gp product b0045xe32e newman 's own organics lamb and barley new zealand ranch style dog treats , 10 ounce \( pack of 6 \) a it sells for 23 for 6 on amazon ! . 
my chiweenie was having issues with dandruff , constipation and a dull coat we researched different dog foods and bought newmans own for active or senior dogs in about 3 weeks , its like having a brand new dog he is so soft , dandruff free , having healthy 'movements' \) and he loves the food i can give him a piece of it as a treat and he really thinks it is , ha ha moral of the story , we will never go back to bargain brand for just a little bit more our dog is healthier , softer , happier and its worth it . 
my dog 's love it made from excellent ingredients and a great price at amazon com my chihuahua has allergies and i 've noticed she is n't scratching or chewing on her paws anymore . 
it 's all organic and it 's on peta 's \( people for the ethical treatment of animals \) list of cruelty free brands did you know that the leading brands of dog foods conduct horrible and cruel tests on laboratory dogs \? plus it is delivered to my door and no shipping charge \( super saver shipping \) , and costs less than the product i used to buy , saving me time and money oh yeah , and my dogs love it ! br br a href http www amazon com gp product b00139tt72 newman 's own organics adult dog food formula , 12 5 pound bag a . 
i have a two year old jack russell terrier and she loves newman 's own dog food ! she ate beneful for a year before switching this goes down much easier she does n't each eat it just because she 's hungry she actually likes it ! i highly recommend this product and would consider giving any dog nothing less ! . 
my dog loves it and she does n't scratch at her ears anymore \( she used to scratch her ears all the time because she kept an ear infection ! \) . 
my two small dogs took to the food immediately so well in fact i have had to move up the subscription for the 12 pound bag since they are young its not immediate if they look healthier or bouncier as they seem to be that way all the time what i have noticed is there business is allot more controlled and any problems such as regurgitation which i had in past products have gone away if your a prime member i would suggest setting up a subscription and be rid of of the chore of last minute runs to buy dog food and also know you are giving your pets a quality tier of dog food . 
this is going to be short and sweet my little \( 10 13 lbs \) dogs love it , easy to eat small bits , and it 's a high grade food souce for them what more can i say . 
i have been feeding this to my 13 yr old beagle for years newman 's own is of excellent quality and it 's certified organic also , a large portion of sales are donated to charity . 
the best dog food ever for my dog he has a sensitive stomach and not only does he love it but it totaly agrees with him my vet also feels it 's a great product even my dogs teeth are cleaner since being on it . 
newman 's own has been an excellent choice for my dog the ingredients are organic and high quality her coat is beautifully conditioned and she has never had an allergic response as with some of the more expensive products from the vet 's office also , she is a small dog and the kibble bits are easy for her to chew it was annoying that the price was reduced between the time of my order and the delivery , but amazon made an immediate adjustment i like the 4 pound bags for freshness because my dog is small and takes awhile to eat that much , but there are other sizes available to suit larger dogs . 
i have a 3 year old boston terrier who is not only a picky eater , but most dog foods give him bad gas i searched high and low for several months for a dog food that would help with his stomach issues and finally found another brand of dog food that , while not organic , helped relieve the gas problem br after finishing a bag of the old brand , i stumbled across this on amazon one cold day and thought i 'd take a chance and see if he 'd like it or not i'm happy to report that he loves it and it does n't give him horrible gas at all his coat is shiny and healthy , as well the only downside i can see like the other brand is the price but being that the product is high quality and organic , i ca n't argue that too much plus , with amazon 's subscribe and save , i get it at a discount and delivered right to my front door you definitely ca n't beat that ! br overall , i'm very satisfied with this and will continue to purchase . 
my dog loved this food and he was a very picky eater i felt i was giving him healthy food with no fillers i also loved the convinence of having it sent to the house monthly not having to shop and drag a big weightly item home was great . 
my dogs give this a high five i 've never tried it , but the list of ingredients is sound and it make their tails wag . 
one of my dogs is allergic to almost everything in dog food newman 's own for senior dogs makes all the difference in her health . 
i bought this dog food initally because i like everything that i have tried from newmans products for humans so , i thought that my pug , chloe may like newmans also well , she sure does , there is no turning up her nose at it i get it delivered regualry , so this negates the need to make a special trip to get dog food br br update 6 12 15 the last two bags i recieved had a mite in the foods which caused my dog to have severe bouts of diarrhea i only found out today when i took her to the vet , and was informed that these intestinal bugs were usually located in the dog food sure enough , when i got home and looked in the dog food , guess what i cfound on the bottom of the bag , tiny mites it went out into the garbage containers br br i will return to this dog food in a few months she ahs liked it so much , but will wait for a bit . 
my doogie loves it a lot , my budget howls though i ca n't find it steadily at the local stores so catching it on sale is out of the question it 's great , no digestion problems and his skin , eyes and coat are much improved so i know it 's good for him too br br i 've had great results with harmony farms dog food that i orderd through amazon and there 's 5 pounds more for about the same price . 
my dog is really picky when it comes to his food and i usually have to mix his old with his new for a few days until he will eat his new food i opened the bag when my order arrived and gave my dog a taste he loved his new food this is his second 15 pound bag ! . 
i adopted a dog from rescue shelter who has an allergy to corn i live in a small town and found no dog food that did n't contain mainly corn this was perfect and my new pet is doing very well on it and loves it it 's an added bonus that it comes straight to my door . 
my 72 lb dog has never refused to eat newman 's own organic i'm glad that there is a pet food made without 'junk' that i can feed my pet . 
and i love buying it for her not only is it a healthy organic meal , i personally like what the newman foundation does with their profits \( after taxes \) from their products 265 million has been donated to various charities to date by their foundation i buy newman 's own products whenever i can \( their spaghetti sauce is out of this world roasted garlic yum ! \) br br my dog has eaten this food for years and years until , out of the blue , my local grocer decided not to sell it anymore i then had to grab a bag of food for her because we were out completely and decided to get beneful apparently , her digestive system did n't like it and she ended up with bloody stools that 's when i came to amazon com \( a godsend for people like me who have lame grocery stores to shop from \) and found her newman 's own dog food ! i can always depend on amazon com i 've now got this on auto delivery i trust newman 's own products and i know my dog is getting a well balanced organic meal and it 's melamine free . 
newman 's own is the best dog food ever , in my opinion my 12 year old white german shepard eats and digests this food wonderfully before changing to this food a few years ago , she had digestive problems often , even though she was fed a so called good brand name food my three year old pittie girl also eats this food , and loves it she is in perfect health i would recommend it to anyone my next door neighbor orders it now from amazon for his pittie girl amazon is a wonderful place to purchase dog and cat food , groceries , and anything you need the prices are always good , and the specials are great ! the specials are the best ever , and i was shocked to find out that a today friday special price on newman 's own dog food was automatically reflected in my subscribe and save item price of the newman 's own even though i just received a bag yesterday , i ordered two more today , and some newman 's own cat food what other retailer would automatically do that for you none that i know of amazon please continue to offer the newman 's own dog food i would be lost without the delivery , since it is difficult for me to get out and shop and carry large items like bags of dog food thank you for being here for me and snowey and sophie br linda . 
i have two small dogs who have asin b00139zpkm newman 's own br 0174 organics advanced dog chicken rice formula , 12 5 pound bag their only treats were cheerios when i switched to newman 's own brand , i was pleasantly surprised to notice they stopped their occasional vomiting with all the trouble caused by lack of standards in the industry , i immediately thought if i ca n't trust paul newman 's foods , whose can i trust and , they love it . 
my dog is allergic to most dog food i have used newman 's own dog food for several years now and i am quite happy with it i live in a small town that is 60 miles away from the nearest big city and i am unable to obtain the dog food locally it is a real convenience for me to buy this from amazon and the price is equitable . 
i was giving my dogs science diet puppy food from the time i got them at 8 weeks science diet changed the formula about 3 months ago and the food just did not smell or look right it was very oily and fishy smelling , which i realize they did at more fish oil after about three weeks of the new food , i noticed my puppies \( well now 1 year olds \) skin was very flaky like dandruff and they both had been continuous licking their paws i took them to the vet and he said they had food allergies he wanted me to take them off the science diet and put them on pumpkin and pinto beans for 7 weeks well , under duress i tried it and my dogs did not eat for 3 days i decided to try the newman 's organic and after about 4 weeks their coat looks so much better and the licking has really decreased i am so glad i saw this food when i was doing research . 
i foolishly purchased the harmony farms healthy holistic adult dog food , since it had more for the same price \( why it had good reviews is beyond me \) my dogs will not touch the harmony farms , yet love this dog food my 10 wk old pup had slimmy poop , until the day i feed her this food both my dogs love it newman 's own organics adult dog food formula is the way to go . 
we only feed our dog dry food , and it has to be good dog food newman brands are high quality , and i can get it delivered on a periodic basis and a fixed price thru amazon ginger likes it and it keeps her healthy i have learned over the years that this man , and his company , are highly moral and deliver fine quality products they stand behind . 
my three little dogs love this food and i love it too sense it is organic and has no animal by products . 
this dogfood has never been recalled , has protein as the first two ingredients , and is organic doesnt make my dog throw up like when she tries other dogfoods full of fat and fakeness cant get better ! . 
excellent i needed a dog food without copper as an ingredient and found newmansbon the internet it has proven to be a great choice and my dog had thrived . 
i feel better about feeding this product to my dogs i was using another popular brand , br but it contained a lot of fillers one of my dogs is pickier , so he would prefer a meatier br taste , but he does clean it up eventually . 
good product dogs are vary satified with it would like to have in a larger bag \( 20 lbs \) , if this could would be an option . 
my dog has been eating this food for the last three years every food i fed him before this caused smelly gas problems he almost never has gas on this food also , people often comment on how good he smells however , when he goes to grandma 's and eats junk food for a week or two he always comes home smelling like a dog it 's totally the food on top of that , he loves it love it ! . 
we were looking for an organic food after the melamine poisoning of pet food debacle newman 's own dry foods for cats and dogs are manufactured in the us per their corporate veterinarian newman 's own is up front about their ingredients for an organic food it is affordable also it has been great at keeping skin issues under control lastly newman 's own is listed as a more responsible pet food company on several websites . 
newman 's own food is one of the best on the market it is a natural healthy food for my senior dog . 
i am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it all 3 of my dogs \( 2 jack russells and 1 dachshund \) enjoy newman 's own dog food and i liked knowing it was organic the kibbles are a perfect size for easy chewing my dogs enjoyed newman 's own for about 3 months but then only nibbled on it so i decided to alternate it each month with another dog food to give my dogs some variety . 
researched the company , researched the ingredients customer service people are great sent free coupons when e mailed with a question about which of their cat foods best for my two kitties \( regular or advanced \) received good answers and not rote replies this food is made in the usa with products from the usa and has all the ingredients i think are good for my cats the two of them love , love this dry food and i have to ration it or they would chow day all day i do n't leave food out for any pet , cat or dog , to eat at will they do not like newman 's canned food however so i do n't force it on them . 
this gum is amazing the flavor burst in your mouth and it also has a wonderful refreshing sensation br we love it \( my husband and i . 
i'm really picky about the gum i chew this is great and the flavor lasts a long time i recommend it . 
this is great cheese , a little sharp yet creamy , with slight bits of crunchy great with a micro brew the merlot and raspberry are yummy too . 
my baby loves this apple sauce he did n't like the gerber brand at all , but yummys this down right away and i like that it is organic . 
our family loves these tasty and healthy sesame honey almonds by trader joe 's you get the crunchy flavor of the sesame seeds combined with the subtle sweetness of the honey and almond flavoring wow it 's a great snack that you feel good while eating it is my favorite of trader joe 's almond snacks almonds are good for you and a handful of these in the morning with a fruit smoothie or as a snack at lunch is a great way to get protein , the healthy fat and the vitamin e that almonds offer it 's a good idea to measure out 1 4 1 2 cup of these almonds or count the almonds out to stay in the calorie range you want to keep within nutritionist recommend having a small amount of almonds or walnuts each day for good fat and protein . 
i lived down in louisanna for 10 years , and community coffee is what you were served when you asked for a cup of coffee here in iowa i ca n't buy the comm coffee , so when i saw the ad to order through amazon i jumped at the offer i got 3 bags of the hazalnut and i am in coffee heaven right now , thanks amazon . 
after becoming more and more a coffee person , i 've been trying various brands and flavors in an attempt to figure out which one i prefer i 've tried other brands such as dunkin' , kirkland , and various other store brands i came across a great deal on a 3 pack of community coffee so i decided to try it the packaging is n't the best once you open it , but i have separate air tight containers which i use \( as i imagine most coffee drinkers would own \) br br i prefer dark bolder roasts , and i found that community coffee definitely fit the bill my girlfriend did n't like it , claiming it was too strong , which further reinforced my belief that it was at the right level for me i brew the coffee the traditional way \( coffee pot \) , but also via cold brewing i 've found that the cold brewed version of community coffee far surpasses the traditional , heat brewing product i'm not quite sure if this is the case for almost all coffees , but it seems even more pronounced with community coffee . 
this coffee was good but it had a distinctive aroma and taste like buttered movie theater popcorn i am a huge hazelnut flavored coffee fan and this was good , it just does n't typically taste like hazelnut you may like it but i will search for a more true hazelnut flavor do a test , make popcorn in the microwave and then later make the coffee and you will see the similarities . 
hazelnut coffee is my favorite and our local stores do n't carry it , as we live in a very small town the flavor and taste of this coffee is wonderful i start every day with it and often have an afternoon treat of a cup of the coffee i will buy again and highly recommend arived far earlier than i anticipated . 
awesome coffee ! ! ! i have ordered this pack of bags twice now and getting ready to order a third if you like dunkin donuts hazelnut , but do n't like the price this is a great and inexpensive alternative . 
we first discovered community coffee while on a visit to lake charles , la and until recently it was only available in la or by mail we prefere the hazelnut blend , it has a nice rich flavor without being overly strong this is very good coffee we like it and have a standing order with amazon to have it shipped to us at convenient intervals . 
i'm not a coffee snob , so i'm not picky about what kind of coffee i purchase i chose this because it was cheapest by the ounce and best rated i bought a href http www amazon com gp product b001eo5wo0 the coffee bean tea leaf , hand roasted hazelnut ground coffee , 12 ounce bags \( pack of 2 \) a as my first ground coffee , and i have to say , community coffee smells and tastes better than coffee bean 's ! this is totally personal preference though br br this community coffee ground tastes much darker and smoother and it smells good . 
i'm no coffee snob but this is still much better than crap you get a starbucks \( i drink black coffee so flavor really matters when its not covered by caramel and other junk \) great coffee for a great price , especially if you get it when amazon is offering the 3 off coupon . 
i do n't drink hazelnut coffee , but my wife says this is the best she has ever had and asked me to buy more for her . 
we enjoy community coffee when we go to new orleans i was glad to see it available in your online store . 
very pleased with this new coffee , thanx to another user comment and good review from someone recently when i was searching for a better priced coffee plus more importantly the price so far is still excellent all the others are ridiculous on pricing i have noticed , increasing by 4 or 5 in some cases i was getting maxwell house hazelnut , but this coffee is much tastier and maxwell house has gotten way too pricey for the quality of their hazelnut after experiencing community 's bolder flavored hazelnut you can actually taste hazelnut in community coffee it 's a bit bolder , but i like a good cup of coffee where you can actually taste the coffee \( yeah \) i do not buy or search for maxwell house any longer , nor do i enjoy folgers or any of the much more expensive brands as none of them compare to the rich flavor of community hazelnut coffee i just hope that now , finally after finding a decent tasting coffee at a good price , amazon keeps it in stock for awhile . 
it is not the best , but for the money and that extra 30 off , its the best value you can get i am very happy with my purchase and now i can drink good coffee everyday as opposed to the crap office coffee or that once a month expensive coffee after buying this , i was satisfied enough to buy another 2 pack of cafe special note the expiration dates on my hazelnut bags are 12 2011 . 
i gave this a try when it was on special and i totally love this product iam as fussy coffee drinker this product is just a lovely as those higher priced coffee 's that tend to break my bank account give it a try . 
my husband and i both like coffee with rich flavor and good taste , but we do not like the bitter or burnt taste some coffees have this community hazelnut has excellent flavor we make it fairly strong and are very pleased with this coffee . 
not the best coffee but it is not bad as well we bought more after we tried the first time because for the price we 've got it is fine godiva is still our favorite but this one is okay too . 
i 'd rank toffifay as tied with ferrero rocher for the greatest chocolate candy ever sadly toffifay is impossible to find depending on where you live i thought ordering 24 packs would be overkill but i'm going through these things like nobody 's business at this rate i 'll have to tack on an extra mile onto my daily running regimen . 
this candy has gotten harder and harder to find it was down to a couple convienence stores in my area that sold it and they stopped now a year later i typed in toffifay into bing and up pops amazon great price for a great candy and i'm well stocked up for the next 6 months the hard part is not eating it all the first week ! . 
i have been looking for this candy for over a year i used to enjoy this as a young kid and now its back ! ! all there is to say is yummy ! . 
i heard my kids talking about candy they remembered from childhood and they mentioned toffifay , so i checked amazon to see if it was still being sold it was , and reasonably priced i ordered a 24 pack , and divided it among their christmas stockings they were really surprised and happy to find it christmas morning i'm glad i thought of searching amazon ! . 
i have been experimenting with k cup brews for almost 2 years now i tried timothy 's colombia excelencia only because it was on sale and i was still looking for the one well , i finally found it columbia excelencia is the best breakfast coffee i have found to date rich , full bodied , with a clean non acrid finish it goes well with milk and splenda , no odd aftertaste whatsoever donut shop is my favorite over ice , newman 's nantucket is my favorite bold , timothy 's italian goes best with dessert , and colombia excelencia is the first thing i drink every morning . 
i have tried many different brands and flavors of k cup coffees and i have to say , this one is one of the best i have ever had i would strongly recommend it it is very hard to find so buy it if you can get it at a good price . 
this coffee is bold , dark and tasty unlike many other types that are too watery and weak this one brews nice and strong cup of coffee . 
i thought this coffee was really good , but i think the next time i order , i will order something a bit stronger . 
this is by far the best decaf i 've ever tried you ca n't brew it on the large cup setting you have to brew it on the 8 oz setting , do n't try to stretch it to the 10 oz or it will be too weak however , when brewed at 8 oz this is smooth , tasty and tastes like coffee not bitter and you ca n't tell it 's a decaf . 
i am from colombia and i was looking for a coffee that tasted like back home everyday when i make coffee and the aroma is in the whole kitchen it feels like home and it tastes just like it i love this coffee . 
we love this medium full flavored roast very smooth taste no bitter or acidic taste , at all excellent coffee good value \) also , try timothy 's kona very good , also . 
my husband has been taking this sinus buster tea once a day \( before bedtime \) for about 6 months already , he usually had a real bad sinus problem before but now it is almost completely gone this tea is so wonderful and it really helps when he skipped for a few days because ran out of it then the sinus came back again do n't want to skip it for so long anymore highly recommended . 
i'm very happy with this drains my ears and sinuses quite effectively works better for me than guaifenisen . 
the sinus buster tea had an interesting aroma when seeping it 's taste is acquired not offense at least to say more like burnt bark or really overheated coffee i had no drainage of my sinuses while drinking one cup of the tea the next morning i could feel relief of pressure and pain i would prefer this product over any inhaled sinus relief agent as a plus all the ingredients of the tea are on the package in english nothing unknown . 
i found this tea by accident but it worked so well that i later ordered it , br br after not being able to find it again it really helps open nasal passages br br since starting to use it whenever i have bad nasal congestion , i have not br br had a sinus infection everyone is different , but it sure worked for me . 
i used it for a sinus infection where i lost my voice completely and had a sore throat i found this product on yelp and went to an herbal asian store in chinatown in phila i only paid 2 50 ! the only difference is that i did n't get tea bags they were dissoluble cubes you place in the hot water it worked great it took a few hours to work but it worked ! the next day i had my voice back completely and no sore throat one night i woke up from terrible post nasal drip cough , took a cup of this tea and it eliminated the cough and put me right to sleep a must buy , its cheap and natural you cant go wrong if you give it a try . 
its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed i do n't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants this is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work ! i have not tried it during a sinus migraine yet but for moderate congestion it works wonders smells a bit off but the taste is just fine make sure to seep it for 10 15 mins or it wo n't work give it about 10 20 mins to kick in seems to last for 3 4 hrs no side affects that i can tell so glad to be rid of the racing heart side affect and dry mouth sore throat that comes with sudafed it works great paired with a sinus rinse or netty pot . 
i love this tea , seriously ! my mom and i suffer very bad with sinus problems and we heard about this tea called sinus busters we just had to see what all the talk was about , you know it is a very good tea that takes your blues away and make you sleep great aloha ! . 
i have been suffering from post nasal drip and congestion for so many years , and this tea made such a big difference after a couple of days i drink it 1 2 times per day and i feel so much better i can breathe easier , and have little or no post nasal drip throughout the day . 
not sure exactly what is in it , but it really helps my sinus condition a family member who spent time in china said it tasted like other healing herbs she had had while there the taste is earthy , and takes some getting used to , but it is worth it . 
i am having to change my original post on this tea my husband and i both suffer from sinus problems i made up a big tea pot \( with 2 tea bags \) and let it steep for 15 minutes i had 2 cups and my husband had one neither of us noticed any difference with our sinuses a few days later i decided to try the tea again i brewed one cup of tea with one tea bag i let it sit again for several minutes i guess the first time i tried it i did not make it strong enough this time i noticed a difference as my sinuses are a little clearer . 
i used to take sudafed for my stuffy nose i tried this tea and felt relief immediately i usually drink this tea twice a week and have not yet felt the stuffy nose would highly recommend . 
i bought this tea based upon some research i had done into the ingredients and by reading the reviews posted here this tea has a wonderful flavor and smell i have enjoyed it very much and it helps me at bedtime with my sinus issues great stuff ! . 
i am so please that i was able to get the tea from amazon i was pleased with the service sinus buster herbal tea is very helpful and it gives me great relief with my allergy br br i have been suffered with hay fever allergy for the past 20 years or more first time i find a medication which is natural and no side affects compare to other medication for allergy br br i discovered the tea at a farm market in pa on a bus ride with my church at first i was hesitated to purchase the tea , but somoeone who was in the same but i was , told me to buy the tea because she used it a year ago , and got great relief from it with her allergy br br thanks , br br mc . 
but a naturapath told me to take this , vitamin d , vitamin c , and something he mixed and i got better from a 8 month sinus issue . 
we love sinus buster tea my husband thinks it 's great and clears out his sinus' regularly . 
i absolutely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from sinus headaches my brother had given me a couple of bags to try a few months ago in the past i have had serious sinus headaches after drinking this tea , my headaches were gone and the clicking in my nostril had ceased ! i was so relieved ! i have recently drank this tea for a dry cough ! big mistake , it gave me a sore throat as well as other issues i will never drink it for the common cold symptoms ! love this product though ! . 
buffalo bills premium snacks br br i realize that taste is an individual thing , but i thought i 'd share my thoughts on these products br br first , customer service is excellent i 've always gotten exactly what i ordered in a very timely manner br br so far i 've ordered the following products br br 1 \) buffalo bills 2 1lbs mild short shots br br 2 \) buffalo bills 2 1lbs hot short shots br br the first two short shots are very similar to slim jim 's , just not individually wrapped , i just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on \( about a quarter pound per bag br br 3 \) buffalo bills 1 2lb extra smokeys br these are very smokey , but a little too dry for my taste br br 4 \) buffalo bills 16oz premium hickory beef jerky pieces \( random size \) br br taste great if you are a jerky lover br br 5 \) buffalo bills 2 1lb pepperoni short shots br probably the closest to slim jim 's of all the short shots br br 6 \) big buffalo ole smokies br fatter , crisp not as crunchy as short shots , individually wrapped br br 7 \) buffalo bills 2 1lbs honey strung br o k taste my wife hates the smell my brother does n't care much for them either br br all in all , i highly recommend these products \( in the order listed \) and this company br br gunner january , 2010 . 
good , light taste not too strong of a flavoring , and very little , if any , aftertaste they go down easy , mmmmm definitely happy with the purchase . 
i learned about these from a co worker after he made a bulk purhcase of several kinds of beef sticks a year ago he spread them around and so i got to sample a variety i 've ordered the honey stung four times since then two other co workers have also ordered them on several occassions this past year and they 're believers too additionally , we 've all ordered several of the buffalo bills brands and they 're all superb ! as long as you do n't eat the whole bag , i 'd also call these atkins friendly as well , as that is also a motivator for me ordering these so many times \( other than them being just being great , well seasoned snacks \) buy 'em , you 'll love 'em ! . 
i enjoyed this product they are a good value for the amount you get i did not sense much honey in the product , so a bit more flavor would be nice i would buy again . 
i though it was fresh , moist however , personally alittle to sweet for me i think i`ll stick with the john wayne brand jw brand is more expensive but it seems to soot my taste buds better . 
i was a little skeptical on ordering the teriyaki sticks version based on a couple of reviews but , i am happy i did they were a soft stick as someone said but had a nice crunch when you bit in the teriyaki was milder than others i have ordered and they were more smokey but they are called ole' smokeys i did not get the greasy mouth feel that someone said and it did have a pleasant tasting after taste all in all , worth a 4 rating but it could be a 5 based on individual tastes . 
these snacks are very different than , say , slim jims they are moist and seems less processed than many of the convenience store meat snacks out there there was a nice hint of spice laced with honey i would say they tasted and had a texture that i might have expected in a more expensive product i will buy them again and will recommend them to friends and family . 
i bought the buffalo bills teriyaki ole' smokies beef sticks because i absolutely love beef sticks , especially teriyaki , and i thought this would be a good buy good quantity for the price br br the teriyaki beef sticks themselves were very tasty and flavorful i also loved the texture , it was very soft and tender br br the only bad thing i 'd have to say about this product is that it leaves me with a very greasy , fatty residue all over the rood of my mouth , which kind of takes away from the flavor and my ability to fully enjoy the product aside from that , i may still order it again \) . 
i purchased the honey stung smokies and some of the reviews stated that they were mushy , i would n't go that far , but they are softer then most beef sticks but they still have a 'snap' to them the taste is great , even the picky kids liked these smokies i think we will try some of the other flavors plus order these again . 
really great snack for hiking or a baseball game my son and i enjoy taking them when we go on a road trip to hold us over till we find a good restaurant ! . 
taste great , once in awhile you will come across a pocket of fat but its worth the risk anything from this supplier is good quality and value . 
these have a good snap when you bite into them and a nice honey beef taste ! br choo choo r snacks always has excellent customer service , and they throw in a few samples as well ! . 
i really enjoyed these beef sticks even though i preferred them to be a little bit harder , they were tasty i just put them in the frig and that worked out fine nice flavor , not too sweet or spicy they sure did n't last in my house ! . 
i like this product very much the honey flavor makes them taste very good and they are bigger and thicker than most others i 've seen the saddlebag package is ingenious why open and expose to the air all 100 when you only have to open half at a time leave one half \( 50 \) completely sealed one package of 100 thick beef sticks can sustain someone for a very long time use for emergency shelters , mountain climbing , backpacking , camping , hiking , survival training , or any survival situation theres plenty \( 100 \) , so you could sustain yourself a long time if lost just these very light storable beefsticks and a jar of peanut butter unopened and a large jug of water in a vehicle could sustain life for a very long time at a minimum of space and weight they appear kind of home made , unlike any beef sticks i have seen in stores before my dogs like them also i break off 1 2 pieces whenever they need a treat i see nothing in the ingredients that suggest dogs ca n't eat them however i want each person to evaluate this on their own not just because i say so my 5 dogs have had pieces of them now and then and love them and havent shown any signs of being sick or having less energy i recommend them . 
i love this product and order it quite often for my big boys to take hunting just wish the seller would take the time and money to change the label to say mild instead of spicy it isnt spicy and they have at least put a sticker on the package but have not changed the discription on line so i thought i was actually purchasing spicy this time still a wonderful product . 
could only find at local shell gas station now i have a source to buy all i want ! fast secure delivery price is great ! will order again , and again , etc , . 
these beef sticks have a great flavor and the price seems fair there is no label stating as to where this product needs to be refrigerated . 
beef sticks and honey what a great combination ! the ole smokies beef sticks are full of flavor adding honey gives them a little twist of sweetness that just puts them over the top the honey stung ole' smokies are always a favorite with our friends the saddlebag pack is a perfect take along to football parties . 
this wine actually turned out really well i made some modifications to the kit however if you figure out the potential alcohol content , this kit would probably get around 7 , but by adding additional sugar at the primary fermentation , i ended up with 13 i also did n't use the whole f pack it would have been way to sweet instead , i topped the carboy off with an unoaked chardonnay that i like . 
i have now made a few of the amazon wine kits the cornucopia are all fruity flavored sweet wines within a month of bottling the pear chablis our 30 bottles is down to 6 remaining we have given as gifts and taken to get togethers my only negative comment is that the starting specific gravity is low therefore these are lower alcohol wines i did add a couple cups of sugar to the fermenter at the beginning but worried that adding too much sugar would throw off the flavor of the wine anyway , the pear chablis is a nice easy drinking wine it has an attractive label i used clear bottles and the final product looks sharp br if you are looking for straight wines that are not sweet fruit flavored wines , check out the vino italiano kits these also come with corks , foils , and labels they are a higher alcohol wine than the cornucopia kits with a starting sg closer to 1 090 . 
just bottled this wine about 2 weeks ago opened the bottle yesterday , and wow ! ! i ca n't believe how good it is lots of pear flavor , and having experience with this brand , i know that when i let it sit for a couple months , it will be much better the sweetness mellows out a little , but still is great ! i have made about 6 of the cornucopia wines , all with good results if you like the sweeter wines , you have to try this ! . 
i bought this kit and i have to say that it was a hit it was originally bought for my wife but then she decided to trade off 15 of these for 15 of the white zin that we were making for a friends wedding at the wedding it went quick and many people were asking me to make it for them my answer was here is where you buy the kit and if you want to buy it and the bottles i would be happy to make it for you i do not have a license to sell it since this is just a hobby for me br i did add one can of white grape concentrate after the f pack was added and that added so much more flavor br i promise that you ca n't go wrong with this kit if you like a sweet chardonnay . 
this turned out fantastic , a little sweeter than i expecting but still great may even consider this a dessert wine its nice using cornucopia kits as they come complete with all the supplies you need , corks , labels , toppers , etc i only use distilled water in the making of the wine , dont want to chance it with anything else they have always turned out great give it a try the farmwiner . 
this is definitely sweet , but that 's how i like my wine no backsweetening needed ! it has a pear flavor and chilled well , it 's my favorite . 
good kit , however using the f pack \( pear juice \) made it way too sweet , i ordered two more and intent to blend the kits , the second two with out the added pear juice . 
i would call this a summer wine light with strong pear notes almost clear in color nice finish and a good wine for those who do n't really like wine . 
i bought this kit after i really enjoyed making the tropical riesling from the same manufacturer it was equally easy to make , but it is very peary i would n't have minded it if it was more subtle still very drinkable , but i suspect that i 'll be mixing it more . 
this is my 6th kit i have made and as usual it is simply amazing ! ! ! i am truly hooked on all amazon 's wine kits as they have all turned out better then i have ever imagined for the price i could n't be happier with the results and will continue to purchase these kits to add to my wine cellar i am in the process of fermenting the barolo and am eagerly anticipating the end results . 
this is my third wine kit and it 's going so fast i should order another we took samples from all three kits to a thanksgiving get together more than once , i heard , who 's going to finish off this bottle so we can open another pear \? . 
6 hour power 's ingredients are pretty much the same as its rival , 5 hour energy 's , so obviously the effect is pretty much the same yet , this cost me 18 for 12 while the other cost me 8 for 2 at the nearest store br br great savings even if you only need these just a couple times a week br br the taste is n't as tangy and addictive as 5 hour energy 's berry flavor a bit bland in comparison , but it 's still nowhere close to bad . 
this stuff will give you a marked energy boost note that every person is different for me , this lasted 3 hours before the crash \( not a sugar crash \) but my heart was pounding like it wanted to burst through my chest br br so i only drink half at a time \( like another reviewer \) and it works , without the scary heart acceleration br br it 's even tasty . 
the 6 hour power energy shot does just what it says a lot of times i only drink half the bottle to achieve the mental alertness that i look for it 's one of the best energy shots out there when you figure in price , taste and effectiveness . 
pros free super saving shipping , small , juicy taste , diffrent flavors , and healthy br br cons sometimes seller only haves 12 vs 36 to order i like to have several packs . 
being from greece i can say with certainty that this is an original cretan olive oil its pure and full taste makes it ideal for cooking , salads and dressings we were thrilled to find here in usa an original product deriving from our country and my wife likes to use it every time she cooks , resulting in tasty and full flavored foods i would strongly recommend this basic component of the mediterranean diet to anyone who want to improve his nutritional habits . 
i use this olive oil for salads , dipping bread in it , hummus , and sauteing veggies and meat its a very high quality oil with a delicious taste ! try the oil by itself and compare to another olive oil and you 'll see the difference ! i 've gotten my girlfriend and my mom both hooked on it in addition , it has been great getting to know nick who helps manage the production \( as compared to what you buy in the store from a big brand \) since he goes to the farmers markets here in cincinnati and lets people sample the oil br br i 've only recently found how much better local veggies and other products at the farmers market can really taste , all for just a couple extra dollars a bottle of olive oil lasts a long time so paying a couple extra dollars compared to buying another cheaper brand , is more than worth it ! . 
i'm a little biased in my review , but i firmly believe that mt kofinas extra virgin olive oil is the best olive oil you can buy it has the best blend of flavor and low acidity that i 've tastes anywhere i 've tastes olive oils that say they have 1 acidity levels , but then they do n't taste like anything at all i 've also tastes olive oils that claim all sorts of awards that have made me have a coughing fit from their pepperiness here 's what i think it 's all about the flavor , and mt kofinas simply tastes the best also , since it 's sources from one area , i'm not worried about any other oils being in my delicious extra virgin olive oil br br if you want to taste some truly delicious olive oil that does n't cost a lot , try mt kofinas olive oil . 
i picked up my first bottle at our local farmers' market we loved it so much so flavorful but sadly , there is no farmers' market in the winter so glad to see it on amazon . 
this olive oil is great tastes very good and is outstanding for use with bread , pasta , and for cooking in general love the flavor . 
i have a pit bull who is a little over a year old to say he is food motivated is an understatement however , with that being said he is still picky he adores these treats and others from darford i do much research before i feed treats food to my dog and i could not find any bad information on this company i promote these treats to family friends that have dogs and their dogs are also hooked good wholesome treats . 
out of all the brands of bully sticks , true chews has to be one of me and my dog 's favorites my favorite because they are not messy , they dont break apart as easy as some of the cheaper brands , and they do not smell ! my pup loves it because it does n't make him sick , does n't give him gas , and gives him hours days of fun their whole lineup is great and highly recommended if you have a puppy dog with a sensitive tummy fyi my pup is currently 5 months old and is a 8lb shihpoo i gave it one less mark only because they are one of the more expensive brands and that they are a tad hard to find locally . 
other pretzel shaped beef tendon were too big for toy breed , but not this little one i'm happy to find a usa product that is nutritional and easy to chew and digest lasts a long time give it to her for an hour a day for 4 5 days she likes the pretzel better than the little barbell not smelly or greasy also likes a href http www amazon com gp product b000nv83eg merrick flossies dog treats , 50 treats a , which last a long time too i try to switch up the shape of the chew b c i think it helps her teeth . 
i was a little worried about the other reviews that said their wrappers were broken i wonder if they were pushing the wrappers they suggested \( both suggested the same wrappers hmmm \) however , the wrappers arrived intact in fact we took two packages camping and the left overs made it home without damage i detected no difference from the rice wrappers we buy locally at an asian market buying in bulk saved lots of there were a couple of wrappers out of dozens that had a few tiny air bubble holes in them it did n't affect the taste or function that is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 we were n't wrapping anything that was really drippy so it was n't a problem we will definitely order again shipping was rapid a great buying experience . 
these are beautiful , smooth spring roll wrappers and on the package label there is a sticker on each one that reads , new technology , so , i'm figuring by the bad reviews that this company changed the way they manufacture their spring roll wrappers and have probably upped their quality control as well i was nervous about ordering these by the bad reviews but i'm glad i took a chance because these are a bargain compared to some of the other brands br br will definitely order these again ! . 
i'm not the best cook , but i like to try new things to make my diet healthier i confess that i love ramen noodles , and this product helps me cut the salt content the flavor packet that comes in ramen noodles usually has between 600 900 grams of sodium per serving \( 2 servings in the packet i eat the whole thing , so that 's a lot of salt this miso contains 880 grams sodium per tablespoon i add a table spoon to my ramen , then just a light sprinkle of original flavor packet , cutting the salt almost in half , while still adding a nice savory flavor i also add a handful of frozen peas , but i like to keep it simple i'm sure there are many other recipes and uses to be found out there , so enjoy ! . 
we are regular customers for the delicious coffee and purchase the decafe french roast also it makes a single fresh cup at a time in our flavia coffee maker . 
in my area one cannot find cinnamon mentos i am so happy i was able to find this flavor i just love this product . 
this product is my wife 's favorite kids love it too would suggest it if you like cinnamon i would buy this again . 
this is really good green tea without bitterness or the orange discoloration which is a sign of old green tea stay away from the big brands like lipton , twinnings , and bigelow they do well with black tea but not green br br for green tea go with this , uncle lee 's , or tazo you 'll never be able to go back to the others , which will taste like swill from a polluted river br br this is real green tea and it 's not expensive recommended br br sincerely , br br rusk reeder . 
dynasty brand green tea is the best green tea i 've ever tasted it never tastes stale , unlike brands i 've bought in grocery stores this is because each tea bag is packed in a sealed envelope with a metallic lining the metal apparently keeps out moisture . 
they are awesome to snack on they have a little kick to them but that 's the best part they help me with my cravings for sweets . 
reed 's crystallized ginger is the real deal ! it 's natural and basically just ginger with sugar 1 piece takes care of my candy cravings and aids my digestion of lunch etc . 
try these first for all your seafood soups and stews they 're just amazing the flavor enhances all your seafood and just makes it wonderful plus , these are great just to snack on out of the bag kids love them ! we use them for chilis , soups , and recipes as well highly recommend ! . 
if you are on the paleo caveman primal hunter gatherer diet , you will adore these cookies ! br otherwise stay away , your taste buds are n't attuned to the uniquely sweet natural cookies end of story paleo purchase , sad \( standard american diet \) skip it . 
these taste very good , but are n't like the best things ever either in order of my preference \( gross to good \) with explanation the rainforest flavor one is my least favorites \( i do n't recommend this particular flavor \) has a weird cayenne pepper aftertaste to it \( do n't get me wrong , i love cayenne , but not in a cookie ! \) the tropical one tastes as if corn bread was turned into a cookie version \( not a bad taste really good , actually ! \) the original is very great i forgot the taste though , but i remember liking it alpine , in my opinion , is the best it tastes like a european type of christmas cookie it has a chocolaty \( carob \) taste to it , but not overly sweet . 
i love these cookies i am on the paleo diet right now and these cookies are what i look forward too i do like the taste of the tropical one the best they all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place i expected the taste to be different and it is other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy of course not br br when i eat them , i do n't even feel bad about it because my body welcomes them they do n't make me crash either and feel like i ate junk food it is a good indicator that these were made from all natural ingredients i wish i had these cookies close to me i 'd buy them every single day ! . 
i thought i 'd try the multi pack to see which flavor i liked the best , but i like them all they are healthy , fulfilling , and all good ingredients i can actually pronounce these are the smaller packs , and now i can proceed to ordering the larger bags love these cookies ! . 
i just started the paleo diet and i love it ! lost 4 lbs in like a week ! anyway i was so glad to find out there are paleo cookies out there and thank goddess they 're good ! ! i loved the original and when they sent me them i got a sample of tropical and i loved that too ! so i ordered the tropical and got a sample of rainforest ! at first they 're good but if you read the ingredients u 'll see there is cayenne pepper in it and im really sensitive to hot spices and i could sooo feel it on my tong ! it was like an after taste but if u enjoy a little fire with ur sweet u 'll like rainforest flavor ! really wanna try the alpine flavored ones they 're a lot darker in color so it should be interesting \) good job caveman bakery ! i love you ! . 
i bought a 40 sampler pack from the caveman bakery website it 's not exactly like a cookie consistency however the texture and chewiness of the cookie i like they kind of remind me of like those natural nut and fruit bars , like kind or something of the ones i 've tried , alpine and tropical are my favorites mainly because alpine has hazelnut and tropical has a coconut taste in it the least favorite that i 've tried is either the rainforest , it has a strong taste of ginger and i'm not a fan of ginger the other ones are pretty good too however , i did n't realize that these cookies were so small , but i guess based on the big portions of today 's society , this is a normal portion br br overall its good , would i buy again \? maybe if i was on a strict gluten free diet . 
with all of the choices of things to drink , this is an excellent one it tastes great most of our choices are either loaded with sugar , or carbonated even milk is sugar dense this drink is good for blood pressure and cholesterol it is an excellent thirst quencher so much better for the hot summer months than sugary lemonade ! it does , however acidify the ph i am supposed to be alkalizing my diet , so i ca n't drink a lot of this \( br br from the time i was a small child , my mother was an advocate of apple cider vinegar and honey for health hippocrates would have been happy to discover bragg organic apple cider vinegar all natural drink concord grape acai \) \) \) try it and drink to good health ! . 
this may not be the best tasting thing i have ever drank but man do i feel instant results after drinking some i would best describe the effects as very close to the good feeling you experience when you drink coffee i notice that my circulation feels fantastic like my whole body is warm , a very healthy dose of energy and i dont notice any jitteryness like coffee or energy drinks give you the only reason i didnt rate it 5 start is because a 16oz bottle is 3 00 which i think is a little steep but for the great feeling i get when i drink some i would highly recommend it to anyone else who wants to feel a boost of energy as well as a general sense of well being . 
let me preface this by saying i purchased it at a local health food store for about a dollar less i was pleasantly surprised with this drink it tastes great , but definitely a little tangy what i loved about this was how great i felt after drinking it i felt awake and focused , and just overall really good i will definitely be buying more . 
i bought this drink locally and i have to tell you , they got it 'just right' if you are like me and you like the flavor of vinegar , this drink will not disappoint , if you also like the flavor of grape the mixture was done perfectly , no stinging taste , it 's sort of mellow , yet has that flavor of vinegar you are looking for i am highly impressed with it i went back today and bought 5 more bottle of it at the local co op braggs is a highly regarded apple cider vinegar , so , to have that kind of base to start with means alot i can pretty much promise you , that you will 'not' be disappointed if you buy it they have a couple other flavors , which i will eventually try , but this one has me hooked hehe \) . 
this is the best ever just add hot water and mix yummy with anything can even add to cream sauces and soups add some sausage and you are in heaven yummy yum cannot go wrong ordering this product . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b000koum68 pioneer brand gravy mix , country , 2 75 ounce packets \( pack of 24 \) a br br i had this gravy at the breakfast buffet in the motel in branson , mo br very good ! ! ! the waitress told me the name , so i looked it up on the internet and found it at amazon i give it the excellent rating . 
we use these for our daughter for a few reasons one , they are healthier than other cereal bars on the market \( whole grain \) two , they have yogurt incorporated into the bar three , the are thick and do not easily crumble since our daughter starting eating them when she was about 1 , not having to clean up after she 's eaten them is a big plus br br plus , they are super yummy for adults too br br they are more expensive than others on the market \( esp since i can get nutrigrain bars in bulk at a discount \) but they are worth it makes our life easier and they do n't have a ton of added sugars ! . 
these are really excellent breakfast bars note to the previous reviewer the nutrigrain bars , last i checked , had artificial color in them these do n't they also taste very good this is our third order through amazon \( great price \) and my daughter misses them when we 're out . 
the flavor of the fruit enclosed is outstanding \( bluberry \) and if there is a drawback it is that the blanket that encloses the fruit is a bit thick \( unlike this companys fig bars \) and pastry textured flavored with cane syrup \( not fruit juice \) 150 cal per bar , and low in fat and the carbs \( 29 \) not too bad considering the great taste . 
i keep a box of these in my desk at work they make a wonderful snack or are great if i did n't have time for breakfast . 
my boys have been eating these for over 3 years now recently the box has been redesigned i like it and it 's much easier to open now it used to have sharp edges and made it easy to get paper cuts it seems the recipe has changed for the bar it 's softer than what it used to be the boys still like it they eat only this all day long if i let them . 
whole family likes these tasty but not over sweet much more healthy for you than most bars excellentprice through amazon on the repeating order subscription . 
my son has been eating these for the last two years and loves them i love them because they have yogurt in them , and for a picky eater provides some good nutrition wish they were organic , but we ca n't have them all much healthier than nutragrain . 
good product ! good price fast shipping needs an insert in lid to seal container better ! . 
i could n't find this product in the store i love the size and the price was just right love the promptness of the delivery . 
as an avid rice cracker fan , i 've tried a lot of different varieties , and this is the best as far as taste and availability goes obviously some of the best are in the japanese grocery stores , but at least in my case , they 're out of the way most of the time br br the crackers themselves are savory and crunchy exactly what i look for in this snack \( and this particular mix is nothing but crackers ! \) br thanks to these , i 've stopped trying out the regular grocery store imitations . 
our corgi loves all sizes , shapes , and flavors of dingo bone treats ! the other reviewer commented on the vendor we 've never got a bad dingo yet ! highly recommended ! . 
i recommand this product my childrens \( 5 and 3 \) love it , pouches as very usefull especially for breaks br to choose enjoy . 
i 've tried many different brands of virginia peanuts but these are far and away the best i 've turned my entire family on to this brand and they 've ordered them also they 're superb . 
first of all , there are two kinds of paprika sweet and hot both are delicious but the szeged sweet paprika is more versatile than the hot kind \( which is also awesome ! \) i have been using this spice for years and the hungarian type is consistently better than any other type brand use this on meat , veggies , cassaroles , salad , baked bries , quiches , egg dishes , shrimp , pretty much anything i use this in soup all winter long , especially with gulyas levas \( this is a traditional hungarian soup though it is often confused with goulash \) and czipetke br br this product is the large restaurant size , which is the only size to have if you do any amount of cooking because once you try this you will love it 's versatility ! ! ! ! . 
i was so pleased with this purchase a great value since i got them on a monthly sale ! ! i love to have these on hand for they come into play so nicely in so many recipes always a joy to have a good crunch in some recipes one of my favorite ways to use this larger can is to wrap a piece of bacon around them and secure with a toothpick then i dip them in a apricot ginger marinade and put in the oven until the bacon is crisp my family loves an appetizer dinner once in a while and this is one of their favorites be mindful that this is a larger can so have a couple of recipes in mind for them when opening , although they do stay fresh in the frig for a while . 
not only is the sweetener great in coffee or ice tea it makes a slammin skinny margarita also try their agava simple syrup love it . 
i adore using this very vanilla bean paste especially for my cream pies and ice cream why , it 's like adding a touch of heaven , but without any of the bother of scraping out vanilla bean pods the flavor is also better to my liking too than vanilla beans the price is way , way better too and it 's stores fabulously on the shelf for ages ! br br for combined shipping , be sure to get their sweet dough flavoring and powdered vanilla too you 'll be glad you did ! br br for more cooking tips techniques google my name sharonanne . 
enfamil premium lipil formula is the same as the previous flagship mead johnson formula enfamil lipil except that it has prebiotics added in our son was on enfamil lipil from september 2007 september 2008 he was breastfed and formula fed during this time our daughter , who is due in january 2010 , will also be breastfed and formula fed for her first year of life we tried two other formulas with our son similac advance and parent 's choice the similac was fine but clumped badly during the time we experimented with the parent 's choice formula , my son was consistently troubled by colds and the flu i think the parent 's choice formula lowered his immunity somehow and will never use it again i believe that mead johnson 's decision to use prebiotics is a good one our son had colic acid reflux in part because his digestive system was not yet populated with the good bacteria for breaking down milk proteins he was a lot more comfortable after we started putting a little culturelle \( a probiotic \) in his formula in the evening and since a lot of our immune system is in our digestive tract , he had fewer sick days after introducing the culturelle probiotics and prebiotics will also help infants rebound from the negative effects of antibiotics like amoxicillin quicker br br regarding the bpa found in formula can liners , i talked to an enfamil customer service representative who told me that mead johnson now uses cans that are lined with a modified polyester that is bpa free similac advance earlyshield comes in a bpa free can also \( the simplepac container \) br br another concern parents have is the cost of formula name brand formulas are expensive ! but if you think about it , you are feeding a human being for about 15 a week \( a can usually lasts us 1 5 to 2 weeks \) 15 a week is peanuts compared to what a hungry teenager devours ! and with name brand formulas you are getting the absolute best product available bill gates could n't buy a better formula than what 's on the shelves at target or wal mart br br if you are a new parent and feel overwhelmed by the infant formula section of your grocery store \( as i was in september 2007 \) , i suggest starting with the flagship formula of either mead johnson \( enfamil premium lipil \) , abbott laboratories \( similac advance earlyshield \) , or nestle \( good start gentle plus or good start protect plus \) they are all excellent infant formulas you just have to see what works for you and your baby . 
i wish i found the plastic refill packs instead of 6 giant metal cans seems like a lot of wasted packaging i just did n't know to look for them until much later but , its much cheaper from amazon than the gocery store probably about the same price as costco but no tax here and super convenient and , the formula mixes well , my kid loves it and \( most importantly \) his poops seem normal not nasty formula poops if you know what i mean ! . 
alot of moms like me like this item because our babies have no constapation on it i love it very much . 
no gas for baby , no extra bubbles when you shake it in warm or cold water , mixes perfectly without much time this is easy my kid was happy swapping from breast milk to this with no hesitation when my milk dried up at 6mths . 
we had to move to formula when our baby was 8 weeks we have found enfamil premium to mix easier than the regular enfamil lipil our baby has had no digestive issues from the formula i love getting it in bulk from amazon as it saves the weekly trip to the store for formula the price \( with free shipping \) is comparable with local grocery stores in the austin area . 
our baby loves it and amazon is very reliable and fast free super saver shipping is always a good deal thanks amazon . 
i read other reviews before buying and they are not encoraging but still for some reasons , i got to buy \( to use my amazon gift card \) but then i am very happy with the purchase delivery is prompt quantity is correct over all a few bucks savings than you buy at a retail shop . 
have tried a few different peanut brittle 's from amazon and this is by far the best it is loaded with peanuts plus being in a sealed tin makes it seem fresher wit minimal breakage . 
i have been buying new morning graham crackers since february of 2010 never had a problem with damage of the crackers in shipping br why did amazon remove the graham crackers from subscribe and save \? \? \? \? \? why did amazon remove the graham crackers from prime \? \? \? the crackers are a much higher price from a third party seller i will purchase the crackers from whole foods not fair of amazon to take away the connivence of ordering a case . 
my husband has to limit the amount of sugar he takes in and these contain no sugar , and they taste great ! . 
i rarely want to eat much when i first arise in the morning but i do have coffee i 've found that these cinnamon graham crackers work great for me as a little something to eat along with my coffee they are graham crackers not anything super duper amazing but they are nice , cinnamony graham crackers that are organic . 
my children will only eat healthy products , and they love these graham crackers i am so glad that they are available through amazon ! . 
these are very good , they were a great price and fast free shipping when you purchase enough food the only thing is that the box was smaller than i guessed it would be . 
i was quite surprised to find that sociables were available thru amazon i cannot find them in the local supermarkets and thought i would have to give them up br they arrived quickly , in great condition , and we now are on regular shipments of them . 
wow i heard of this candy but could never find it , now i am hooked now i do n't have to suck on child lemons with salt , just shakey shakey . 
i absolutely love these ! seven of these sweet , very thin graham crisps are only 60 calories , but it 's easy to eat a lot of them and there are almost 80 in the package delicious by themselves wonderful with ice cream if they are purchased using amazon 's add on program there is no shipping charge br br update i 've seen mixed reviews of this company 's products the items i 've purchased have not been stale or strange smelling . 
i love the 34 degree cracked peppercorn , wheat , and other varieties so i thought i would try the caramel , cinnamon , and graham as an alternative to cookies or regular graham crackers true you can have a lot of these crackers for little calories carbs , but the flavor is bland in terms of satisfaction , they do n't quite cut it for me as a snack unless i put peanut butter or something on them they would probably be good as part of a fruit and cheese dessert platter , along with some peanut butter , fruit spread , honey , or cream cheese . 
this soup is good i really love this brand of soups my favorite being the chicken and dumplings healthy choice is n't always the best brand when it comes to frozen meals but for some reason they really knocked it out of the park with their soups i love them , they taste homemade and amazingly better than campbell 's or progresso i recommend this , the chicken and dumplings , the split pea and ham in fact , every variety i 've tried has been delicious you ca n't really go wrong with this . 
first , i agree with j bishop 's \( houston , tx \) review br br this is not only the best flavor of the healthy choice soup line , it is clearly among the best canned soup flavors of all time br br healthy choice is the only brand of canned soup i buy on any regular basis it 's the only brand that has never used msg a sure sign that a recipe lacks imagination \( not too mention sodium issues \) br br i really wish i could buy quantities of this in the microwave packaging \( hard to find in stores \) a lifetime supply would do nicely . 
first off , there is a difference when you drink something out of box versus glass a big difference br br i was strolling in my local health food store and saw that this product was being packaged in a bottle i snatched that sucker off the shelf faster than you could blink br br i had tried this brand visiting a bigger city over a year ago only to find out when i got home that they did n't sell the canned version at my store i was so bummed but not up for ordering cases of this stuff online br br i have tried the other brands this is by far the best it could be because it 's in a glass i'm not a high end taste tester but i just know there is a big difference and this stuff is like wine best served when chilled so being in a glass bottle makes all the difference in the world guess you could make that analogy of boxed wined versus bottled i 'll always take bottle over boxed even if the box is more bang for your buck i'm a foodie i love savoring food and beverage br br a lot of people are mentioning it 's over priced compared to what \? and if you notice it 's not amazon selling it , it 's a distributor using amazon as a portal to advertise and sell it the free shipping is really put into the cost of the price of a case they could reduce the price but then it would probably say 10 15 00 for shipping it really would not make a difference br br but i'm happy it 's at my local health food store i'm not ready to buy this by the case woohoo thanks , taste nirvana this really is happiness in a bottle go get your own i'm not sharing \) . 
this brand is a little hard to find in stores as i do n't think it 's carried by any of the major supermarket chains i discovered it at au bon pain and noticed that unlike other brands i 've tried , this one is not from concentrate and has nothing added , it 's just pure unadultered coconut water , so the quality ca n't get much better the other thing i really like about it is that it 's a glass container rather than paper or plastic , so the taste is not compromised these things alone are worth 5 stars to me but there are a couple things i would suggest to make it even better first , this is n't really pulp the way you would think of it from you experience with fruit juices where there 's pulverized , very small , drinkable pieces floating in the liquid these are chunks of diced coconut that you have to chew up while drinking to me , this would be fine if they were all the soft flesh you 'd expect from a young cocunut but many of the pieces are harder which is unpleasant in a drink second , 9 5 ounces does n't go a long way , i 'd like to see it bumped up to at least a 12oz , i 'd then feel like i'm getting an adequate amount for my money and it would last longer and quench better . 
if you like coconut water , then you will love taste nirvana ! ! ! it has bits of coconut in it not just a few , it has a lot of little bits . 
this is great coconut water and there is no added sugar its all natural and they use ripe coconut not young coconut . 
pretty close to the taste of a freshly opened coconut i 'd like to know more about the process for obtaining this water to understand what the natural coconut water means the tasty juicy bits of pulp in the product add an extra complexity and make this a very refreshing beverage the fresh coconut is jelly like and not so pulpy , but it 's still tasty . 
as far as taste goes , this is the best coconut water i 've tasted i have not tried all the other brands , so i am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants \( which i think is usually sweetened , so it really is n't a fair comparison \) , vitacoco , and amy and brian 's vitacoco uses brazilian coconuts while taste nirvana and amy and brian 's use thai coconuts it seems like taste nirvana and amy and brian 's are naturally sweeter than vitacoco , with taste nirvana being the sweetest this is a good sweet though , since all of these three brands have no sugars added while i 've liked all the coconut water i 've tasted , vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste , while taste nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness i liked the pulp as well , although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps i'm used to at some restaurants br br the only reason i took a star off is due to the price these 9 5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy taste nirvana in fact , at the current price this costs as much as i paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles for the best bargain on this brand , buy a href http www amazon com gp product b004ow342g taste nirvana real coconut water with pulp , 16 2 ounce \( pack of 12 \) a br br i wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say taste nirvana or amy and brian 's taste the best , and i 'd have to give my vote to taste nirvana hopefully some day i will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote , but if you 're like me and do n't have any coconut trees nearby , try this out enjoy ! . 
this is my favorite coconut water ! having traveled in asia and being able to get someone to climb a tree to harvest a coconut and then open it with a machete , nothing i found in the store came close until i found taste nirvana the other brands are mostly from brazilian coconuts , whereas this brand uses thailand coconuts and it makes a difference truly happiness in a bottle it 's a little pricey , but i ca n't get enough ! . 
i had coconut trees growing in my backyard in southeast asia , and enjoyed drinking coconut water right from the coconut itself taste nirvana real coconut water with pulp is the closest to the real thing that i 've found . 
imho there is simply not a better beverage on earth since i need to add some more words see prior sentence . 
this will ruin supermarket mustard for you high quality and just the right amount of bite so it allows the food to shine through . 
i have tasted one too many different mustards which claim to be spicy , but fall short this spreads easy and is neither too thick , nor too thin it actually does have enough heat to taste , without being excessive this mustard would make a great addition to any sauces , marinades , salad dressings , or just for dipping ! i would recommend this product , for anyone who is looking for a mustard with some true heat . 
a very tasty little cake the cake was surprisingly moist , and the caramel rum sauce was very sweet but not too overpowering we 'll definitely be buying this product again . 
the cake was a little smaller than i thought , but it was delicious my husband and i enjoyed it so much , we are ordering more for christmas ! . 
this tea actually tastes the way a rose smells it 's like sipping on roses when you drink it i'm glad it can be purchased on amazon because i looked in every regular food store as well as the more unusual stores , like trader joes , that carry unusual food items and could not find it . 
great sauce ! used in many jamaican restaurants to help with the heat of the jerk seasoning most use walkerwood jerk seasoning to make the jerk and pour this on later on the jerk or the rice . 
received order within 7 business days the product received did not have the same label as pictured though the wording was the same also the product did not have the same flavor as the product pictured \( which we had bought previously locally \) i suppose the manufacturer has not only changed the label for this product , but also the recipe the distributor provided excellent service and we have decided to keep the sauce we received , just have to make our own modifications for our grilled vegetable recipe we have used in the past thanks for another great distributor for the products we like a href http www amazon com gp product b001eo5zfq world harbors jamican style jerk sauce , 16 ounce bottle , \( pack of 6 \) a . 
i love this sauce ! it is sweet and molasses y , with a tiny kick of heat i use it to make hawaiian chicken or pork all the time i 've never had authentic jamaican jerk , so i ca n't vouch for accuracy there , but my whole family loves this one d . 
i love this sauce ! i used to get it at my local grocery store , but they 've stopped selling it i just ordered a six pack and it 's going to last a good long while most people i know that have tried this do n't like it , but i find the taste sweet and kind of zippy at the same time i have been trying to find a substitute for months ! i'm so glad i found this on amazon ! \) . 
we used to buy this sauce at our local grocery store which closed in september luckily , we were able to find it at amazon you do have to buy a 6 pack but the expiration date is march 2012 habanero peppers give it a kick even though it has no onions i'm allergic to onions so this is a welcome product very hard to find any good sauce with no onions . 
this sauce has just the right combination of sweet , spicy and mild heat that is perfect for using with a family the spicy is n't overpowered with allspice , the way some other brands are baste this on grilled pineapple for jerk turkey burgers and you 'll be in love too ! my only trouble is finding it in our small town stores have had to go to the internet , but it 's worth it . 
it 's not great plain , but it 's wonderful mixed with other herbs it can be a little bland if you do n't put anything but the rosehips in the infuser hibiscus goes great with it , though it 's a great tea for children because it 's mild and fruity , for adults add it to something else br also , you can eat the rosehips after they 've been brewed , sounds weird but they are great , they taste a little bit like an apple and have lots of vitamin c watch out for the pith \( that 's the best word i can think of for the little hairlike thorns that surround the seeds \) , though , if you decide to eat the hips every once in a while you find one that has n't been de pithed properly , hence you need to avoid the pith if you eat the brewed hips . 
these cloves are very finely ground and extremely pungent i use them in cooking , i let a small amount soak in coconut oil and use it for massage oil , and also mix it straight into beeswax for candles it works well on all counts i am very satisfied and will be reordering when needed . 
this mix is probably not something you would want to use everyday its just new enough and different enough to be something special to add to your summertime recipe 's when you want to reward yourself with something fun and fruity , this can fill the bill quickly and easily it has no aftertaste so often associated with diet drinks i highly recommend it . 
when i opened the package , i expect the same old tasting beef jerky but my taste buds surprised me this beef jerky tastes amazing ! i 've been buying products from amazon com for years was really inspired to leave any feedback but as soon as i tasted this beef jerky , i wanted everyone to know i just ordered 5 more \) br br baba ali . 
this is the best halal beef jerky i have ever tasted also the company truly gives an orthodox muslim a good choice in buying because when you call them to ask about their slaughtering process they quickly give you the answer unlike other muslim company 's who try do deceive the consumer . 
i am not muslim , but was interested in this jerky because of its low carb content compared to some other brands of sweet jerky out there it has a slightly sweet taste and great flavor \( spicy but not hot \) ! it is easy to chew and does n't leave your fingers sticky i wish it came in more economical sizes \( 6 , 9 , or 12 oz sizes \) , but that does n't seem to be the case it 's a great jerky and might just be addictive , which probably makes the 3 ounces bag size a good choice after the first 3 ounces you have to stop \( at least long enough to open another bag \) ! ! ! . 
well , after trying a lot of brands , this is probably the best beef jerky i ever tasted ! . 
great product and it tastes great i keep a bag in my drawer at work in case i get hungry and its great to eat to keep my protein count high since i'm working out . 
never had jerky before because i 've never seen a halal version was a little apprehensive at first but found it highly addictive went through a whole bag in one sitting i recommend all my curious muslim brothers and sisters to try it . 
amazing taste , incredible quality this is the best beef jerky i have ever had i think it 's even better than the other non halal ones this beef jerky made me leave my first review ever on amazon though i'm a regular costumer of theirs thumbs up ! . 
i do n't eat chips often , but when i do , these are some of my favorites they have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips , but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special the lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been dusted on some chips seem to have barely any flavor and i find myself looking for those with the most still , none of them have quite enough for my tastes i wish that these chips had more that just a hint of lime . 
product arrived on time , nicely packaged and gift wrapped , the treats were all quality and very good nice keepsake box . 
i got these for my mom who is always sucking on a cough drop these are gummi and are minty like a cough drop , she really likes them a unique gummi creation . 
this oil is wonderful i 've had almond oil that was so strong it overwhelmed what i was using it for \( salad , cooking \) i loved the flavor of this oil and will be buying more . 
as someone who goes through lots of thyme \( i use it in everything except cereal \) , i was pleasantly surprised to see this product on amazon at a very reasonable price looks , smells and tastes just like any other thyme but you can not beat not running to the grocery store and paying about 5 10x more for a tiny bottle which would last maybe 2 weeks in my house \) . 
good product and reasonable price compared with local store for people who use it everyday , it 's a great deal i would recommend it to everyone who loves thyme flavor . 
i have purchased several herbs from frontier which have been of good quality thyme leaf is always one of the most difficult to purchase due to the likely chance of recieving more stem than leaf this thyme leaf purchase was of average to good quality i did have about 30 70 , stem to leaf cut in the package , so i was satified with the selection when i dry my own thyme leaf , i usually do about the same or a little less stem to leaf ratio for cooking use stem of the thyme leaf are just as favorable as the leaf and can be used to cook with successfully . 
i was reading a news story about how lab research suggest a thyme tincture to be one of the most effective ways to fight acne \( better than a prescription \) i got 5 quart jars \( this amount is perfect for that many \) , 2 cheap bottles of vodka \( 80 proof \) filled each jar half way with thyme then topped it off with the vodka i'm still letting it sit \( it takes six weeks \) before it will be complete where i will then have to get cheese cloth and separate the thyme from the liquid and do a test run i 'll update with results mid may . 
i use a lot of various spices in my cooking and wanted to find a source with a quality product at a reasonable price frontier met that discription . 
this is the best olive oil not for cooking as any olive oil will work the flavor and aroma is fantastic brings you to italy use on salads breads for dipping . 
this item came exactly as described and shipped on time which is very important for christmas ! ! thanks for a reliable , easy shopping experience . 
i brought some of this back from a trip to jamaica and wished i had bought it by the gallon it is very hard to find but well worth ordering in bulk ! it is a sweet but spicy sauce that takes me back to jamaica with every taste i have attempted to duplicate it many times but ca n't seem to get it right i am ecstatic to finally have found a source . 
i bought this on a whim and wow do i consider myself lucky it was a shot in the dark , but this turned out to be one of the best hot sauces i have ever tasted not only has some good spicy heat , but excellent flavor as well it 's an unexpected mix of heat with a hint of sweet , and a very robust mix of spices one thing i really love about it is that it flavors whatever you put it on , but does not overwhelm it the heat is hot for sure , but does n't linger for very long the flavor is very original i went back to amazon and bought a whole case of it . 
i love jerk cooking , and this is the perfect jerk sauce to put over a freshly cooked piece of jerk chicken , pork , goat or beef each bottle does not last long at our house . 
pamela 's makes an awesome , delicious , easy to use wheatfree baking mix the 25 lb bag is clearly a wholesale product , coming in a brown paper bag without any fancy labels in january amazon was selling this product for 66 which was clearly an appropriate price for a wholesale item , especially if you compared it to the other sizes of the same baking mix now they are charging 82 for the exact same product which makes it more expensive than buying the same product offered as 3 of the 4 lb bags in the very pretty retail packaging something is n't right with this product offer , anymore shame on you amazon you 're supposed to be above such schemes ! br still , swear by pamela 's wheatfree baking pancake mix it 's the best . 
pamela 's all purpose mix is exactly what the gluten free folk out there need it 's like using regular white flour in almost everything every time i make a cookie , muffin , pancake , baked good , white sauce , etc it always turns out amazing ! i have been using this product for at least 16 years i only went gluten free about 2 years ago , but i used pamela 's products before going gf because i liked the taste of them ! . 
i love pamelas baking mix the 25 lb bag is quite large and the expiration is march 2 , 2010 , only 4 months after my purchase i will never be able to use that much baking mix in such a short amount of time not worth it . 
what can i say about this flour that wo n't make it look like i was paid to say it \? i have been using this flour since i was diagnosed with celiac disease six years ago i have worked as a gluten free lifestyle coach for gf diagnosed people for years helping them to adjust to the diet and pamela 's flour is one of the first things i steer them to it is a great all around gluten free flour it is not too light , like rice flour and not too heavy like a bean flour it does substitute well in all of my recipes it 's baking outcome is very desireable i have never had trouble with it in fact , many times the comments i get on my baked goods from my non gf friends is that they ca n't tell it 's gluten free br br now , to be fair , i need to mention that it does have dairy and nuts in it this is a problem for dairy and nut allergy persons and children this is the only drawback i see in this product unfortunately , i have not found something that i like as well to substitute for it . 
i am so excited about this product i have made paula dean 's apple cake \( half of the glaze \) , pancakes , thanksgiving dressing , muffins and cornbread using this gf baking mix in place of the plain flour , salt and baking powder they were excellent my non gf family enjoyed them tremendously the finished products were not gravely or grainy the taste was great br br if you have never tried this , test it out in the much smaller size it is wonderful . 
i have a cafe in talent , oregon i couldnt find this product wholesale anywhere this is so convienient and free shipping and it was here in just a few days ! ! my supplier could only get small amounts of inferior product and it would take 3 weeks thanks amazon ! . 
you can exchange this baking mix for regular flour in almost any recipe also makes yummy pancakes and waffles ! . 
my wife has celiac sprue which is a allergy to gluten in certain grains she was diagnosed with this disease about 8 years ago when she was first diagnosed , we could only purchase gluten free products from health food stores and it was very expensive as awareness about this disease has spread more companies are offering gluten free products in our search we stumbled across pamela 's my wife fell instantly in love with it the pancakes made from this flour are indistinguishable from wheat flour we made the jump and now the whole family is eating pamela 's to purchase it at the store is rather expensive did a web search and found it reasonably priced at amazon we will continue to purchase pamela 's in bulk until it is no longer offered great pancakes ! . 
growing up with wheat , i had an aversion to gluten free \( gf \) products but when my daughter exhibited sensitivities to gluten we thought we 'd give this a try both my wife and i were amazed at the waffles i typically made waffles from scratch but using this mix also saves a lot of time just add eggs , water , oil the subscribe and save 25 pound bag is the best value \( with free shipping \) , we will store unused product sealed in the freezer . 
i keep pamela 's baking mix in a 7 gallon container with a spin on bucket seal lid in the pantry br br when i want to make pancakes or waffles to start the day right i take a cup or two of mix , add a teaspoon of vanilla extract , an egg and olive oil and i'm ready to go what i enjoy most about purchasing the 25 lb bag is that it is easy to store and keeps fresh for months , yet is accessible and consistent in performance br br for a special treat i like to add hemp seed on the top of the waffles during cooking and fresh blueberries and strawberries before topping off with agave syrup . 
this is our second time purchasing the 25lb bag of pamela 's pancake and baking mix last time it came with a label with baking instructions , but this time it did n't good thing i had cut off my label and put it in the bucket with the pancake mix but other than that , this mix could n't be more perfect br since being diagnosed celiac and trying to balance gluten free gluten eating in the same kitchen with 7 people , we opted to move everyone gluten free at home this mix is a godsend and seriously , it tastes remarkable ! ! it is a real time saver and what we do instead of drive thru windows , these days i make a bunch and keep them in the freezer so they can be pulled out , toasted and made into a quick pb j for the kids i am so grateful to be able to purchase this is bulk as it makes gf eating much easier for our above average family size and keeps my kitchen gf ! ! . 
we use this flour for pancakes , muffins , biscuits and more i have found that this mix works great in all my old regular bisquick recipes we find the flavor to be similar to wheat flour we have subbed this flour into several wheat flour cookie recipes , leaving out the leavening called for , and only one has turned out unsatisfactorily , but not inedible definitely convenient and more affordable to our family of seven to be able to purchase in bulk . 
we go through pamela 's like crazy fantastic for pancakes \( we like to add a little vanilla to batter \) it also makes great chocolate chip cookies and banana bread the 25 lb bag is definately the best way to go value wise . 
my family and i are relatively new to gluten free and we have been in search of a baking mix to replace our weekend breakfasts we have tried several others and they all taste gluten free , if you know what i mean pamela 's however , is so good and you ca n't tell its gluten free try it , you wo n't regret it ! . 
this is exactly what i wanted it is much cheaper to buy it this way and not through a store thank you so much ! ! i'm new to the gluten free diet and this is perfect ! ! . 
the product arrived undamaged just as it was described on the website no delays and arrived quickly the customer was satisfied with the quality and arrival of order . 
when you have health issues taking gluten out of your diet is a good way to start , it may be the source of your problem , it has been in my case , and using pamela 's products has helped me get on the right track to feeling better . 
what 's not to like about pamela 's baking mix \? i use it as a base for a number of baked goods i have made biscotti and a wonderful lemon ricotta cake with pamela 's to name just a couple of things br br i got a little carried away with the last purchase i bought the 25 pound bag which means i wo n't have to order it again for a year ! br br for those that area curious about the pamela 's baking mix it 's a wonderful tasty base mix the waffles and pancakes it makes are delightful i really cannot say another bad about the baking mix nor amazon for bringing the larger bag option to us the consumer . 
i 've tried tons of gf pancake mixes i could choke on most of them or just decide not to ever eat pancakes again these are so moist and delicious my 92 year old grandmother was just diagnosed with celiac disease she loves them too my wife and children who are not gf also love them br m . 
it 's hard to find quality gf products , and pamela 's does n't dissapoint i always recommend this i go through a lot of this blend with a family of five amazon helps keep it more affordable the pancakes are great and the waffles are really good i have n't tried it with much else yet , but my sister in law does chocolate scones frequently with great raves i use the bread mix also all the time , and am very pleased with both . 
i started eating these after reading esselstyn 's popular book on heart disease \( heal through eating oatmeal \) there 's no way i can choke down cooked oat meal eating oatmeal cookies , on the other hand , is something i can swallow all of erin baker 's cookies appear to be made with oatmeal , and the three that i 've tried are palatable enough nevertheless , the fruit nut flavor was the one flavor of the three that i most looked forward to savoring each morning \( i hope it was n't because of lower oatmeal content than the other three \) br br in short , you do n't have to be the cookie monster to like these nor do you despite the fruit nut flavor have to be a little fruity \( to quote norman bates' audible thoughts in hitchcock 's psycho \) or a health nut to find these tasty and nutritious maybe even therapeutic \( dr esselstyn would seem to think so \) and the advantage of the mini size is that you might feel better less guilty , at least about knocking off two instead of just one cookie at a time . 
i like them as a midmorning snack with a cup of coffee they are also great for those mornings you really are n't in the mood for breakfast , but know you 'll be hungry later they seem to keep you satisfied for an hour or two they do taste great not too sweet and not overly cake like buy a bunch and keep them in the freezer until you need more . 
if you want a quick pick me up in a small package , each one individually wrapped this is my choice ! i have one in the car mid compartment , and in my briefcase they would be great and a pre aerobic workout snack great flavor , moist not too sweet beware if you are allergic to nuts these are out i took them out of the box and divided into zip lock bags and froze when i needed more i just pulled one bag from the freezer and it worked out great . 
breakfast cookies are a favorite with the young children \( ages 6 and 9 \) of a friend these one ounce cookies are the right size for young children the are individually wrapped , and can be used at home or as a take along snack item they can also be used as special treats on occasions like halloween . 
erin baker 's products are a favorite for my family the breakfast cookie mini 's are great for snacks coffee breaks and especially good for traveling br this is a denser product than a regular cookie , nice and chewy and filling with only 100 calories . 
my kids \( 4yrs and 1 1 2yrs \) love these cookies , much to my surprise ! the mini ones are just right for them and i'm happy to give them 'cookies' for breakfast ! there are 2 things i do n't like 1 \) the individual cookie packages are very hard to open i always need scissors and 2 \) the cookies fall apart easily i would n't recommend passing these out in the car ! br overall a great product and i purchased these in bulk so we are sure to always have them on hand . 
we love erin baker 's breakfast cookies br br that said , the small mini 's are the first time that we have had a problem \( problem \) with about 1 3 of them being moldy or having mold on them br br storage has not been an issue when we got them \( within 1 2 an hour \) , they were placed into the freezer until use as we use the cookies we take them from the freezer to the microwave \( for a quick warm up \) however , still i am fearful each time i rip into a small package , that i will find mold either on the top or sides of the cookie br br this is , obviously , not conducive to enjoyment while eating them br br we have never had this problem with any of the the big cookie variety br br update 02 15 12 today i opened my door to find a box sent to me from erin baker 's and it had 2 boxes of fresh double chocolate chunk minis \( the exact amount that i had found to be moldy in my original order \) amazing company check out the comments attached to my review to see how this all came about top marks to this company not only fabulous breakfast cookies , but amazing customer service \( which they volunteered i did not ask for ! ! ! \) . 
i was expecting hard tasteless healthy cookies it is soft , a little chewy and yummy very tasty . 
these are excellent they taste great and are just the right size two can make an on the go breakfast that is tasty and good for you the larger size breakfast cookies are just too big 2 of these are perfect my husband had gotten out of the habit of eating breakfast too much trouble but since i bought these he is good about grabbing one or two on the way out the door . 
i love these cookies and i love erin as a result these cookies make me smile the texture makes my eyes googly the smell reminds me of beautiful spring days and how awesome it 'd be to spend them with erin , have her bring the fresh cookies out of the oven and us enjoying them together on our outdoor swing listening to the birds and enjoying the creek that passed through our backyard br br the only thing is that this kind and the other kind \( raisin \) do n't differ much in taste they both taste the same taste of heaven . 
i live in the area where these cookies are made , and i remember buying them from local coffee stands when they first started making them years ago each one was wrapped in saran wrap and had a handwritten label on them the packaging has changed , and there are many different flavors available now , but the original breakfast cookie still tastes just as good today as those first ones did br br the smaller size is great for a snack , as the large ones are enough for two people ! full of good stuff , not too sweet it 's a treat that you can feel good about . 
erin baker's organic breakfast cookies are delicious and moist i am truley enjoying them each cookie is individually packaged there great for throwing in your lunch , work , school or driving on a trip although , she makes different kinds i find the fruit nut is a favorite so if you like a oatmeal cookie that's wholesome , deliicous , moist then this is the one it's a winner ! ! ! . 
of the erin baker products , the fruit nut mini breakfast cookie is my favorite ! i have one mini breakfast cookie \( about 100 calories \) with a cup of coffee in the morning and i feel satisfied and ready to start the day very healthy , low in caloreis , and super delicious is what makes the product work for me try it , you 'll like it . 
if you are looking for a rich chocolate cookie look somewhere else but if you are looking for a fairly good tasting 100 calorie breakfast or snack these are pretty good . 
i 've been having these cookies for about 4 years , and l love it , but i can not find them , in the store where i used to buy , i live in san diego , so i would like to buy them here , thaks . 
if you want to treat your tastebuds to the ultimate delight , try dulce de leche and this brand is the best ! as a native of argentina , i grew up with this stuff and no imitation comes close serve it inside crepes slightly warm folded and with powder sugar , with flan or ice cream and remember a little goes a long way very sweet ! . 
a friend brought me this from argentina and my kids and i ate it with a spoon and then apples so that i would feel less guilty when we finished , i immediately panicked because i was n't sure if i could get it here in the u s low and behold i found it on amazon it is different packaging but same company so i assume it is just catering to americans delicious ! . 
i think this is the best dulce de leche i ever tried i discovered at the llao llao hotel in bariloche \( argentina \) on a recent trip they serve it at breakfast there . 
just an outstanding product br br an authentic dulce de leche ranked number one in argentina for its exceptional richness and depth of flavor br br made at a small dairy outside of buenos aires br br \( note that the web page or supplier indicates made in spain but this product is clearly made in argentina \) . 
i was born in argentina and this is a top of the line dulce de leche , to eat with toasts or as add on to cakes \( comparable to chimbote \) br br note i noticed that dulce de leche is an acquired taste so unless you grew up eating it , you may consider dulce de leche to be a little too sweet . 
my father grew up in argentina and since he came to the states has been searching for the perfect dulce de leche that reminded him of his childhood he does n't have to search anymore , i bought him a couple of jars this past christmas and he has been a happy camper ever since . 
we used to have a pipeline to get homemade dulce de leche from a bonafide argentine , but alas , said pipeline moved away this is the next best thing and does n't involve me hanging out in the kitchen for hours while my milk caramelizes . 
i am so glad i ordered this it is the best dulce de leche i have been able to find i had read about this somewhere and am now convinced that many people are not familiar with this product if you like anything caramel , you 'll love this ! . 
very high quality dulce de leche from argentina compared to most brands , it 's a bit lighter colored , and the taste is more subdued and milkier you may or may not appreciate this , as it 's not the classic taste that you expect from commercial dulce de leche , but it 's by far the closest to the homemade dulce that my grandma used to make for this , i 'd give it 6 stars if i could ! . 
i bought this for my girlfriend as she had been having tummy issues and she absolutely loves it now it seems assumed i will keep her in stock that alludes to a completely different product review the point is , buying it in bulk grants the obvious versatility of making tea bags when on the go or strainers when home it seems very economical without sacrificing quality in the least my only wish is that they would institute the subscribe and save feature here for those who are hooked and are loyal customers my gf usually gets what she wants . 
this is a good quality product , which definitely helps tame my tummy i have it each evening and it makes a huge difference in how i feel definitely recommended , along with heather 's acacia fiber , which is life changing . 
i was n't much of a tea drinker until i bought a 'breville' automatic tea maker and a bag of tummy tea fennel for my wife she started brewing the first pot of this new tea and did it ever smell great a little like licorice we both shared that pot and have been hooked ever since this is one of those teas that makes you just feel warm and fuzzy all over it is a feeling you do not forget if i was stranded on a desert island and could only have one tea this would be it br br for those who enjoy drinking tea i would encourage you to look into the 'breville' tea maker produced by a german firm it is without a doubt an indispensible tool for brewing tea the price for this mechanical marvel is a little high but believe me it is worth every penny . 
i love tea , hot or cold , and am always looking to try new ones this tea brews up a wonderful cup just opening the bag to scoop some out is a joy the smell alone is captivating i tried a cup to relieve a stomach ache and it relieved my discomfort immediately it really does taste just like good quality licorice and it 's naturally sweet when my urge for sweets hits , i can now reach for this tea instead and it really does satisfy my cravings this tea will be a staple in my pantry . 
i think this is a really good deal i seal it up in a rubbermaid container and just scoop it out to brew good stuff ! . 
live with digestive problems , and you eat a lot of mint mint lozenges , mint tea , and those 'curiously strong' mints you can get tired of the taste of mint especially in the morning i gave up coffee months ago , \( and i still whimper some mornings \) , so i'm looking for some kind of substitute forget decaf anything forget chocolate forget tea some people swear by hot water with lemon i do n't too acid this fennel tea sells elsewhere as 'tummy tamer tea ' it does it 's better than chamomile tea , which does n't do much for me in terms of flavor or calming anything br br i 've used this fennel tea in desperation those mornings when nothing else will settle in when even mint leaves or herbal teabags of mint leaves are too much , this goes down nicely but if you 're not a fan of vegetable soup or celery , this might take a little getting used to me , i like it the smell reminds me of hops . 
the fennel smells fresh , tastes good , and makes a great addition to one of my tea blends it is packaged exactly as shown in the picture came in a timely manner thanks ! . 
i love gummy bears love i also love to eat healthy , and for me that means avoiding corn syrup whenever possible i was sent these gummy bears by accident when i ordered the sour gummy bears \( also by surf sweets \) and i am glad i was , as these are absolutely delicious they have the same texture as regular gummy bears , though if you let them warm up a little bit or get an off batch they may be a little bit chewier some find them a little bit sweeter than regular gummy bears , but i think that is due to the lack of corn syrup i do n't really notice any difference note that these do still contain gelatin , so vegans should not eat this \( i think that their jelly beans and the gummy worms are safe for vegans \) the natural fruit juice flavors are delicious , and the fact that you get your vitamin c as well is just an added bonus i would definitely recommend these , though i suggest you get these small bags over the large ones as otherwise you might find yourself eating the whole thing in one go ! br br one last caveat if you are on a budget i suggest you go with the surf sweets sour gummy bears \( also available on amazon \) as they are ten dollars cheaper i'm still unsure of the reason for the price difference , but if you 're on a budget the other ones are great too ! . 
these are guaranteed to be a hit with my kids br like regular gummy bears , but even better with extra flavor br perfect consistency not too chewy great all the way around . 
my four kids love these , it 's great that there 's zero nasty stuff in it like grocery store 'fruit' \( ie total chemical junk \) snacks a 'safe' kid snack ! . 
these are always delicious a much healthier alternative to most candies kid 's sugary snacks the size is perfect for goodie bags even fits in large easter eggs . 
i found these little awesomely delicious fruit snacks at a gluten free show in wisconsin the guy that was there offered me a package and i fell in love ! they are organic , which makes them all the more cool , and they are very , very tasty ! i looked on the ingredients and was surprised to find no high fructose corn syrup ! they 're a little chewy at first , but i can not find anything else wrong with them they are a wonderful fruit snack that i do n't feel guilty about eating afterwards ! . 
my 18 month old grandson only eats organic foods , and i was looking for a treat to give him when he visits he loves these candies , and i do n't feel too guilty because they are in a tiny packet with only a few in each one they stay at grandma 's and grandpa 's house ! \( of course we brush his teeth afterwards \) . 
you cant go wrong with rosa monte especial ! this is one of the best yerbas in argentina go for it seller did everything ok , in time and etc ! . 
i switched to mate from coffee a few years ago i know it 's generally an afternoon drink , but i drink it in the morning like coffee there were a couple of websites where i bought it regularly unfortunately , dr oz saw fit to publicly endorse it as a health tea , and the price went up everywhere , including my regular sellers so i went looking , and found this on amazon br br this is my favorite brand the selecci oacute n especial is aged two years in special wooden boxes with vents to let smoke in this is elaborada con palo , meaning that it has stem bits in it , which makes the flavor last longer for more refills some will prefer sin palo \( without stems \) , because the stems also add a little bitterness to the mate br br i understand that in argentina , where mate is a common as coffee is here , rosamonte is generally regarded as one of the best commercially available mate brands br br of this seller in particular , i can say that they were prompt , and that the box came with a couple free samples of flavored mate a lot of people will prefer the flavored kinds , especially either citron which is lemon , or hierbes de monta ntilde a , which means moutain herbs and tastes like mint br br i , however , prefer this for day to day consumption i run plain water through the coffee maker , fill a large coffee cup about 1 3 full with mate , and just keep topping it up with hot water for a couple hours as i sip it through the bombilla br br the main thing that pleased me about this merchant is that the product was considerably less dusty than what i had been getting from my previous suppliers the difference is probably about handling and storage the bags are like a bag of sugar , and a lot of rough handling could crush the leaves inside , creating dust in the mate , dust gets through the holes in the bombilla and coats your tongue , tastes a little bitter , and generally degrades the experience br br when it first arrived , i opened a bag and poured it into a big tupperware container that i use to store it and i immediately noticed that there was very little dust compared to what i had been getting when i ordered this from my old seller br br i'm very happy with what i received . 
packages came in soft container that had been crushed and one was split open i was worried about how fresh it would be but its aged so no worries the mate is flavorful and strong i do n't have much to compare it too but at 30 00 for 3 kilos \( 6 6 lbs \) it seems to be a fantastic deal with a a good product br br not organic , kind of a bummer , but pretty much expected i would get this again but i will probably try another more expensive , organic version and see if i can taste any difference . 
rosamonte especial can never let you down tastes fresh and strong i smell argentina in every sip yerba mate is going through an increase in prices , almost double crazy but it 's worth the value i will never change rosamonte especial ! . 
if you 're setting out a whole can at once or transferring some of it to a container for later use , flip the can over and use a can opener to remove the bottom of the can you can then pop the top of the can , releasing the vacuum holding the food in place and the whole thing will slide out cleanly much easier and tidier than scraping out the can with a spoon ! . 
i 've been feeding wellness grain free for a couple years now with great results for my 3 cats i believe the cost of a top quality food is well worth it in healthy , happy cats and reduced vet bills , but still the cost of wellness has been prohibitive i was excited to see felidae had a grain free formula in the larger sized cans , and for a much lower price , so i am trying it just switched them over this week , so far so good the bowls have been licked clean , and while i questioned the whole peas when i saw them , they were n't left in the bowl the ingredients and quality of the felidae seems comparable to the wellness , so unless i find information indicating otherwise \( and i 've been looking \) , i think we 'll stick with felidae . 
i have 5 house cats one was recently diagnosed with diabetes we got his diabetes under control with insulin but i began researching diet information to help us all of my research led us to try felidae grain free i spent two weeks carefully switching louis \( and the four girls \) from dry iams to felidae i was immediately able to decrease his insulin and by the time i had him totally on felidae we were able to discontinue insulin totally all with our veterinarian 's supervision , a consistent feeding schedule and measured amounts \( it has not been effortless but it has been worthwhile \) louis has been insulin free for two weeks now all five cats \( ages 5 to 19 \) love the food their stools are good , their coats look wonderful they have n't vomited for weeks yay ! . 
this cat food has great , healthy ingredients cats should n't eat grain because it is not a part of their traditional diet \( think mice , rodents , moles , grasses , rabbits , bird , etc \) i switched my cat from iam 's canned food to this one , thinking that i would have to mix them together at first to get her to eat it however , she ate it immediately ! i was so happy ! as another reviewer said , there are whole peas in this stuff it looks a little gross , but my cat eats it however , i must admit that she will eat just about anything her favorite treats are sproated oat grass , spinach and broccoli stalks she 's a good eater ! br br before i switched to felidae grain free , my cat was vomiting frequently i think it was due to food allergies \( either to grain or food coloring maybe \) since switching she has only thrown up one time ! you can only imagine how happy i am to not have to clean up vomit every other day ! br br also , since switching my cat 's fur is much more smooth and soft ! . 
no more dry kibble for our felines ! ! ! after a few medical emergencies and educating myself why cats are not designed by mother nature to eat dry kibble \( any brand \) , i changed our clan of felines to healthy wet food br every cat with a blocked urinary tract is fine , until they start to strain to urinate and have to be rushed to the er br with all the issues of recalls and such concerning the pet food industry , we rotate 3 different brands of food felidae is one it has no grains , soy , corn , or icky fillers felidae is a pate loaf like consistency br since changing to a wet food only diet , none of our cats have been back to er in years none throw up no runny eyes coats are shiny no matted hair all are at a perfect weight the changes are amazing br having 5 cats , i am very thankful for the 13 oz size cans of felidae br i had a question recently and sent felidae an email they answered very promptly and were very kind their customer service deserves 5 stars also . 
i 'd been feeding them wellness until the recent recall after checking some reviews , i looked around for something comparably healthy in the large size cans and decided to give this a shot they 're always enthusiastic at mealtimes , but they 've been literally climbing over each other at mealtimes for this one caveat unlike the wellness it has a pull tab , which is good news bad news no need to mess with a can opener , but it 's absolutely impossible to get it out without a spoon or a huge mess . 
great price and my cat loves this food he has been on it for 9 years my vet says he is the healthest cat he sees . 
my youngest cat goes insane over this stuff ! \( which is good she 's the reason we had to seek out a new food that was for both adults and kittens \) my older cat took a few weeks to adapt to the creamier texture , compared to her favorite canned food , although she loved the taste right away once she got used to it , we started going through this case like it was going out of style and i had to buy more ! i have noticed much less smelly litter boxes since we got into this case , compared to many of the foods we use that was a big bonus for me , and enough to convince me to put this into our regular rotation of canned foods . 
i have the coolest different cats ever with some exotic in them and this stuff is amazing and really they seem to love it ! it does not make the poo smell bad and the digestive system of some of mine do not tolerate much grain or gluten so that is very much a plus ! the price on amazon is better for a large can \( amount per ounce \) than i can find at local pet shops or stores so when you can get the free shipping it is really awesome to have pet foods at your door service too ! i hope amazon will just continue to make pet food supplies to your home affordable and at a top price ! sometimes though when i go to try to re order cannot find \( the same deals \) available so i just lurk and watch and wait sometimes til it is offered again to make it affordable not sure why that happens but i know i have to \( watch it \) to make sure i do n't end up with a high shipping fee in my cart prior to purchase . 
cats do occasionally need a little green in their diet not a whole lot , but their typical prey in the wile would probably have vegetation in their stomachs when killed and eaten that being said , my kitties are weird and love to eat vegetables i have a toddler that likes to throw his food around so inevitably some ends up on the floor , and they are there to pounce when it falls ! the ingredients in this food are wholesome , my kitties eat this food whole peas and all , and it makes their coats wonderfully soft and silky this is not the only wet food i feed them , but it is one i do plan on keeping in their wet food rotation i give it my solid recommendation . 
we recently adopted a new kitten we rotate felidae grain free canned formula with wellness turkey canned food he loves both and eats well , he 's never left a single whole pea behind this is a very high quality cat food , using excellent all meat proteins he is healthy , active , affectionate , and has a smooth glossy coat definitely worth the cost in the long run br br i believe it is worthwhile to rotate different \( high quality \) canned foods for variety and to not create a cat who will only eat one brand i think this is useful also in the event of a recall i'm looking for a 3rd high quality brand to add to the rotation . 
i adopted my adorable edmund last year from a shelter they sent me home with a small bag of felidae \( not grain free version \) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time br i am very concerned about eating healthy whole foods , so i of course want the best for my kitty as well i did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains fruits vegetables directly , and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey 's stomachs \( ie if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it \) so i wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what 's found in nature as possible , without breaking the bank br he already seemed to really like the felidae grain included version , so as soon as my starter bag ran out i immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has only eaten this ever since i got him he loves it ! br i give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz felidae grain free food \( we 've tried both the turkey chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and edmund prefers the turkey chicken but will eat anything i give him \) \) i bought some can lids at petsmart , and they seal air tight on these cans so fridge storage is clean and easy br br he has the absolute softest , shiniest fur coat i have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy we have n't had a single vet visit since i adopted him \( even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when i got him , they all cleared up \) i have to blame at least some of all this on the fact he only eats grain free felidae food \( the rest is because i love him so ridiculously much ! \) br br i love the free shipping on amazon \( i buy a case of canned and a bag of dry \( or two of one \) at the same time \) ! i used to buy this elsewhere , and since it 's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product ! . 
this yuban dark roast is outstanding it is smooth with a chocolaty taste i find it as good as any far more expensive coffees i would also recommend purchasing the 11 ounce cannisters because the coffee is freshest when you can pop open a new can and use it up without refrigerating or freezing it br br i do not like many dark roasted coffees because i do n't like the burnt taste yuban dark roast has no burnt or bitter taste definitely shun the regular roast for this one br br also , keep in mind that this review is written by someone who thinks starbucks is far , far overrated \( bitter , burnt \) . 
if you like strong coffee , this is it ! the flavor is exceptional , i have not found better in a can this can be expensive and difficult to find at your local store i have had great luck with amazon , good price for the subscription order \( you can get a case a couple times a year and still get the reduced rate \) amazon also has a wonderful return policy ! br try yuban if you love strong coffee and have not found the coffee for you , this may be it ! we have been drinking it for 10 years now have had the original , organic and dark roast i dont have a preference , they are all excellent . 
my husband and i are always searching for better coffee and seemingly there seems to be something wrong with them all ! lol i have finally decided that yuban is without fail my favorite coffee it has no aftertaste , is not bitter in any way and it remains constant can after can on that note , my husband can go grabbing different can after and grinding himself silly if he wishes complaining about each one i'm settled on yuban forevaaaaaaa \) . 
excellent we have enjoyed yuban coffee for many years we recently tried the dark roast coffee and would recommend it if you want a rich tasting coffee smooth with no bitterness beats the high price of many gourmet coffees without sacrificing that delicious flavor that coffee lovers look for . 
yuban makes the best cup of coffee either roast is never bitter , and makes a great cup of coffee we like our coffee extra strong , and we have been using yuban for years the coffee is very consistent and distinctive br br this is the best canned ground coffee out there , period we have found none to match the true dark , smooth cup of coffee there is no bitterness or burnt taste , just silky , rich coffee add a dab of half n half , and you have bliss in a cup br br do n't spend your money on the expensive designer coffees this is the best ! br br if you are persnickety about coffee , buy yuban ! . 
living in baton rouge my wife and i drank the popular regional coffee community coffee , we now guess out of loyalty when we became full time rv'ers in february 2007 , we packed 5 lbs of that coffee but ran out in missouri , so we tried other dark roast , including maxwell house gourmet dark roast and then the yuban dark roast omg what a difference ! br br we 'll never buy anything except yuban dark road smooth and silky without that burnt or bitter taste br br difficult to find in south louisiana , but easier nationwide then there 's always amazon with delivery within 5 days ! br br ya gotta try it ! . 
i can only say that this is great coffee , never tried before until recently now i like it better than folgers ! . 
until recently i thought that coffee was coffee but apparently it 's not that simple drinking coffee can either be an good habit for the environment or a very bad one br br the good news is , going green is easy ! look for the certification by environmental watch dogs like the rainforest alliance and keep up the demand for arabica \( uh ra bih kuh \) or rainforest blend coffee just ask for them at your local grocery store or favorite coffee house br br gogreenmart more voted yuban as a product of the week because the great taste helps wake you in the morning and protects the environment as well . 
we had not been able to find the dark roast yuban in any of the stores recently when i ordered this they gave me a date of receipt it actually came two days earlier my husband was so excited when he saw what i had ordered thanks for the quick service on a great product . 
i own a small night club and this is , hand 's down , the most popular snack item we have at first we were just giving it away until we started going through way too much of it to justify that anymore in addition it is not available anywhere in town and , before we found it here , we had to go to a sam 's club 50 miles away to stock up on it apparently it is about as close to being the perfect blend for a wide variety of tastes as one could expect to find the company also makes a club mix , as opposed to the pub mix i made the mistake of buying a huge supply of that and met will strong and continued ire from our clientele they look about the same but apparently the club mix lacks some vital ingredient . 
i received a whole package of this delicious , tasty , perfectly seasoned mix that contains just the correct variety of snacks \( pretzels , crackers , nuts , etc \) of course , here in iraq we look forward to receiving care packages and the awesome snacks they contain however , this snack was the cat 's meow it is honestly the best snack mix i have ever tasted and my fellow marines agree on this also once it was eaten by all , everyone was inquiring where i had received it and i could only say a caring patriot who included it in one of their care box of goodies br br i loved it so much that i ended up on this page because i decided to go online and search for it , and see if i can get multiple packages of this shipped to my unit here in iraq i do n't mind paying a few extra bucks for it , to have for me and my fellow marines to enjoy it 's just that good that it 's worth it ! ! ! br br this is a great product and all should try it after you do , you wo n't think that chex mix can light even a dim candle next to the utz pub mix believe me , try it , and you 'll want to keep this stocked in your cabinet for everyone in your family and their friends to enjoy . 
i found these tubs at costco and was dismayed to discover that they are no longer carrying them i buy the 4 pack here at amazon and i am very satisfied the snacks are tasty not too salty and offers a variety of chips in the mix that all blend nicely . 
this is definitely the best snack mix i have ever had ! it got me and my buddies through many movie nights while deployed in iraq . 
i agree with all who have said that this is a great snack , but i just wanted to say that i piad 36 95 for a 4 pack of 30 oz containers from the actual utz site . 
i tasted this snack at my local pub and found it tasty much better than chips or other mixes i was told it was sold in sam 's club and wegman 's for 18 per 30 0z container bought it from utz in a 4 pack for 41 00 br each piece has a different taste and texture could not ask for a more delicious snack or a better price thank you utz ! . 
hands down , the best snack you will ever voraciously consume at a potentially unhealthy pace br br it does contain msg , so do be warned , but if that does not dissuade you \( as it would never me \) , give this a shot this has been a godsend during road trips , movie knights , parties , and general get togethers of all kinds . 
enjoyed the product and they also provided very fast shipping i'm about out and need to order more . 
this mix is great anytime i love it would recommend it to anyone that likes chex mix . 
i absolutely love this mix we keep it on our home bar and everyone loves it . 
i found this mix at the ft myer commissary i looked for this product last time i visited the commissary and could not find it so here i am online looking and found it here i could eat this all day i 've tried several different snack mixes , but most have too many pretzels this has a very nice balance of flavors and textures and not a lot of pretzels i'm stocking up ! ! . 
this is an addicting , fantastic snack mix it has a wonderful variety of crackers and blend of flavors . 
cat grass seeds will sprout very easily you can sprinkle them on top of any kind of moisture retaining soil or peat moss my cats eat the sprouts very quickly i suggest that you purchase multiple seed packs i did so to insure that i would have more sprouts ready when the first wave was gobbled the only drawback is shipping cost which is more than the seed packets themselves that 's another reason to order in multiples the shipping cost for several packages is the same as for a single packet . 
this is good stuff however , i planted it , and no cats grew up just grass . 
cat grass is not only a treat that cats love to eat , it is also good for them and will help deter them away from eating houseplants ! my cat often nibbles on houseplants then throws up and i'm always afraid that it will do damage to her digestive system when there is cat grass around , though , she only eats that she really chows it down , and it makes her happy , too ! cat grass is also good for cats it contains vitamins that may or may not be present in cat food , and it aids their digestive system and helps to eliminate fur balls br br even if you do not have a green thumb , cat grass is so easy to grow , that anyone can do it and it 's also a great project for kids , too the seeds sprout very quickly \( if you keep them moist \) and will grow quickly to 4 6inches in a window sill br br if you have cats , cat grass is a must ! . 
i 've had luck with this seed and all the other packets i 've purchased from botanical interests \( the company that makes it \) br right now , the packet 's over a year old and i recently planted another pot and had a high germination rate in about two days and it was about three inches tall in four days br the cats love it they ate so much i planted yet another pot br having the grass around deters our cats from gnawing on strange things , like plastic , especially when they are having digestive problems . 
great product the indoor kitties love to have grass to nibble on this grass grows and is ready to nibbling in 10 days or less br my how to br get a small , shallow plastic container with a lid br punch several holes in the bottom of the container with a nail br fill the container with organic soil , sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of seeds on top , pack the seeds into the soil by pressing them in firmly w br ater until some of kit leaks out the holes in the bottom br place on a dish put on the lid keep out of the way for the seeds to germinate checking to water every 3 days br once the grass has grown about 2 inches , remove the lid and place in the sun br put grass in a new heavier bowl so the cats ca n't pull the entire patty of grass out or walk off with the container with they nibble it . 
yum , i am so happy my mom bought this delicious and nutritious cat grass for me ! it helps me digest my food , and is just fun to poke around in when i'm bored and i notice that mom eats it too \( when she thinks i'm not looking ! \) because it is so tasty ! . 
i use this to grow my cat grass every month or so now that it 's spring i can find the terra cotta pots at the stores again i just keep two and alternate so he always has grass growing he loves it , so i bought several packs at once , probably more than i 'll need ! i get several batches out of each packet none have been duds so far either . 
cat grass , also known as wheat grass , is a great plant for anyone i typically do n't do any type of gardening , but i had no trouble getting these seeds to sprout and grow these seeds make a great project for gardeners , cat lovers , and children , too br br the hardest part of caring for these plants is keeping your cats from keeping from devouring them completely ! that 's what happened to mine , at least , and my cats still several months later will check the area where i kept the cat grass for more of this tasty plant . 
received this product much sooner than promised seeds grow as claimed and plant is great my cat loves it highly recommend product and seller . 
this stuff is awesome ! br br grows very fast and grows into a full grass section br br my cat loves it and with other cat grasses i have purchased , she has vomited after sometimes , but this stuff she hasnt \( so far \) br br like another reviewer said shipping for one package is same price if you buy 10 , so stock up and save on shipping , and the package was very nice , wasnt just thrown in an envelope ! . 
we have been buying cat grass for many years and this product is very well priced and works just as good as the expensive packages br br our cats have grown healthy and happy since they have this grass br br great seller delivered on time and product sold is exactly what we wanted and will purchase again . 
so , these seeds do exactly as advertised i bought 10 paks of seeds , and have so far used 4 i always get a pot full of strong , bright green grass , which my cat readily devours not much else can be said good deal , good grass man . 
i have been growing this cat grass for my 3 little dog , however i do n't have the nerve to tell them this is for cats i noticed our dogs would occasionally chew grass at the park or leaves from trees , considering the chemicals that may be used on other plants i decided to grow my own br my little guys love this stuff , but there is one problem being dogs they can be a little messy and they tend to want to rip the grass right out of the pot roots all i have taken to trimming the grass daily and placing it next to their water bowl br trimming just seems to stimulate the grass to grow faster , much like your lawn as with your lawn i find that adding nutrients \( iron \) to the grass it keeps it 's beautiful color and many months of fresh new grass br do n't know the exact reason my dogs like grass , it might be just like humans we like a salad for a change maybe it just add something that is missing from their diets guess you might say dogs ca n't live on meat alone or something like that . 
i planted this grass and in 8 days i had 3 4 inches of grass ! br br the price hurts since you 're basically paying for shipping the cost of the seeds themselves are 1 59 as shown on the package i could n't find oat grass seeds at lowes or my local independent garden center i'm hoping to find somewhere local to buy them so i can buy more seeds in the future without having to pay a premium and wait for them to ship . 
the grass sprouted quickly , with a great germination rate the cats love it , so much that they tried to get to it by knocking it off the mantle while i was out of town the pot was upside down for at least a day , and it looked like the grass was all going to die however , a week later it has almost fully recovered , so it 's pretty hearty . 
our cats love the grass it 's easy to grow and it sprouts within a few days so you have an ample supply on hand continually an excellent product to maintain a cat 's health . 
i wanted to grow some cat grass for my kitty to distract him from my other plants in the house i planted them in a large window sill box with potting soil i had a large bunch of grass in about a week my cat loves it and it looks great in my kitchen . 
i normally purchase already grown containers of cat grass at my local pet store however , the last few pots developed bugs in them , which just was n't sanitary i bought these seeds from hirts and they grew insanely fast ! my cats love the taste i 've already bought another pack so i can re plant once the cats finish off this batch . 
these seeds grow very easy , one seed pack grew about 7 little pots i would grow using a few seeds about every 4 5 days in 2 separate little pots for my cats so they never was without a great buy . 
excellent germination ! only 4 days and about 90 of the seeds are up to an inch if i had n't done this before , the instructions would have been wonderful , they left nothing out i will buy these again . 
this was the only seed pack i bought of three different brands that came up and the cats are still enjoying . 
tiger loves the cat grass it only takes about a week after the grass is planted to come up so it grows very fast i planted it in a pot outside it did very good outside . 
it was so easy to grow and my cat loved it i highly recommend this purchase your cat will love you forever ! . 
unfortunately , bunnies love it , too , so we are having to grow this batch of cat grass indoors the cats love this stuff just put it where they can reach it and they will go to town on it , munching it all up it does not make them behave erratically , like catnip does , so do n't worry about that you do n't have to do anything to these seeds other than press them into some moist soil and water when the soil starts to become dry and crumbly that 's it ! a nutritious treat for your cats ! . 
these seeds always grow , unlike some other brands every single one of my cats totally loves the resulting oat grass there is nothing else that all five of them all agree on so unanimously br br thanks for such a great batch of seeds ! . 
in less than a week , my kitties had grass to much on i was surprised with their reaction to it , it seemed like she was given this before at her previous home she rushed right to it as soon as she saw it and gnawed it down to nothing the first time it got eaten , the plants sprang back to life and grew faster than before , but after being annihilated a second time , the grass kind of dried up and died which is okay , because i have plenty more seeds in the pack . 
excellent product and price would do business with this company again br my cat loves it ca n't wait to plant it again . 
the true test is that our cats really loves the grass we grow from these seeds ! and they grew very easily in pots , too . 
i bought 4 packets and planted one of them it only took a couple of days for the sprouts my cats love it ! . 
my two cats must not be interested in grass , because it grew but they ignored it had no problems growing it . 
this product is great for growing cat grass gives a hearty grass is easy fast growing will purchase in the future . 
it got here fast , grew quickly and my cats love it excellent choice anyone can make their cats very happy by purchasing this product , plus my cats have completely stopped chewing on all other plants in the house . 
our cat loves to eat this grass and it was so easy to grow too i have never been much into growing plants but this was easy and actually useful rather than just grow plants around the house recommended product . 
i have 3 cats 2 could care less the other one loves this so much i have it by their food bowls and she nibbles on it every day no throwing up like outside grass . 
i have 3 cats here at home and they need to dosome grazing so i baught this to see if they like it \) even though its just out grass lol . 
i just picked these up at random at my local asian market , and i am really impressed i 'd drive the 15 20 minutes there again just to pick these up they have an excellent coffee flavor and are n't horribly sweet like most hard candies each candy is individually wrapped and lasts a good long time . 
great candy ! sweet and intense , low calorie and delightful made with actual coffee , not just flavoring fantastic reasonably priced too . 
japanese sweet but strong black coffee candy lasts a long time in your mouth and costs alot less on amazon than elsewhere made with real caffeinated coffee for a little energy . 
there is nothing wrong with this product , but it is overpriced with a little research you can buy this for less than half the price buyer beware . 
my cats really love this 9 lives seafood and poultry cat food br they prefer this pate to the slices or chunks br they are a perfect weight and have beautiful shiny coats br and lots of energy br it is good quality food and is very fresh . 
we enjoy these peanut butter and jelly bars my 5 year old with celiac disease says he can have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich again he loves to pack these for school snack . 
my 2 year old recently was diagnosed allergic to gluten these pb j bars have saved us he loves them and these are his favorite flavor . 
i tried these bars and they were very good , although i do like the peanut butter chocolate chip bars better the bars are a quick and easy to carry snack when you are on the go ! . 
out of all the granola bars that bakery on main makes my 2 year old loves these the most maybe it 's because she can still get the taste of a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich but in a snack bar \) we always have to have a box of this flavor in the house . 
these are good bars for being gluten free not my favorite bar out of everything they carry but still good to keep around for a hunger attack if you really want to try something great try their coconut cashew trubar now , that 's incredible ! it 's like you are being naughty but you 're not ! . 
you just ca n't go wrong with peanut butter and jelly these were so delicious as with the apple cinnamon , i had a hard time keeping my gluten free fearing husband away from these ! yummy ! ! ! . 
one of the best peanut butter bars i 've ever had the fruit jelly is so good and brings the whole thing together in a good snack or dessert . 
of all the flavors i have tried of these bars , the peanut butter and jelly is my favorite ! everyone loves peanut butter and jelly and it is just as delicious as a bar ! . 
this is my favorite granola bar ! being vegan and gluten free is difficult when it comes to finding granola bars that meet my needs this one is absolutely delicious ! i love the ingredients and all the strawberries throughout the whole bar highly recommend ! ! ! . 
my sweet daughter loves these i mean what kid does n't love pb j , and what mom loves not having to make it ! they are sweet , and make you feel like you are not missing out on anything being gluten free highly recommend it ! . 
wonderful ! my son loves these granola bars ! he has celiac and we wanted to try something different , these were a hit ! . 
my girls love these bars ! they are nice for lunches or quick snacks on the go ! good flavor ! gluten free and dairy free is difficult , but bakery on main does it right ! yummy . 
peanut butter and jelly together how can you go wrong \? it is great and without the worries of gluten makes it even better . 
i love these they really taste like a soft pb j sandwich , and you can bring them anywhere ! kids would love them too i hope they 're available again soon because i'm running low ! . 
childhood nostagia all over again ! i love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches , but i do n't often make them because they 're rather messy these bars solve that problem the oats and stuff provide a perfect compliment to the peanut butter and jelly flavor that 's in the bar the best part is that i can eat this on the go and not have to worry about my hands or clothes getting messed up . 
it is cubes for our horses they came in on time and the horses like them there is not much more to say about sugar cubes . 
all my horses love a sweet reward dots hold together nicely in the reward bag . 
the fact that the title of this product includes the number 3000 is misleading i'm not even sure what that number refers to i can tell you that it does not refer to the quantity of gumballs in the package \( which is 850 \) it 's true that the product details stated the actual quantity of 850 , but apparently i glossed over that fact the price is still a good deal compared to other vendors on amazon just not quite as good as i had originally thought shipping took a week longer than expected , but i did receive and apology email the gumballs themselves were well packaged br i would buy from this vendor again \( assuming that the consumption of 850 gumballs does not kill me \) . 
i love this tea it is , hands down , my favorite and the ingredients are very clean and it 's low calorie especially compared to other teas out there this is the real deal it 's basically like making it at home br br it 's so yummy ! light , refreshing i could drink it all day , by the gallon \) . 
my husband and i love this product because it is naturally sweet without the taste of artificial sweeteners most peach flavored teas taste like sugar and artificial flavors but not this drink it is wonderfully watery to quench any thirst i only wish that amazon would always sell it because we would buy it on a regular basis . 
since republic of tea discontinued their bing cherry vanilla tea , i was looking for a replacement the flavor of this tea is very different from republics it 's better the smell is very rich , like toasted vanilla and cherry it almost has a coffee smell , but not quite i do n't like coffee , but this tea is incredible glad i found it best of all , the price ! . 
i really like this tea , but my husband smelled it and commented that it smells like robitussin cough syrup the taste is more subtle than the aroma overall , this tea tastes good and is a good value it 's not the best tasting cherry vanilla or cherry tea i have ever tasted , but i would purchase it again . 
if you can get over the high price , why not enjoy some of the best coffee in the world , right here in the good ol' usa \? br br warning once you get spoiled by this coffee , you might not ever settle for less ! br br bottom line great product , would recommend to a friend . 
i have a bag of this coffee shipped to me every other month i do notice the flavor can vary over time with that said , the worse i 've had was just plain great , and the best roasts are to die for i 've noticed this variation with other coffees too i always assumed it was the minute differences in roasting , and of course the bean itself being a plant , it will hardly have the exact same characteristics of another plant perhaps weather variations count too this last year , the flavor and taste has been more consistent than it was a few years back everyone has different tastes but speaking for myself , this is as close to perfect as it gets . 
tried this because it is 100 kona and much cheaper than the other national brands i have been using what can i say i am greatly surprised mild , no bite too it and no discernable acidity this is on my shopping list from now on . 
this is by far the best kona coffee i 've had i use to purchase trader joes kona coffee but for the last several months they have n't had any and i 've been unable to locate kona any where so i thought i 'd try amazon i saw this and although the price is staggering , the coffee is amazing very smooth with great taste i drink it both hot and cold a pound makes a lot of coffee and while i did n't figure the price per cup , i still think it 's worth it and will purchase it again . 
i have tried a few kona coffees from different vendors , and i can say that this one is a very special coffee i made an order last year and had some issues with one of the two bags i 've bought the coffee lost it 's freshness in the 2nd bag and it was very old , dry and tasteless i was very disappointed by how the same coffee could taste so different in each bag i was n't sure what was the problem , cause the 1st bag tasted very pleasant and aromatic the freshness , texture and delicacy of the coffee took me to nirvana i was very pleased with the organic taste and smoothness of the coffee immediately i knew that this was a very special gourmet coffee br br i 've tried different regional coffees including , papa new guinea , kenya aa , sumatra beans , jamaican blue mountain and others i have to say that kona is my favorite by far the shipping bag comes oxygen free when it 's being shipped from the vendor the air is sucked dry to vacuum seal it sometimes they get damaged or punctured during shipping i guess that 's what happened to one of the bags as you know , coffee and oxygen do n't go well together , cause once the coffee is oxidized it starts losing its freshness and it does n't taste the way it 's supposed to taste br br i 've made a recent purchase again and i'm very happy with the results give this coffee a try before deciding to make a bulk shipment you have got nothing to lose well done hawaii roasters you guys have outdone yourselves . 
my son was on vacation a couple of years ago and brought back hawaii roaster kona coffee they have a different technique the way it is grown then most coffees i thought i would check to see if it was on amazon this is the best tasting coffee i ever tasted well worth the money . 
this coffee has a smoother and milder taste than a dark roasted coffee i like to have this coffee and a dark roasted on alternate mornings the daily contrast in taste keeps me appreciating the delicious coffee favors of each type . 
this coffee , whether brewed in the keurig via eco cup or in a standard coffee pot tasted stale not the award winning coffee that i expected to taste it did n't take me back to hawaii , but instead took me to the folger 's coffee aisle in the grocery store will not order again what a waste of money br br updated 2 3 12 the seller got in touch with me and offered to refund my money he apologized for the coffee not being up to standard the seller has good communication maybe i just got a bad batch who knows thank you ! . 
this coffee was delicious ! i actually purchased it as a gift , but since i paid 30 for 1 lb of coffee , i tasted the freakin coffee ! br br it was so good ! i meant to purchase the light roast , but accidentally ordered the medium it was full bodied and delicious , totally lacking the high acidity that you find with most commercial coffees i ca n't afford 100 pure kona all the time and normally buy blends , but this coffee is the delicious gourmet coffee you need to buy and keep for company or to treat yourself now and then . 
the best thing i like about this sports drink , is it 's not an energy drink low calories \( 15 \) and less caffeine then 8 ounces of coffee br br plethora of natural anti inflammatory ingredients , which mitigates aches and pains and it 's not necessary to take over the counter acetaminophen when you have this br br when i first had some , i felt different not a amp different , rushed just different scared me a bit 3 days later i tried it again the feel different was the pain level going from the constant 8 9 to a 6 \( which is manageable for me \) the feel difference , was me feeling better br br this is giving me the 4 5 year window i need before i have to get my neck and spine fused \( again \) br br at our house now , we have at least 3 cases and this month , it is 4 . 
this jerky is quite pricey for a 6 5 ounce bag , but it 's one of the few i 've found that is salty enough and does n't contain a bunch of sweeteners br br the smoke flavor is also pronounced unfortunately , the price is the only thing that keeps this product from getting 5 stars from me . 
i 've reviewed this before this jerky is fabulous great salt , great snap , great flavor so tasty i want some now . 
these were a wonderful surprise , more delicious than anticipated and guilt free i liked the smaller size pouches easy to carry with me nice to give as a gift the bonus is that they are organic i will be buying more . 
i picked up a package during an airport layover and since i wo n't be back to lax soon decided to check amazon for some more the 4 oz package cost 7 99 at the airport , so you do get a small price break by buying them here in triple packs br wow ! the flavor is amazing i do n't know if the other reviewer got a bad batch or what but mine were crunchy walnuts with the smoothest slightly sweet tasting thick dark chocolate coating one bite and i was hooked br if you are looking for a sweet treat for your sweetie , look no further this should be in every adult easter basket or christmas stocking i have n't raved about a candy like this since see 's dark chocolate covered raspberry cremes ! br br if you like walnuts and dark chocolate , you will absolutely love these the taste is so pleasurable it is hard to describe i just ordered 6 packages , for me and to use as gifts amazon , you need to start selling these so i can use prime shipping ! \( these will fly off the shelf , i promise ! \) br br ingredients organic walnuts , organic ark chocolate coating ooh there is some organic chocolate liquour and soy lethicin in there , that 's why it 's so tasty and smooth contains small amounts of milk , soy wheat and egg and is manufactured in a plant that processes peanuts made in the usa by tropical valley foods br br yes , these will melt in your hand or the hot sun , so be forewarned ! . 
the walnuts and chocolate are very high quality they are rich and decadent it seems strange but when i'm eating just a small piece it tastes like i'm eating a brownie highly recommended . 
the product is great but it arrived mostly melted together instead of individual drop pieces i am sure it was over heated in the shipping we live in central california where temperatures get into the 100s i am able to use them , anyway , by just cutting them up br partly my fault i will try to remember to order during the winter months for cooler weather br excellent product . 
these smell so good i'm tempted to try them myself ! i have to keep real chocolate locked up in my house because my two chocoholic dogs will raid cupboards and chew open drawers to get to it , but they are very happy with these instead i'm so glad i found this safe alternative for them . 
my dogs \( and some other dogs i like to spoil too \) just love these they are their special treats . 
i must say that vitakraft has put life back into my dog he is old and vitakraft offers him more vitamins and minerals than what he was getting from his food now he has more energy and begs for these choco drops . 
i found these at a local pet store and could n't locate them again great price and dogs love them i rec 'd my shipment quickly with no problems . 
i bought this product because my dogs were having accidents in the laundry room overnight i'm not sure how or why this works but it stopped them from peeing the dogs love em too . 
have been buying this product for over a year and 'max' would eat it as fast as i could give it to him however one or two drops at a time for a reward , is his limit ! yogurt is his favorite . 
my dog loves vitakraft dog drops with carob so much , he 'll do any trick possible to have one ! sadly , they 're getting harder and harder to find , so i was thrilled to find them here and the price was great ! . 
a superior dog treat with a chocolate flavor these drops are not toxic to dogs and are vitamin enriched my dogs just love them my grandchildren ate few thinking they were hershey kisses ! ! the children 's mother who is a pharmacist stated that the drops were not toxic to children or dogs ! ! the product is excellent , service from the amazon supplier was excellent but i wish they \( any supplier \) would not use ups as a shipper ups is slower than snail mail ! ! . 
my puppy , megabyte , is a very picky puppy after spending hundreds of dollars on finding treats that she will eat these are one of only two . 
my pug absolutely adores these treats and will do anything for one i can get anything away from her and get her to go anywhere they are a big help for me and a wonderful treat for her . 
my dog loves these treats i can get him to do anything using them they were much cheaper using amazon even with the shipping charges . 
key lime pie is one of my all time favorite desserts when i heard about this gum i was definitely a skeptic , i figured it 'd taste more like just a standard , citrus y mint gum i was wrong ! this definitely tastes like real key lime pie filling actual key lime flavor with a milk sweet taste that 's not too overpowering the flavor actually lasts for quite a while too \( though it 's much more powerful within the first 5 minutes \) try it ! . 
but i 'll give it a shot wow so far i have only tried \( and intend to try \) the key lime pie and the mint chocolate chip but they are both amazing they key lime pie is incredibly tart and delicious but unfortunately the flavor only lasts about 10 seconds the mint chocolate chip is also incredible and the flavor seems to last much longer \( or at least , the dulled post flavor gum is more appealing \) in any event , even for 5 seconds of flavor these gums are a gem great idea by wrigley . 
key lime pie is getting rave reviews throughout my office ! i bought a pack of it to share with my co workers , as well as the mint chocolate chip and strawberry shortcake varieties all have been tasty , but key lime pie has been the star excellent ! ! . 
i just got a pack of the key lime pie gum , and it is some of the best gum i 've had it really tastes like key lime pie , almost eerily so , and is flavorful but not too strong the idea of dessert flavored gum sounds a little like willy wonka , but it tastes really good , and i am looking forward to trying the other flavors . 
never did i think i could put a piece of gum into my mouth and actually experience pie you can seriously taste the crust , the filling , and even the whipped cream on time i do n't know how they did it , but it 's amazing . 
i am addicted to this gum it tastes so close to the real thing and does n't lose flavor compared with the apple pie or strawberry this best flavor of all of this series , along with the mint chocolate chip . 
i like the dessert delights line , and this is one of their better flavors but the carton i received contains only packs that are stale the sticks are stiff and difficult to chew , and the flavor disappears within 10 minutes i'm quite disappointed that they would dump old products on their customers . 
i could n't find the gum at the grocery store so i ordered it from amazon the order came quickly and the gum was great ! . 
thankfully i was able to order quite a supply of this gum my sister and i enjoy this flavor the most and was sad to read it was discontinued i paid a responable price so , i thank you . 
it 's almost eerie how this gum tastes so similar to actual key lime pie i just picked up my first pack today , i this is definitely my new flavor extra really hit the mark here a different , unique , and incredibly delicious gum this scrumptious , delicious treat is sure to please do n't hesitate to buy a pack ! . 
i panicked when i could n't find my extra key lime pie gum in the stores then i thought where can you get just about everything \? amazon of course ! and to my delight , my gum was there ! if you love key lime pie like i do , this is the next best thing to sinking your teeth into a creamy , rich , key lime tart , delicious piece of pie without the calories ! ! ! ! . 
wow , i like the flavors ! i 've tried the apple pie , mint ice cream and the strawberry shortcake \( not too fond of this one \) but the others are great ! i love the apple pie and this key lime pie br br it says hydrogenated starch not oils difference \? . 
this gum is delicious and since my first pack i have been hooked i love the mint chocolate chip after meals , and the key lime pie is delectable at all other times br br at 15 10 pack on amazon , it 's not really a deal , though , considering this is only a 1 a pack at target or mcwallymart once the price of a 10 pack drops to about 10 or 11 i might consider buying it online if only out of pure laziness , but a 50 premium is not really worth it . 
i loved the flavor and the fact that it was so long lasting everyone in the office eats it now we only eat half a stick so we are not sitting around with a big wad of gum in our cheeks , but so far i have not been able to outchew this gum for flavor if you like a bright , citrus y taste that is not too overpowering , you will love this if you like a more minty gum , then go for the mint chocolate chip flavor of this gum . 
i was actually very surprised that this tasted like the real deal it 's very sweet , very limey , and the first couple hundred chews you can taste the crust and a smidge of whip cream after a few minutes , it still has flavor after an hour it still has flavor i love it ! you also get the tangy effect of a lime not as strong but very pleasurable . 
i did not expect this gum to be more than just your typical lime flavored candy type taste but i was floored this gum literally tastes like key lime pie i swear i can even taste a graham cracker crust the flavor only lasts a short time , but it 's an amazing taste ! floored ! . 
this is the absolute best gum flavor ever it really tastes like key lime pie and the flavor lasts a long time yummy ! . 
not being a hard core gum chewer , i was thrilled with this gum a great taste in a gum that last plenty long without any loss of flavor or any kind of after taste a pleasure in my diet routine . 
i 've tried wrigley 's apple pie flavor of their dessert delights chewing gum it tastes exactly like apple pie i ca n't wait to try the key lime pie flavor ! everyone who has posted a review here on amazon says it tastes exactly like key lime pie ! wrigley chewing gum co appears to have hit yet another one out of the ball park ! john v karavitis , john karavitis , karavitis . 
i really like this gum like all of wrigley 's gum products i 've tried , this is absolutely great these dessert delight flavors are truly delightful . 
the extra dessert delights sugargree key lime pie flavored gum is an amazingly limey mouth party it has a zesty tartness tempered with enough sweetness for balance having a piece of gum taste so much like a food is a little disorienting and while i did not really think i would end up looking like a lime \( a la violet beauregard from willy wonka and the chocolate factory movie \) , it was a relief that i did not the only problem is that the flavor does not last as long as bubble gum or mint flavors but that might just be too much to hope for . 
like other reviewers , i had low expectations for this gum , but was happily wrong i love key lime pie , and lime flavor in general when first chewed , this gum has the tangy bite of key lime , with a creamy sweetness , and a hint of graham cracker crust flavor after the initial flavor burst fades , there is that surge of artificial sugary sweetness that occurs with some brands flavors of sugarfree chewing gum , but the surge is n't as overwhelming or long lasting as it is with some sugarfree gums once that fades , the gum has a mellow , subtle , lime zest flavor i really like this gum . 
so far i 've tried all of the flavors and while there are some i'm not over the hill about , i 've had pretty good experiences with them br br this is one of the flavors i 'd purchase again i'm a big fan of anything lemon or lime flavored , so i had to give this a try i 'll admit up front that i have n't had a key lime pie for years , so i do n't remember the flavor like it was yesterday and this probably worked in my flavor \( i remember it in general , though \) br br this tastes awesome i can definitely taste the lime and it tastes like what i remember a key lime pie to be the lime flavor is there , but it 's backed up by a nice creamy taste that almost made me want to grab a few extra slices of gum \( hey , it 's 15 calories a slice so i can splurge on this while i would n't want to splurge with the actual pie \) unfortunately it falls prey to the same problem that the equally yummy apple pie flavor had the flavor does n't last nearly long enough br br i 'll absolutely buy this again , despite the flavor only lasting 1 2 minutes . 
in this age where even basic service no longer exists , i was pleasantly surprised when my transaction actually came off without a hitch shipped on time , and the product was in good condition well done ! . 
i love salt and vinegar potato chips , but ca n't eat them on my low carb diet these pork skins are a wonderful replacement for those high carb snacks the salt and vinegar flavoring in the pork skins is a bit more muted than what i am used to finding in most potato chip brands , but is definitely adequate to soothe my cravings for a crunchy salt and vinegar snack the pork skins are light and fluffy , with almost none of the hard rinds that can be found in some brands of pork skins if the flavoring was a bit more pronounced , i would give this snack five stars . 
if you like salt and vinegar chips but want to avoid carbs then pork rinds are for you especially this brand i 'll eat these instead of chips any day ! . 
would 've rated 5 stars if it had more of a vinegar taste overall , not bad at all , good snack . 
ca n't find them anywhere where i live , so glad i found them here not too salty or vinegary just the right amount thanks . 
the customer service was beyond compare i would gladly do business with this company again . 
i have a hard time finding this up in new england so glad to see this product here this is my favorite product in my spice cabinet i have tried many other so called cajun spice blends and find that they are too salty \( although this is salty too , it is not predominant on the palate \) or too hot \( which a true cajun spice is not hot \) laissez les bon temps rouler ! . 
this is a wonderful product , i was happy to see i could buy it on amazon because our local stores quit carrying it ! we use it mostly to sprinkle over chicken wings to make a cajun wing yummy ! it can be used on almost everything love it ! . 
i , just like all the other reviewers love this seasoning i have been making cajun catfish with this seasoning for about 15 years i have tried other seasonings when this one was not available , but it 's just not the same if you want to try my recipe , it 's very easy i melt butter and brush the catfish fillet with it and generously br coat the fish with the seasoning meanwhile i preheat a cast iron skillet when the skillet is hot i put in about 2 tbs olive oil and than about 3 tbs of butter and fry the fish to a golden to dark brown on each side about 4 5 minutes and add some more butter if the pan becomes to dry after turning the fish during this i make a pot of spaghetti , my wife likes angle hair , after the pasta is done , drain it and remove the fish to a platter , turn off the heat under the skillet , add a little more olive oil and butter , scrape up the bits of fish left on the bottom of the skillet and dump the pasta into the skillet and mix it around to soak up the buttery oil , than sprinkle some more seasoning on the pasta and serve with the fish everyone love it to give this dish a little color , you can add a bag of fresh spinach to the pasta water during the last 2 minutes of cooking , or stir in a small can of diced cajun tomatoes after you put the pasta in the skillet , or use both hope you enjoy it if you try it . 
this is the best cajun spice my wife and i have found anywhere , ever we have been using it for more than ten years it goes great on all sorts of things chicken , beef , pork , fish , eggs \( hard boiled , scrambled , or fried \) , baked potato , etc not only is it a very good combination of spices , it is also ground fine and mixed well whenever we fry something in batter or breading , luzianne 's cajun seasoning usually finds its way into the mix br br we 've tried slap ya momma and other cajun spices , but those tend to be too coarse instead of tasting a blend of spices , you tend to bite down on a nugget of salt , filling your mouth with the taste of salt , then a nugget of pepper , filling your mouth with the taste of pepper , etc luzianne 's is definitely the superior implementation br br we recently ran out of it , and to our dismay safeway has stopped carrying this product , which is why we have tried other brands none have measured up , which is why i was searching for it online we 're very happy to have found it again on amazon . 
i grew up using this seasoning on steak , and pretty much everything could no longer find it in stores so ordered a case off amazon very happy nice spice and flavor highly recommend . 
i love this product and ca n't get it locally anymore it was a fair price and the item was in stock and came quickly i would buy from them again . 
this is a wonderful mix of spices one of my favorite uses is on chicken on the grill try this out br br 5 6 cloves garlic , minced br 1 1 2 tbsp luzianne cajun seasoning br 1 tbsp olive oil br 2 tbsp lemon juice br br combine ingredients with chicken in a gallon size zip lock bag and marinate chicken legs thighs for 2 4 hours br br mix up a second batch , and brush over chicken while grilling , cooking on all sides br br just made this yesterday excellent ! . 
this is the best cajun seasoning ever ! we use it on seafood , steaks and burgers seasoning enhances , not overwhelms , whatever it is put on . 
i have been using luzianne cajun seasonings for years i find it best on beef and fish seafood like one of the other reviewers , i like the fineness and the blend of the seasoning the combination of the two gives it it 's unique flavor br br when i have friends and family over for steaks , they always say these are the best , what 's your secret i first tell them it 's an old family secret , but then i tell them about luzianne i am not sure they are listning , because the next time over we have to go through the same conversation oh well , more praise for me ! br br thanks luzianne for all the pats on the back . 
this seasoning adds just the right amount of spice to almost any dish ! if you want something with a little kick you will love this seasoning ! ca n't beat the price for a top notch product ! . 
oh man , i , like many of us have tried so many cajun seasoning , but this company does it right ! ! br br thank you folks at the heart heat of southern seasoning ! ! br br all my love , br roy watson , br 408 464 0100 . 
i originally discovered this years ago on vacation in southern maryland since then it 's always been in our cupboard we came home to pa that year with three cans of it and then resupplied each summer after a couple of years it became available in our area , but in the last year or so , we have n't been able to find it anywhere this is one seasoning i do n't mind buying by the case \( and it 's a great price , too ! \) br br we put it on virtually anything and i mean anything meats , poultry , seafood , salads , spaghetti , eggs , pot pie , vegetables , soups , whatever it 's especially good on any pasta dish i even sprinkle it on a sandwich the spice is just the right amount of heat with the touch of lemon to top it off it sounds weird but i think i could even enjoy this on ice cream . 
luzianne cajun seasoning is a great way to spice up anything you make it adds a nice amount of heat to your food without being over bearing my whole family loves it ! . 
i have been using this spice mix for many years but , i have found it hard to find lately i decided i would check amazon and i was very surprised to see it available ! i am a fairly good cook and i have developed some easy dishes using this mix and it is very unusual and tasty ! a 12 pack is a lot of this spice but , it does keep for years and i use it quite often give your family the kick it deserves with luzianne cajun seasoning . 
we discovered earth 's best when my oldest started solids years ago they had a more limited selection then , but offered more variety than the regular brands for him , we only bought a few jars each trip , those flavors that we could n't get in another brand for our second child , we added a few more with the 3rd baby , we started out on the larger brands , but he would n't eat them who can blame him ! \? they 're runny and lacking any flavor not to mention , no matter how good sweet potatoes are , how many jars can you eat \? he gobbles up every jar of earth 's best without any problems when we introduce a new flavor , he 's all for it br br i agree with other posts that some of the flavors are very runny we just add a few tsp of cereal and problem solved br br earth 's best is more expensive i calculated that every 2 weeks of food costs me 15 more than buying the other brands however , we decided that since he eats it all \( vs being very picky with other brands \) it 's a wash br br if you want to use earth 's best for your baby w out breaking the bank , try these tips br visit earth 's best 's website and print off all the coupons they 'll allow \( usually 3 \) , have family and friends do the same br br buy at whole foods they have good prices and when you buy a lot , they give you a bulk discount br br you can also buy them by the case at meijers for less than 10 00 , cheaper than here ! . 
according to a lot of reviews on top baby food brands overall , earth 's best was always voted to be in the top 5 of all the lists of reviews by mom links , consumer reports , livestrong , baby health sites here is a excerpt from one of the sites \( i think it was from ehow com \) br br the center for science in the public interest evaluated popular brands of baby foods , including gerbers , heinz , earth 's best and beech nut according to the center 's report , earth 's best did not use starchy fillers or replace real food with water and thickening agents in many of their products for children over six months of age such adulterated products are nutritionally inferior to products made with more fruits and vegetables earth 's best uses certified organic products the brand offers single ingredient , smooth foods for infants over four months fruit , vegetable , grain and meat blends for babies over six months and a variety of chunky soups , dinners and vegetable medleys for children over nine months old earth 's best products are sold at supermarkets , natural food stores and big box stores nationwide br br plus , my baby girl loves it yes , it might be a little runnier than the other baby foods , but i just add a little rice with it and that fixes it . 
we only use jarred baby food as emergency food i make all my little one 's food and freeze it or give it fresh yes , full time working mom but really is it that hard to cook , puree and freeze basic foods like carrots that cost 1 27 for 2 pounds \? i taste all the foods that my baby eats and enjoy the earth 's best line because they taste real it 's not food that you could add to a baby shower game and go what in the world was that \? they use quinoa and kamut flours it is excellent all around br br i believe that the apricot puree that other 's talked about in the sweet potato and chicken dinner is there to maintain the color of the food i make my own sweet potato and chicken dinner for my little one and it turns brown my baby does n't care about the color of the food but i'm sure maybe a mom would freak out if she saw this color in a baby food jar knowing how vibrant sweet potatoes are br br half of the jars in my case were popped up i wrote amazon and at first they offered me not even the cost of the damaged jars i called and they replaced the entire case free of charge this had to have happened at the manufacturing plant and did n't occur during shipping but rather was a sealing issue i was impressed with the speed and efficiency at which amazon handled this will continue to be a loyal customer because of this customer service goes a long ways ! . 
we love the earth 's best line in our house our 9 mo old daughter will only eat earth 's best dinners , and i do n't blame her the smell from both of the other 2 brand was nauseating i 've sampled the earth 's best dinners myself , and they are n't half bad it is baby food the fruit blends and veggie blends are great as well . 
organic foods are probably most important the first couple of years of life that is when so much brain development is happening that trying to keep as much pesticides as possible away from your child 's developing brain and body is a very worthy goal br br fortunately it is a little easier than it is for a grown up with our more varied foods and time constraints and on the go , etc also no matter how worthy a goal , your child has to eat the food this is an excellent combination of flavors that i was not always able to find at local stores and with subscribe and save it is cheaper and delivered to my door br br the flavors are vegetable turkey which lists the ingredients as water , organic carrots , organic apples , organic ground turkey , organic whole barley flour br br sweet potato and chicken water , organic sweet potatoes , organic apricot puree , mechanically separated organic chicken , organic brown rice flour br br summer vegetable water , organic corn , organic zucchini , organic green beans , organic brown rice , organic carrots , organic garbanzo beans , organic canola oil br br rice and lentil water , organic apples , organic carrots , organic brown rice , organic lentils , organic canola oil br br there are other earth best blends where water is not the number one ingredient obviously that somewhat calls into the question the 'value' of this particular earth 's best item i just found the tomato and carrot one which i have ordered but not received yet also if you put in organic baby food in amazon search there are some brands with just food in them for example peter rabbit organics \( have not yet tried it , but might when she is a bit older \) br br overall though i do recommend this variety pack our daughter likes them all and she is getting organic ingredients and for a decent price , even considering the amount of water in them the water being first in all 4 is giving me pause as to the overall value and definitely something i will keep in mind as to trying other brands going forward the ingredient lists are all directly from the earth best 's website , earthsbest com , as i do not have the products in front of my right now . 
my daughter loves these dinners there 's no other organic meat option at my grocery store , so we 're stuck with this one , but i do n't mind at all i think they 're great i agree that they are runny , but you can just thicken it with whole grain cereal , and problem solved \( turkey dinner is thick enough \) i also do n't understand why people complain that they are too sweet , or unhealthy first of all , if you do n't like the ingredients , buy something else second , i trust earth 's best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product third , the belief that if baby tastes sweet food , they will not eat regular food , is an old wife 's tale are you people saying that you do n't give your babies fruit and vegetables \? they are all sweet br the only reason i gave this particular item 4 stars instead of five , is the price i can buy it at my grocery store for 79 cents a jar here , they are being sold for over 91 cents and that 's at the sale price if you buy these at the regular price , it comes to 1 41 way too much ! . 
i 'd continue to buy but i'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars shattered too many they like all the flavors though great textures too . 
i love the thought that these baby foods are organic the shipping is quick , well packaged , and easy to open baby likes all flavors so far of any type of earth 's best baby food however , this brand is always more watery than any other brand i 've tried . 
our primary reason for buying this product is that it came in a variety pack we make most of our own baby food , but we were going on vacation and that was going to be difficult since packing space was limited , we had this shipped to our destination it was the only brand we could find to order in a variety pack the kids liked all the flavors and the consistency seemed good . 
my 6 month old is a fanatic for these flavors ! she gobbles them up and we ca n't load the spoon fast enough for her ! we introduce new foods every 3 days and we always get the interesting blends as well , so she has tried tons of flavor profiles by this point and these really do get a notable reaction from her she goes , mmm , mmm , lol it 's so cute and meats are an easier to absorb source of iron compared to artificially enriched iron that is found in baby cereals i definitely prefer this as a compliment to mommy 's milk as oppose to the cereals that are hard for little tummies to digest . 
i actually cook most of my twins' savory meals , but i always keep a package of these eb dinners on hand for \( 1 \) feeding the girls on the go and \( 2 \) for those times when i just do n't have the energy to cook or defrost whatever is in the freezer the girls like most of the flavors , except for the peas i wish eb had more variety packages with different flavor available . 
my one year old loves this product she eats one every day and never gives me a problem and i trust the ingredients which reassures me that she 's eating something thats good for her . 
i like the variety in this pack nice to not have to pick out individual jars and my baby likes them all ! the only thing i would suggest is if you have a picky eater , maybe buy one jar at a time to test them out before you buy a huge box . 
i purchased this food on amazon then saw it at babies r us for 30 cents less per jar i like the product but amazon is overcharging ! . 
my baby has been eating this brand since he was 6 months i like the convenience of high quality yet not overly pricey jar food like this it is easy on his stomach never had any health issues with it the dinners are a bit more filling than the usual watery vegetable puree but it still does need a little cereal to thicken up summer vegetable is his least favorite the zucchini \( like cucumber \) smells pretty strong he would eat it now but when we first started , he hated it my son loves the other 3 flavors and that 's why i continued with my subscription since it 's more expensive to buy them separately . 
organic foods of course are best for your health and starting your baby on foods that are pure is best no matter what i highly recommend earth 's best products he loves the formula , foods and diapers i love the products because it 's best for my baby i wish i knew about organics and earth 's best 16 years ago with my first baby . 
my baby loves these dinners they are very flavorful and not bland like other baby food that we have tried i love the fact that they are organic and amazon sells them at such a great price . 
my 8 month old son is not the picky eater my first was he had only refused one flavor of all the baby foods introduced to him in 3 months \( and it was peas ca n't blame him for that one \) but he refused to swallow the rice lentil flavor in this variety pack he actually spit it back out and then blew raspberries \( cute , but messy \) i tried several times over 2 weeks and got the same response each time we will not be ordering this pack again even though he loved each of the other meals . 
i used this variety pack to introduce protein into my daughter 's diet she loves all four of the varieties ! . 
this is a nice variety of flavors two are meat based \( chicken and turkey \) and two are vegetable based \( summer veggie and rice lentil \) my 9 month old daughter eats all these flavors and particularly likes the meat flavors i 've had difficulty getting her to eat other meat foods , so i'm happy to have found two meat meals that she loves as with other earth 's best varieties , these varieties include only organic ingredients without any of those funky preservatives . 
great value if you buy it as a subscribe and save item , and i love that it automatically comes to me these are great and they taste really good , making me think that we bought a very high quality product for our child . 
i love earth 's best my son eats almost all of the earth 's best single and combination foods this pack in particular has two of his dinner lunch favorites summer vegetable and brown rice and lentil some of the dinners and a lot of the first purees are very runny so we mix with some cereal to thicken . 
my son loves earth 's best baby food he enjoys his vegetables as much as he does with his fruits he has no problem digesting his food and never spits it up . 
my son really enjoys all these flavors eats them all ! ! ! fast shipping no shopping in stores great prices would recommend to all . 
this is great ! organic baby food options delivered to my doorstep ! the dinners are a good combination and receive a raving review from the bib wearer at the dinner table . 
my little guy loves to try new foods so this variety pack is great br br feeding organic is the way to go we trust and love the earths best brand br ther formula is great amazon com seems to have the best price around i checked br br it is great to get the auto ships of babyfood less trips to the store for dad ! . 
i found this tea when i explored a local grocery store on the north shore of oahu on a trip to hawaii last summer every now then i like to add cream to my tea so the idea of a milk tea was n't totally bizarre \( how you 'd guess i'm american \? \) i enjoy white , black , flavored herbal teas but am not a fan of most floral blends br br i did n't know what to expect when the package said the ingredients included black tea , non dairy creamer , rosehip extract refined sugar i 've never considered putting non dairy creamer into tea would it be a mess i dumped into the mug stirred to death \? instead , i found all the ingredients in an oversized traditional paper tea bag held in a foil like moisture proof package br br after steeping 3mins , i was thrilled to discover a light flavored cup of tea , slightly fruity scented , with a soothing feel to it and no floral tones to the taste and no stirring , no clump at the bottom of the cup br br a year later i found one of the packages in my luggage found it just as tasty easy to prepare as last year i went online to buy some more was thrilled to find that amazon offered the same item a couple of other flavors by the same company too ! . 
these are probably the best crackers i 've ever tasted they came in a christmas gift basket , but i liked them so much that i had to google them to see how to get more this variety contains oregano , poppyseed , and garlic powder because of how thin they are , there 's nowhere for the flavor to hide ! try them with smoked provolone i highly recommend them . 
we love grilling all year long but can not get this in markets the price is great and they ship fast now i can get them year round with no salt . 
since being diagnosed with high blood pressure , this product has been a staple in our home i especially enjoy the grilling blends for the price i got it for online it was a great deak , usually much more expensive in store , so buying in bulk from amazon is the way to go . 
100 ground arabica beans not my favorite , but not bad for a light medium brew smells wonderful as it 's flowing out of the kaldi machine smooth and not bitter , slight floral \( \? \) aftertaste . 
i purchased some of this special habanero sauce this past year for my super bowl party it was a hit ! i thought i would try the mild since i like some zing , but did n't want to burn my mouth off it was a great mix of some spicy zing with a sweet overtone went great with chips as a dip , as well as really good with as a dipping sauce with chicken wings br br i am thinking about using this as a glaze as well for an upcoming pork tenderloin i think this sauce is a great change of pace from the person who is sick of the same tastes that you get from the same stuff in the local grocery stores plus it is from a small business win win win ! br br thanks again everidae sauce for a great change of pace ! . 
mild everidae sauce is like a condiment it goes on everything and does n't take over the flavor of the food but enhances it i use this sauce on burgers , shredded pork , grilled chicken , baked chicken , eggs , as a pizza sauce substitute , and basically anything my kids love the mild kick and flavorful enhancement of the mild sauce my 10 and 6 year old put it on everything and rave ! it will change your cooking and challenge you to try it on everything ! . 
so i have sampled and bought my fair share of everidae sauce and i have to say without a doubt it is the next best thing to put on food i will start off by saying i do know the maker of this sauce , and although that may seem like this review is a bit biased , i wanted to be the first to formally state the flavorful blend of this sauce can literally go on everything br br i like spicy hotness , and unlike other condiments like franks red hot , this does n't mask the flavor of the food but adds to it br i have used this sauce on hotdogs , hamburgers , chicken , tacos , and eggs br br the mild is a little bit sweeter than the medium and hot \( the hot being the heat that i particularly enjoy \) but this stuff can be added to almost any sauce or family recipe to give it that extra kick of spicy sweetness that will make your mouth water . 
i have been a huge fan of jelly bellys since i was a kid , which was about 25 years ago i have always had a favorite at first it was peach , then banana juicy pear came along and that was my favorite for about ten years i thought nothing would top it , ever then i tried red apple it is sweet and tart and really delicious , my new favorite flavor a ten pound box is surprisingly tempting and i am sorry they are currently all sold out . 
i was n't sure what to expect from this jelly belly flavor i have eaten red apples before but they were usually in a fruit this was a candied bean with red apple flavors put inside despite the obvious witchcrafts , i tried this confection because i am not afraid of the unknown like so many people in the religious right \( wrong \) i was surprised to find that this red apple had a delicious apple like flavor and a chew not unlike a finely prepared hamsteak would i eat more of these \? yes , i would i would also recommend this red apple to anybody who is adventurous and wants to experience a new and exciting way to feel the best parts of the fruit eating process red apple jelly beans , they do taste like apples kind of but not completely still pretty good . 
this jelly tastes heavenly you wont find anything this good at the grocery store all i can say is i 'll be ordering more shortly . 
latest update br br we are now past the baby food stage so i may have missed this if it was formally announced , but i recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely bpa free i confirmed this with customer service leaving the remaining review as it was br br br br my wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months then , when our daughter was going to begin daycare , there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought earth 's best it was organic , and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself the variety packs are a nice , easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy and enjoy she did for several of the flavors , though some she hated as well all in all , we were pleased , and baby seemed pleased br br needless to say , i was pretty surprised to read the review about bpa in the lids i spent some time trying to verify this myself a lot of different blogs stated it , and while i could n't find anything definitive , here 's what bothered me clearly earth 's best knows people are concerned about bpa in their lids their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question the admin answers these the same way food safety and baby health is of the highest priority , call us to discuss that 's only slightly paraphrased going to their website , they have zero articles on bpa and none in the faqs section either nothing i'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased , but i would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents something hey , we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of bpa found in our food is x , which is so low , there are no health concerns just say something anything do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product \? br br as i was taking the time to review their product , i decided i would call them to give them a fair chance to explain something , i likely would n't have done if i was n't writing a review their office was closed 9am 7pm est not the most convenient times for a working parent , but i will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly br br updated \( old \) br just spoke to someone from customer service she says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is bpa free , but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner , that does contain bpa , but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food i'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer , but i'm ok with it i still think it should be an answer that 's readily available to consumers without calling them , but i will say there was no hold time at least . 
here is the response i got to my emailed question about bpa in the lids of their glass jars br br while all of our earth 's best foods were and are safe earth 's best organic jarred baby food was converted to packaging that does not use bpa in october , 2011 br br that satisfies my concerns they include a 1 800 number if people have further questions please feel free to contact us at 1 800 434 4246 , monday through friday from 7am 5pm mountain time br br i do n't know why they do n't advertise this on the packaging , website , etc it would reassure a lot of parents ! . 
i have been very pleased with this variety pack of baby food the pack contains three each of pears , peaches oatmeal banana , apples and apricots , and peaches bananas and raspberries my 6 1 2 month old daughter loves all of them , especially the peaches bananas and raspberries ! i have been very satisfied with earth 's best with one exception the metal lids have a lining that contains bpa \( as do all lids on glass babyfood jars \) , so if you 're set on staying away from bpa , you 'll want to get your baby food from companies that make pouches , like happybaby and plum organics i make a lot of my own babyfood , so i feel that feeding her some food from glass jars is acceptable , especially for varieties that i ca n't make i do also buy a lot of happybaby , and i'm very satisfied with the quality there also all in all though , a very nice variety of good tasting fruits ! . 
awesome baby food , i bought it online to save a few bucks , but some of the jars were broken when they arrived 5 stars for the food , 1 star for packing and shipping quality . 
my little guy ate this all up before i could even write a review ! \) . 
earth 's best baby food br my favorite brand of baby food by far both my son \( who is now over 2 years old \) and my daughter \( now almost one \) have used a wide variety of foods from earth 's best i am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth but i do not feel that all organic brands are equal i 've tried many varieties \( including store brands and others only available through internet purchase \) and found that earth 's best is by far the best for your money br br fruit variety pack br normally i would say this is a great idea , but i was n't a fan of this particular variety my son would have been just fine with it , but unfortunately for us at this point my daughter is allergic to raspberries and mangos these are both things i think she 'll grown out of , but something you may want to consider when purchasing this item i would suggest trying an individual serving of one from your local store to see if your child has an allergy , but if they do n't i would say buy it ! other than that i do think it 's a great variety for kids who need some changing up occasionally also , the subscription price on this variety is great and can be altered depending on how soon you need it we ended up running through another subscription we had and were able to have another shipped as soon as we needed it . 
i love earth 's best products that 's the only product i use for my baby ! my baby loves it and i never had any problem with it it organic which makes it all that much better ! . 
i 'd continue to buy but i'm moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars shattered too many they like all the flavors though great textures too . 
i love these foods my first son devoured them happily and now my second son also loves them this fruit mix has a great variety my sons both love the peach oatmeal banana best overall a great product high quality ingredients and they do n't taste half bad , i of course had to try them if my boys loved them . 
my 8 month old loves these he hardly swallows one bite before he 's already opened his mouth for the next bite i make my own baby food when i have time , but when i do n't , this is a great alternative . 
this was a good buy the variety is still close enough so i did n't have to worry if baby will like the next one . 
i am a strong believer in giving my baby organic foods as much as possible we used many of the earth 's best flavors and baby really enjoyed most of them what i found irritating though was how runny many of the flavors were i often had to add oatmeal or rice just to keep the food on the spoon water is added to many if not most of the flavors i wondered if that was a necessity however plum ella 's kitchen and happy baby brands \( also organic \) do not have water as an added ingredient we definitely used these , but to be honest , i prefered the other brands because i felt we were getting a better value considering we were n't paying for water in those packages . 
i'm not the one who eats these so i ca n't give the best review but my son gobbles them up so i 'll take that as a 5 star rating from him and i give it 5 stars since i know it 's organic and i do n't have to worry about what he 's eating now if i were to review his vegetables i might have to deduct a star for him but that 's just because he does n't seem to care for peas much . 
with the amazon mom discount , this is cheaper than in stores unless there 's a sale it regularly goes on sale at kroger , publix , and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar i wish there were other earth 's best fruit varieties available on amazon at this price no problems with breakage during shipping for me , but i found the packaging annoying in general though , i think earth 's best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you 're getting organic , non gmo baby food delivered to your door step ! as a single mom in a rural community , going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle br br earth 's best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non organic foods like gerber the textures are good , but i had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd foods made my son gag i had a similar issue graduating from 2nd foods to 3rd foods sprout baby food , however , is the best quality i 've tried for freshness , aroma , and taste it reminds me of pureed fresh produce while i 've seen it in winn dixie for the same price as earth 's best , it 's much more expensive on amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online i'm going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it , but i 'll probably always keep a few jars of earth 's best to get by in a pinch . 
i love getting this case it actually saved me money by buying it this way and my son loved the fruit varieties i felt good about giving him this , because it is organic the price is also good for the product . 
i bought this for my 8 month old grandson to try he loves it ! i'm so pleased that i am ordering it for my infant great niece and also for part of an all organic baby shower gift this food is inexpensive , convenient , and organic best of all he likes it ! i'm setting up the recurring delivery method for my grandson br correction ! the product i ordered two weeks ago was 7 76 a case now the cost is 11 03 that 's quite a price hike is there any way to be notified if the price goes back down \? . 
we just started using these and my 7 month old daughter really likes them i 've tried a couple of bites and they are tasty with good flavor combinations i love that they are organic my only complaint not specifically related to the product is that when i got mine in the mail , one of the jars was broken and i had to clean the food off of the other bottles . 
my one year old loves this product she eats one every day and never gives me a problem and i trust the ingredients which reassures me that she 's eating something thats good for her . 
i have a habit of trying everything myself before offering it to my lo with this product i am sure that i am providing my lo with good nutrition and good taste br he simply loves it . 
it 's gift for my princess it tastes good and baby love it packaging is also very carefully so they arrived home safely . 
our baby loves loves this food we actually mix a jar with 1 2 scoops of rice cereal for breakfast and he gobbles it up earths best is the best ! . 
great variety of fruits , and my 8 month old loved them all we bought this assortment pack as well as the vegetable one and it lasted well over two weeks . 
my son can not get enough of these fruit purees i can not think of a higher standard of praise for this product ! . 
i was very pleased with the price of this product and the shipping speed was fast ! i like that i did n't have to lug this back from the grocery store thanks , amazon ! . 
the bananas are a little runnier than most brands , but overall , my son loves this stuff and what a great price ! . 
liked the baby food \( yes for myself p \) really tasty and smooth consistency for an organic treat , except the peaches and apricots not soo much nice flavor and such really good though and timely shipping excellent buyer ! ! . 
my baby loves earth 's best product the food is tasty and does n't cause her constipation problem i'm happy that i can find the organic and affordable food for my baby . 
we make our own fruits and veggies to use at home or at daycare however , storing them while we travel is challenging so we use the earths best on trips the flavor is wonderful , the ingredients are simple and organic and we feel good giving this to our 7 month old she loved all of the flavors in this variety pack so much that we are trying to replicate them at home we also keep these in the pantry as back up . 
i am loving earth 's best brand overall i set out with the goal of making all of our son 's food however , when i returned to work full time the puree time was less so my go to backup is earth 's best baby food we 're on stage two now , almost stage 3 , and he loves them i appreciate the no added sugars preservatives and that it 's mostly organic he loves the taste and combos good stuff , great product , love it ! . 
the flavor combinations are good and taste pretty good too i did not give it 5 stars because i thought the consistency of the pears was a bit thin and runny for stage 2 that is easily solved if you mix the fruit with some cereal my little girl loves them . 
great value if you buy it as a subscribe and save item , and i love that it automatically comes to me these are great and they taste really good , making me think that we bought a very high quality product for our child . 
we love earth 's best its hard to beat their variety of flavors and organic offerings you can also buy a vegetable variety pack , gourmet meals , or my favorite , the seasonal ! good price on amazon too , especially if you do subscribe and save ! ! . 
i like this one better than all the other ones by earths best the variety is good and my son seems to enjoy them all br br if i am going away for a weekend this is perfect for feedings it is packaged well and again the variety helps ! . 
the variety pack is the way to go when buying in bulk my 9 month old daughter loves all of the flavors . 
i bought this for my 1 year old and he loves it just as much as the other organic brands we 've purchased , but i got this one for 30 50 less ! great buy . 
my son happily eats all of the fruit veggie varieties of earth 's best , unlike the organic baby products , none of which he likes at all br br be careful to only get the fruit and veggie variety packs , not the dinner packs , as they have meat in them . 
i was reading the other day about which items you shoud buy organic br and fruits and vegtables were the top of the list so dahh it dawns br on me what have i been feeding my baby \? we changed to earths best br i feel better , feeding the best br also we use earths best formula when we changed our baby now sleeps br thru the night and that realy makes me happy ! . 
we are huge fans of earth 's best my daughter loves them it 's a great variety i would definitely reccomend this .

coriander is a spice many people pass up or simply overlook and very rarely use except when they might make a corned beef brisket every so often sometimes you will find a bit of it in popular seasoning blends as well but it 's usually a task to find just a small bottle of reasonably priced coriander in grocery stores which deters folks even more from experimenting with this terrifically tasty and fragrant spice the frontier coriander powder is wonderfully citrusy and robust , full , very rounded and well balanced and very palatable , mouth watering flavor with hints of lemon , not extremely overpowering of all of your other flavors in whatever your making either , which is very nice because this allows you to use it liberally if wanted it goes good on meats and vegetables and also smells great when you throw a handful in the bbq smoker and let the coriander smoke do its job on the meat and veggies on the bbq the frontier coriander powder is of exceptional value and quality , if you like coriander and think you 'd like to start experimenting with it in your recipes i 'd recommend buying some and re discover the world of delicious coriander . 
coriander is my favorite spice after cumin and i go through loads of it i put it in practically everything i cook the only problem is it 's so freaking expensive if you buy it in a grocery store you need to pay 5 bucks for a dinky little container ! so i shopped around a bit online until i found this and it 's the best deal i could come up with br br i mean , two whole pounds of coriander for under 12 bucks ! \? it sounds too good to be true however , the price was too low to resist and i figured that even if it was poor quality , i could just use a double or triple amount , because two pounds br br anyways , the coriander itself comes in two 1 pound metallic bags so far i 've only opened one and the other is chilling in my freezer the coriander is fragrant and flavorful , even better than i expected the only danger is that i might overspice as i eagerly throw handfuls of the stuff into everything i make why \? because i have two pounds ! if i ever run out i will definitely consider buying this again br br the only real con is that there is so much coriander that it might take too long to use and lose flavor over time i honestly do n't think that will be a problem for me considering how much i use , but it might be smart to split the order among multiple people for this price , you really ca n't go wrong . 
after coming back from living in england for several months , i craved me some coriander \( carrot coriander soup , coriander spiced omelettes \) but even in the bay area , this spice been surprisingly hard to find , especially at a decent price ! br br buying it in bulk from this seller , the price is unbeatable , and the quality seems comparable to the name brand , top notch stuff in england one thing to note is that the coriander comes in metallic pouches \( not resealable \) , so if you want to keep it in a resealable bag container , you 'll have to provide your own br br also , i wish i had found someone to split this with me , since it seems like even 1 bag will last me forever ! . 
unless you can use it all , plan on sharing great ingredient for my southwest spice mix recipes , and any dish you might want to spice up . 
the quality of these spices is excellent and rather than buying smaller amounts at huge comparative cost and inferior in quality at a supermarket , this is really the way to go ! i store unopened packages in the freezer for freshness along with cardamom , this is a spice i use daily so i appreciate the deal here . 
happy with this purchase , it 's a good deal it 's the most fragrant coriander ever ! coriander is a super spice , tri dosha \( and a health supplement as well , research it , it 's a ground cilantro seed \) we use it in lots of dishes br thank you ! . 
this is the best tasting brown rice i have ever had kind of a nutty flavor this is the only rice i have ever had that tastes great all by itself . 
i love basmati rice and to get the organic is the best this product is great tasting and the aroma was amazing ! the only reason that i wo n't purchase it again is the amount in the package is very little and for as much as i steam rice \( for not only my kids and me but our french bulldogs \) it is just not enough for the price you have to pay way too expensive so , i go to vitamin cottage and get the ludenburg organic brown basmati rice in a 2 lb bag for 4 45 great deal and great product ! . 
this product is very good i have really been pleased as usual of amazon , it arrived in good timely fashion thank you . 
i just picked this up at my local grocery store because it was the only organic brown rice they had and i was pleasantly surprised ! it cooks really well , not sticky at all \( i use a bit of coconut oil and cook it in organic vegetable broth \) tastes great ! i am not typically a brown rice lover but this kind was really good my kids and husband ate it and asked for seconds as well was delighted to see it on amazon and for such a great price with subscribe and save ! . 
it is great thin and tasty brown rice just follow the recipe on the packet and it cooks perfect thank you . 
here is a great way to get that tast of your childhood without all the sugar br even without blood sugar problems i want to cut back on any excess sugar br this allows you to have a drink option \( other than water \) with a perky taste that br is low calorie and sugar free br br parents dont tell the kids and just serve it , they will never know the diffrence br its that good . 
my entire family and my extended family \( cousins \) love the entire product flavor line why have they taken this product out of the stores \? several large food store chains have taken the products off their shelves why \? . 
we absolutely love the sugar free cherry kool aid but have a very hard time finding it in stores br when we discovered it on line we bought a bunch it is a wonderful product ! hope they keep making it ! br delicious ! . 
i was going through about 2 litres per day of various soda drinks switching to this has really brought down my caloric intake and i have dropped about 5kg with this being the only change in my diet . 
i 've been searching for alternatives for high calorie high sugar drinks after tasting many different products , this one is my favorite by a long shot i ca n't believe it has no sugar at all the little packets make a nice quantity of the beverage some of the other brands i have tried gave me heartburn or they were n't sweet enough this one is perfect i tried the cherry flavor also which is good , but not as good as the tropical you have to be careful with spilling it because it does tend to stain , but any traditional stain remover did just fine at preventing the stains from setting in to carpet , clothes , and countertops br br ditch the sugary alternatives and you can save hundereds of calories per day just by using this instead cutting calories just became a lot more easy ! br br edit i still use this product multiple times a day it 's great to have a premixed drink in the fridge that you can go to that tastes great , and you do n't have to worry about calorie intake , or getting the kids all hyped up from sugars i also took 2 packets on vacation and mixed it on site saved time and money instead of stocking a fridge up when you would just have to throw away the unused portion at the end of the trip i just wish they made a orange and maybe a berry flavor as well . 
i cant keep enough of this in my house my kids drink it like its going out of style i love it cause its so easy to make just water and the packet the best part is that is sugar free . 
the tropical punch flavor tastes just like i remember as a kid easy to use , and fully dissolves in cold water \( although i 'll use a chopstick or knife to stir the mix while the water is filling \) . 
i love this kool aid mix and they stopped selling it at my local albertsons \( boooooooooooo \) luckily i found it here and it is even cheaper than it was in store ! ! . 
was looking for a way to bulk purchase sugar free kool aid this fit the bill and then some i am trying to cut back on soda for the family , so this was an excellent way to do it cheaper than the store \( although not by much \) and always available \( something the local grocery store could try \) this was my second set of these and they are just as fast and just as good as the first oh and the sugar free part , ca n't tell the difference , great product ! . 
i chose to purchase in quantity as it is cheaper than the grocery store i liked the product so i knew what i was getting . 
i am glad to be able to get one of my favorite drinks again for some reason a few years ago all of the stores in my area stopped carrying the sugar free koolaid i like the new pouches that are in the tubes rather than the old tubs that were stacked , they are easy open and pour nicely into the bottom of the pitcher there is less of the particles stirred up into the air from the pouches , as they stream the powder out rather than it just dumping in a blob from the tubs . 
great basic hydration for summer satisfied with the amount of sweetness i mix with water and ice cubes for instant satisfaction . 
i have been having blood sugar and yeast issues , and i 've had to cut out sugar i had never tried sugar free kool aid before , so i was a bit nervous about this one luckily i found the taste to be really good even my picky kids love it ! br br i love the fact that these come pre sweetened in individual pouches you just tear one open and stir it into 2 quarts of water it could n't be faster or easier ! it even dissolves well in cold water br br i just ordered a case of the cherry flavor , too my kids and i ca n't get enough of the tropical punch flavor , so we 're excited to try cherry , too . 
my local harris teeter stopped carrying and said they could not get this product any more so happy to find it on amazon com ! ! . 
this reminds me of summertime in my childhood when my mother would bring a ice tinkling pitcher of kool aid out to the backyard , and serve it to us while we sat splashing in the wading pool ! so , i was very pleased that amazon offers this , since it is getting harder and harder to find in the seattle area i do most of my grocery shopping on line at safeway , and they do n't offer it or any suger free kool aid flavors i think the price is a little high , but i ordered it on sale and also subscribed to have it delivered bi monthly , so the price is more reasonable i also purchased the grape flavor , but tropical punch is still my favorite next time i will get the cherry flavor , because i like it mixed with crystal lite lemonade ! it disolves very well in cold water , and to me does not taste sugar free at all and of course it is even more refreshing and delicious served up in my vintage 1960 's kool aid pitcher and little kool aid cup ! ! ! . 
i'm so glad i found this seller i just purchased my keurig about a week ago and wanted to try some different flavors without committing to an entire box it was fun picking out all the flavors i wanted to try if you go over to her website , , there is a much easier to read list of flavors and types of coffee that she has in stock after purchasing , i immediately sent an email to the seller with my flavor requests i received an email response shortly after and everything was packed and ready to go less than three hours later ! how 's that for customer service \? and the shipping was lightning fast ! i just received my package today \( monday \) after ordering thursday night all cups are accounted for and i'm already enjoying one of the cups i received if you are new to keurig , or want to experiment with some new flavors , this is a wonderful way to pick exactly the ones you want ! . 
i have two indoor small dogs , poodle and maltese , and they have high anxiety , especially my maltese and these seem to help ! even if it doesnt they sure love 'em my maltese before he ate it set it down and rolled all over it , i think he likes it ! i 'd give it 5 stars but its just a little pricey . 
this product is very flavorful and you do n't need much of it in your recipe it 's really strong , it 's organic . 
i used this in making a wedding cake for some friends it tasted awesome mixed into the fodant ! i would purchase other flavorings from this vendor . 
arrived on time , smells like a good addition to my baking supplies came in excellent condition will use in syrups , etc . 
we have been looking for pesto that tastes as good as what we had in tuscany this is from the same region as our favorite the consistency is just a bit runny it has moderate chunks of garlic it was quite tasty ! . 
this hit my sweet cravings perfectly definitely keeping this around yum i would definitely reccomend this to anyone wanting a quick snack that is n't a lot of calories get the 94 fat free and it 's only 100 calories . 
i really liked this popcorn , and the price is much better than purchasing at a regular supermarket if you have at least a 1 , 000 watt microwave , it is best to use power level 7 \( 70 \) to start with , and set a timer for one minute until you arrive at the best power level and time for your particular microwave otherwise , smoke or worse may lead you to believe this is a bad product . 
this popcorn is great , and even comes in smart pop at lower calories i always have both for the me and the grandkids . 
i know the price varies for stage 1 foods but sometimes they are a lot cheaper on amazon then in the stores i was n't sure how many were in the package so i decided to just buy one there are 8 packs of 2 in this package so for the price , you are getting 16 containers i personally was n't sure if i was getting a great price or paying slightly more then if i went to the supermarket i like these gerber containers of baby food it 's easier to get the food out , they do make some organic varieties , and you seem to get almost double the amount of food for the same price as jars if you only use half the lid snaps back on easy like a desposible food container . 
these prunes saved so many of my baby 's uncomfortable constipation days when he started on solids the puree seems to be easier to consume than prune juice and we used to give it to our baby with yogurt it soon became his favorite food and eased his symptoms i highly recommend this product to parents who are having a hard time with their babies' constipation . 
our pediatrician recommended we feed our constipated 6 month old prunes he was n't too thrilled with the taste but it did the job p . 
i think bjs has a better deal on mixed fruit packs by gerber , but if your child really loves peaches , this is great ! . 
these are really awesome the flavor is unexpected , but perfect gives a boost to plain old pork rinds lots more crunch with way less the calories of salt vinegar chips ! ! ! in addition , the company is quite pleasant to deal with , and all the other products i 've tried are delicious and a good bargain , too . 
i found out about this spice blend in dallas a few years back when i persuaded a waitress to tell me what the restaurant was using on the grilled shrimp br br i like this cajun spice for grilling fish recommend , but store it in a dry place and replace it every year or so at least , or it will lose its flavor . 
we love this seasoning easy , fast and great on chicken , fish , pork , etc just melt a stick of butter and stir in this seasoning until it becomes a loose paste brush on protein , and sear on a hot pan cast iron is best always skin side down when dark , place in a 400 oven until cooked to correct temp enjoy ! . 
i ordered these gummi bears after first trying them at yogurtland i was a little weary about ordering them because of the last two reviews but i received a perfectly packaged item they were not melted and did n't have a powdery texture to any of the gummi bears they are my husband 's favorite ! we have been enjoying them since we received them and i 'll be ordering more for events that are coming up . 
these baby gummy bears are by far the best i 've ever had i had first purchased the 1 5 lb bag here , on amazon , but i realized as soon as it arrived that it was n't going to be enough however 5 lbs on a subscription basis \? oh yeah . 
i bought these to add to my easter favors i love the colors for that reason basic and pastel all of which are different flavors i did n't eat any myself but my friends who received the favors loved them ! i have a prime account so the gummies shipped very quickly so there was no melting going on \( other reviews mentioned this \) ca n't complain about the price for a 5 pound bag it was a great deal and if i needed buy gummies in bulk again i would definitely buy these mini bears . 
my boyfriend tried these gummy bears at our favorite frozen yogurt place and said they were the best gummy bears ever i sued them to tell me what kind they were and found them on amazon then bought a 5 lb bag of them for him haha he wanted to go get frozen yogurt every other day just for the gummy bears anyway , they are really flavorful gummy bears ! . 
these bear cubs are great ! they 're just like the kind you can get at novelty candy stores only much cheaper than their 8 9 lb in my opinion , the flavors of albanese gummy bears are much better than haribo 's bears i have n't experienced any powdery residue or a melted goop as previous reviewers had my bears came to me in perfect condition and perfect packaging if you like mini gummy bears , i suggest you give these a try . 
these are the best gummie bears i have evvvveeerr had we sell them where i work so i had to get my hands on some the flavors are so vibrant and just pop in your mouth . 
i have 3 chihuahuas and i thought these would be better for them since they are smaller than a full ear they still were too much for the little guys i would say a dog 20 30 pounds should be able to handle them better than my 8lb guys br they had a strange smell and felt slightly oily to the touch i do n't know if that was something added to them to preserve them or it was natural br my chihuahuas are fussy and they liked them i was just worried about blockages since they seemed to swallow large chunks of them they did n't have any problems and my 4lb was able to handle them i just would n't buy them again since my guys are too small the bags were a good size for the price i bought three and should have bought one bag br i rated them 4 stars since they were of good quality just better for larger dogs in my opinion . 
when we lived in ca we found this packaged brownie mix at our local chi chi grocery store on am impulse we purchased them and made them that night amazingly good made with a cube of butter so be warned ! yummmy ! we went back and bought all the packages on the shelf and had the owners reorder many times for us we have since moved to another state and have been trying to hunt these down what a pleasure to find them on our old haunt amazon order , order , order so they will stay available here ! . 
how can you not like this at what great price they sold it at \? i also split it up and sent some to my daughter it is one of my favorite cooking spices along with oregano , but i tend to make alot of stews and soups one must have spice is thyme of course the oregano is for tomato sauce along with basil this was a deal . 
i dont take it to lose weight , this is a laxative tea , as all the ones labeled weight loss tea i'm very constipated and taking this tea everyday has helped me very much , with no cramps or other negative effects it 's strong and dont recommend it for ocassional constipation or for losing weight warning when it works you have to go . 
fennel tea is the best herbal tea i have been able to find and seelect is the best tasting brand of those i have tried . 
i actually , gasp , tried this stew i got to try this at the texas scottish festival in arlington earlier this year at the caladonian kitchen booth \( then bought a few cans \) the stew was quite good considering it comes from a can probably a fairer star rating would be 5 stars , if comparing just against other canned stews i'm not entirely fair though , because i'm comparing it against stews i 've had at irish restuarants so , i have had better but , still a good product in it 's own right i also liked the whiskey cake from the same company . 
my 2 cats really like this cat food best of all ! i have regular deliveries in order to be sure to have an ample amount available . 
this is the only flavor my cat will eat she goes br crazy over this flavor i think because it is easy br to eat instead of a big chunk this looks like little br square slices of beef it smells good too whenever br i open a can of this , she comes running ! she 's meowing br at me repeatedly if she sees the can in my hand , and i br imagine that she is saying hey , hurry up and open that br can ! i know what you got there you ca n't fool me br gimme that yummy food ! but of course , she 's saying br that in cat language because i love her , i can totally br understand what she 's saying what cat lover does n't \? br we definitely have that connection with our cats , do n't br we \? to her , tender slices is the ultimate gourmet meal . 
this product is positively wonderful ! use it anywhere you might use ordinary balsamic , but use it sparingly as it packs a very fruity punch apply just a bit to some fresh berries and pour it over vanilla ice cream for a fantastic desert treat . 
i had these on the airline and was so excited to not have the juice ! i spent a month in italy and bought the olives w out juice but they seem to be hard to find in the usa these are great since there is no juice ! you can take them anywhere and not worry about the mess i have been super happy with these the flavor is pretty bold so i only eat 1 2 packs a week i am going to try another flavor i definitely recommend trying them ! i love olives and this is a great idea . 
although i like olives , often i only want 3 or 4 due to their intense flavor these olives have a great flavor that keeps you coming back for more i love to snack on them at work and have no problem finishing the whole package each time . 
these olives are delicious ! they are not overwhelmingly spicy my 8 year old son just ate an entire bag today for a snack they are not packed in juice but are moist and flavorful the bags are small enough that they are perfect for tossing in a lunch box or bag the calories listed for consuming the entire bag is only 100 . 
olives are yummy and a good diet snack , but i just ca n't quite give this 5 stars why \? br br because first of all , the flavor is occasionally too overly strong with some of the packs i 've picked up i love the taste of chili powder mixed with olives , but sometimes the flavor just is n't as consistent from pack to pack i'm fine with some changes in taste , but some packs have it packed on while others have been fairly weak this is n't enough to keep me away from this flavor , but it can be aggravating br br the only other issue i have is that i wish that this was resealable i do n't often eat all of these in one sitting and i do n't really like having to bring a second bag with me in order to seal up the portion i do n't eat it would be nice if the bag was resealable via a ziplock top or a small piece of adhesive fixed to the bag i did n't deduct a star for this , but it 's something i 'd like to see br br otherwise this is a great product the olives are always freshly kept in the bag and are of a good size there 's no puny little olives here , which i like because it 's easy to get full when i eat these as a snack . 
the smell alone will make you salivate , it is that good it comes with rock sugar mixed in , so i do n't ever use any added sweeteners . 
i needed something that would last a long time my dog cannot stop chewing , she has to have something in her mouth she eats anything that she can get in her mouth rock , plants , wood chips , walnuts , apples , grasses these work really good i'm order somemore on line here , petsmart quit caring them i also found out that pork in better for your dog instead of beef bone or anything with beef . 
it 's difficult to find 20 words to say about mauna loa macadamia nuts , milk chocolate toffee , other than delicious they did n't last long i'm not sure if that 's a good thing or a bad thing . 
first , yuban is my favorite coffee to be able to buy a case and save is great the coffee was in date , the seals on the cans were excellent , and the freshness of the coffee was excellent i will definitely buy more yuban coffee when i need it from amazon groceries . 
i got a case of yuban cans from amazon for an amazing price and now that i 've been reintroduced to yuban i'm sticking with it it 's colombian which is the coffee i prefer anyway but yuban must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you do n't need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal sniffing this coffee as i scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight ! ! just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly buying the case is very convenient too ! ! ! ! . 
this is the coffee we crave in our house it is a strong brew , yet not bitter yuban is the best ground coffee we have tasted , yet . 
and a great price from amazon my wife and i had dinner last night at a very high end restaurant and while everything was magnificent we both thought the coffee was n't as good as our yuban i often wonder about starbucks whose coffee i find undrinkable my son says it 's an acquired taste . 
while working as a busboy in a high end resturant in the 1960 's the resturant ran low on coffee the manager sent me out to purchase yuban and only yuban saying it was the best ! i have been drinking yuban for nearly 50 years and have always found it to be an exceptionally rich , smoothe columbian coffee there can only be one ! yuban ! . 
great price , the best maxwell house makes it is a very good coffee for the price , less then 3 50 a can . 
i love the taste of this coffee it does not have a bitter taste and the size of the can , which per ounce is the same as if you bought the large can , keeps it fresher as a smaller amount is exposed to the air . 
my dad has been a yuban fan for as long as i can remember the stronger the better ! when you break the spoons stirring it , it 's just right ! he even goes so far as to plan his shopping and the stops on the trips that he takes , at stores that serve yuban coffee why , i do n't know , i'm a sweet tea ice no lemon guy so i have no opinion on coffee , yuban or not , one way or another i can say that it smells good brewing but then so does play doh and some of the old magic markers i'm just trying to report about what i 've been exposed to br here i buy the packs of 12 , every 6 months for him and give them to him at christmas and father 's day they stay fresh and save the public from being exposed to the mad , half clothed emergency trips to the store that my 70 year widower father makes to score the base component for his and the house guest of the moment 's \( see 1 below \) daily ritual sunrise aperitifs we 've asked about his dedication to yuban coffee to which he replies , it 's perfect black , but better with something in it ! he is apparently referring to its flavor when mixed with any of the typical 'southern flavorings' \( taxed and untaxed , regulated and unregulated \) that he occasionally adds to his morning brew he is definitely one satisfied customer and it makes my life easier \( one less present to find each occasion \) so take his actions and my word for it ! br br \( 1 \) if she only comes over for breakfast it sure seems like a long way to drive , and please , tell me again , why does she bring so many clothes \? no sir , i did not know that , do tell when exactly did the cdc recommend showering before breakfast \? . 
7 11 07 great pre ground coffee in small enough containers to stay fresh until used i drink a lot of coffee , so the convenience of having one rich enough to buy pre ground coffee means a lot to me on my own i go through one can a week so amazon , let 's make this a subscription ! be sure to check the free shipping or you might get a shock though haha br br 6 16 09 gotta say the price has gone up on this way too much ! i ordered a case at 50 and checked the local supermarket they were 87 cents per can cheaper ! . 
yuban is one of the best coffees available , but not sold in all areas amazon 's case price is unbeatable ! ! i get a case every 8 weeks , always on time ! ! . 
this coffee reminds me of dunkin donuts coffee , which is all the rage now i like both dd and yuban about equally , but i opt for yuban because of the price this is really great coffee at a reasonable price it 's a light roast if you 've never tried yuban , maybe try one can before committing to the 12 pack if you 've tried it and like it , then you know this is a good deal . 
i love cofee yuban is one of the better ones maxwell house is also not too bad and there are some other ones that are pretty decent yuban is rich , robust , and stronger than most other coffees i have tried yet not bitter overall , i highy recommend it . 
i first tasted yuban while visiting my brother 20 years ago he offered me a cup of coffee one morning , and i really liked it it had a taste that was way different than i was used to i asked him what it was and he said yuban and to my suprise , it also was decaf i have never liked decaf , but this was better than any coffee i had ever tasted we were all in yuma for the winter when we got home , we started drinking yuban decaf i have since switched back to regular yuban , but my wife still uses decaf we were drinking maxwell house at the time found out later that yuban is part of maxwell house yuban costs about a penny a pot more that i am more than ready to pay for the better taste maxwell house is great coffee , and my 2nd choice we carry our own coffee and coffee makers with us when we travle we live in s w missouri and can only find yuban regular here , so we order it from amazon , and have had good luck dealing with them we have had several friends switch to yuban after tasting ours . 
what can i say it 's our favorite brand of coffee , it 's affordable , and it 's delivered to our door ! i think that pretty much sums it up . 
yuban is a smooth , rich tasting coffee unable to purchase this product in the retail stores in the chicago area the price of the coffee is very reasonable the twelve ounce cans keep the coffee fresh i am very pleased with this product and will purchase it through amazon again when i run out of yuban . 
we 've been drinking yuban since 1979 and find this the most convenient way to get it the price is great and it faithfully comes every month if we are having guests we can bump up the order fantastic . 
we were looking for a smooth , rich , non acidic , non bitter coffee when we came upon amazon 's reviews for yuban coffee well , we 've been buying yuban original roast ground coffee from amazon for about a year now , and folks , what can we say , it 's still the best tasting coffee around coupled with our marvelous bunn coffee maker \( also an amazon purchase \) which makes a fresh , hot pot of coffee in 3 minutes , it just does n't get any better than this br keep checking back weekly to see what the going price is \( it fluctuates up and down quite a bit \) and when you can catch it at a great deal , buy some you wo n't be disappointed . 
best coffee in the world when you open a can and sniff ahhhhhhhhhhhhh ! br br ca n't go wrong with yuban . 
this coffee is better than mcdonalds , starbucks , atlanta bread , folgers , maxwell house and almost as good as standard coffee that is served in up scale restaurants only and cannot be purchased privately it has a great smooth taste we have a hard time finding it in sc it is manufactured in ca on the west coast i called yuban today and they could tell me what stores in my area have sold it in the last 30 days br you can also purchase it on line is what i did for 12 cans the price beat the price i pay at the grocery store and i had free shipping ! ! ! ! ! woohoo ! ! ! ! ! ! enough to last the rest of the winter and spring try it ! you will love it ! . 
very good coffee ca n't always find it in our local stores , so i order it thru amazon every 3 months . 
they have this coffee at where i work and before this , they had this horrible folgers coffee which had to be diluted with sweetner and creamer i can actually drink this black because it 's actually good ! it tastes like a coffee that was brewed from a cafe , not just your coffee machine at home good stuff . 
this particular type of yuban coffee is a mild , flavorful coffee that can be enjoyed in the morning or anytime it 's the coffee my mother seems to prefer over all others not always available in stores , i was thrilled when i found it for sale by amazon ! . 
if you like strong coffee , this is it ! the flavor is exceptional , i have not found better in a can this can be expensive and difficult to find at your local store i have had great luck with amazon , good price for the subscription order \( you can get a case a couple times a year and still get the reduced rate \) amazon also has a wonderful return policy ! br try yuban if you love strong coffee and have not found the coffee for you , this may be it ! we have been drinking it for 10 years now have had the original , organic and dark roast i dont have a preference , they are all excellent . 
my husband and i recently moved here from las vegas to steeler nation we have tried ever coffee on the shelves at all the supermarkets far and wide we had been drinking yuban for at least 10 years in las vegas we called the district manager for kraft and found out that east coast people do n't like it or were not accustomed to it west of the mississippi is where you 'll find it so we had to order by the case load to satisfy our drinking pleasure we got the best deal from br amazon and it arrived very quickly without paying anything extra in shipping fees time to order it again ! ! . 
this ground coffee is almost as good as fresh ground coffee beans my husband is a coffee snob and he loves this coffee i have to admit the fresh ground is better , but yuban makes a really good ground coffee do n't waste your money on folger 's or maxwell house , this is the best ground coffee out there . 
we just love yuban coffee and there is not a store where we live that has yuban for sale i was delighted to discover that i could order it at amazon com by the case and always keep it in our pantry the only thing that could be any better would be that i could get yuban beans so i could grind it myself as i make a pot of coffee . 
yuban has been my coffee of choice for 20 years the price at amazon is very good i recommend this product for any coffee lover . 
i can no longer find yuban on the grocery shelfs it is by far the best coffee delicious flavor and no acid i would highly recommend yuban . 
a 25 price increase since the end of november , from 37 28 to 46 65 is it still a bargain \? br br now we 've passed the 50 mark , which comes out to 5 57 per pound i pay 5 6 per pound for fresh roasted beans in five pound lots br br if the rating were just for the price , i would make it three stars . 
very good product , will purchase over and over again a convenient way to purchase . 
my friend at work and i both eat sunflower seeds quite frequently we always try new types when we find them he came back from out of town with these a few weeks ago , and we 're both hooked they are definitely the best sunflower seeds either of us has had not only is the flavor fantastic , but the seeds themselves are top notch first , they 're huge second , there are surprisingly few broken or empty shells third , as of yet i 've never had a mushy , foul tasting seed sadly , we ca n't find anywhere around us that sells them , so i'm glad amazon does i'm really looking forward to trying the other flavors from this company as well he brought more back from out of town today i'm eating them now , and that is what prompted me to look online for a place to order from . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b000ldomt6 salt pepper flavored giants sunflower seeds a br br i found these seeds in a local store only to fall in love with them and then find the store no longer supplied them i am so glad they can be purchased at amazon warning ! ! ! they will ruin your desire for any other kind of sunflower seeds ! great ! . 
these sunflowers seeds are of a great quality in every bag and the flavor of the salt pepper is very bold i love these and the shipping service from the company has been great every time i have ordered . 
i have ordered this product twice now and the service and product have been great would order again ! ! ! br price of product was comparable to others thank you . 
bought these at a local store due to the great ingredients with none of the bad chemicals , and have been waiting for them to be in stock here i 'll definitely buy more when they are available , as they are the best shortbread cookies i 've ever had , my son agrees , and i love that they 're basically as good as you could get if you made them yourself , with ingredients you can pronounce and wo n't kill you \) so delicious ! ! ! . 
i gave these packs out as christmas goodies , but saved myself one delicious ! the gifts were well received also . 
i started getting this folger 's half caff coffee from amazon because our small town stores do n't always have it it comes in one pound vacuum sealed packs so it stays super fresh and it just fills my canister with one bag i like not having to get rid of all those plastic cans and i have it automatically sent to the door so i do n't have to deal with those last minute trips to the store and find they are out what a boon for rural , small town people like me . 
i love this coffee ! ! i had always mixed my decaf and regular to get 1 2 caffeine and now i can just buy it ! ! perfect amount for me i enjoy the flavor of coffee ! br br these vacuum sucked packages make it easy to store and use it keeps the coffee fresh ! ! i use then to refill another container and it works well for me ! ! . 
this is a terrific deal for a coffee lover that needs to cut back on his her caffeine consumption great tasting coffee and great deal can spend over 5 for it at the grocery store i get mine by the subscription plan for a little over 4 plus no tax . 
oh boy , these are a winner at my house we used to buy them locally , but they are no longer carried \( br my husband found these after trying other brands and these are the ones my son loves them as well they were delivered quickly and were fresh they said they almost had a pop to them we will definitely order these again they are heavy , so shipping was a little high , although we hope they will come back to w . 
i love wasa crisp 'n light crackers ! as their name suggests , they do have a very light and crisp texture they are still strong enough to support hummus or other spreads you may like to use however , they are also very delicious by themselves sometimes you just want something to crunch without wasting a lot of calories on chips or other fattening foods , and a stick of celery is n't what you had in mind i keep these in the pantry all the time they are low sodium and contain just 20 calories per cracker . 
these are very healthy 7 grains and very light and crispy , perfect with dips or salsa tastes just like rice cake they are very easy on the teeth too , for those who have dental work that they do n't want to chip hard to find in supermarkets . 
we are trying to curb our carbohydrates the wasa crisp'n light is a big help especially when you need something crisp we have and will continue to order this product thanks amazon for selling this tasty cracker . 
hubby and i both have teeth that ca n't handle anything too seedy or hard i also lost 81 lbs \( so far \) doing a lower carb diet \( not low , but lower \) i pretty much skip bread these days and cereal , etc but i do n't mind using up some of my starch carb calories on these so versatile to dip to make cracker sandwiches to use breakfast type spreads on \( when a craving for bagels toast hits \) i love them with hummus , with cheese , cracked over soup , topped with egg salad , with neufchatel and sugar free preserves \( i use nature 's hollow \) they are so nice to have with my breakfast omelettes br br even my super picky hubby likes them we both adore the texture oh , man how perfect the lightness that preserves a nice , gentle crispness br br wasa , please do n't ever stop making these br br i like this one and the mild rye both are now staples here satisfy my bread needs without a ton of carbs and since i restrict myself to 1200 calories , two of these do little damage to my eating plan at 20 calories each i also like to watch my sodium \( middle aged and almost off blood pressure meds \) , and these do n't pack on the salt br br thumbs up ! br br now , if they could make one that 's like an everything bagel an everything crispbread light and crispy version with the onion garlic sesame seed poppyseed how cool would that be \? \( or maybe they already have , dunno \) br br update i do n't eat gluten anymore , so i do n't buy this product these days for those who do n't care about grains gluten , i can still recommend it based on texture taste calories but not for me as i'm trying to stay gluten free be well . 
i love the light texture and the taste kind of reminds me of chex cereal which is a good thing it makes a great snack , i use laughing cow cheese wedges spread it on and lay down some spinach or radishes with smoked sardines or tuna delicious ! or instead of using a crostini to make bruschetta , i use these crackers and if i'm too lazy to make stuff , i just snack on it by itself . 
the title just about says it all these crackers \( crispbread , if you will \) are light and airy and come in around 4 grams of carb each i cut them into 8 pieces with a sharp knife and use them for dips , as well as conveyers for cheese and other goodies they have become my favourite snack yes , they are bland , but i like the fact they pick up the flavour of what they are served with and do n't overpower . 
these crackers are very delicious , have a wonderful texture , adapt well to any spread , and they are only 20 calories each great for people watching their calories they are very satisfying , and they contain whole grains in a tasty form . 
i really do love these crackers they are crisp , tasty and low in calories i have been eating them with a small bit of mayo and potted meat in the morning with my cappuccino they have helped me lose weight regardless of that fact , i just like the taste . 
both my wife and i have been using this product for well over a year we love it ! it is one of seven or eight varieties made by this producer recently , each of the other flavors have been available at our local markets , but , for some reason , these markets have been unable to obtain this flavor i was excited to find it on amazon com , and obtain a generous supply with no hassle , and with convenient shipping direct to my home comparable products do n't seem to have the same flavor or consistency , and this one , mixes well with any number of cheeses and or jellies jams at snack time . 
these crackers are certainly crisp and light i am a low carb eater and am happy to have something crunchy to munch on while watching my carbs \( 4 net carbs per cracker for atkin 's followers \) if you are used to buying different flavors in the grocery store , the ones that come in the kind of flimsy paper wrapping , these actually arrived in a more sturdy cardboard box for the people complaining about bland taste , i think the point is to put stuff on them not necessarily eat them as is i like that they have a very mild flavor so as not to overpower what you put on them , you can top with something savory or sweet my favorite toppings are cream cheese , ham and cheese , chicken salad or sugar free preserves \( they are sturdy enough to stand up to spreading cold cream cheese on them \) . 
i buy these at a local grocery store , not from amazon com br br they are absolutely lovely light and crisp , they 're like naked cheetos , that are actually fairly healthy they can be topped with most anything , sweet or savory great for midnight snacks , afternoon snacks , or crumbled up in tomato soup at lunch or dinner wish they 'd make them in flavors , they 'd beat the pants off most diet snacks i 've ever seen ! . 
while visiting my daughter in seattle , wa she introduced me to these wonderful wasa wafers \( alliteration intentional \) i really like them and they are an ideal substitute for bread i could n't find this product in the stores around fresno , ca i decided to give amazon a try and sure enough , they came through i subscribed to have shipments sent to my home quarterly and again amazon came through you amaze me ! a href http www amazon com gp product b000eujlhe wasa crisp 'n light 7 grain , 4 9 ounce boxes \( pack of 10 \) a . 
my daughter absolutely loves this stuff and she is a very picky eater it is also hard to find in the supermarket . 
i bought these one time at my local safeway and absolutely loved them i dipped them in a creamy cucumber dressing and the combination was awesome next time i went to buy a box gone , not even a spot on the shelf where they might have been sold out this happens to me frequently i find a product and really like it and then the next time i go to purchase it , it 's gone i looked for these crisp 'n lights at all our large grocers and other stores like target and rite aid no luck fortunately , i picked up a case here on amazon and will covet every box . 
i love these so much i 'd give them a 10 star i love them so much i have an amazon subscription so they get mailed to me regularly i discovered them at henry 's but they 're the only cracker on the shelf that are always sold out so when i saw the 10 pack here i was so happy br br i eat them as a bread substitute with everything ! ca n't go wrong with the calories and they do n't have a strong flavor to mask the food so really they can be eaten however way you like endless possibilities . 
wasa has a great line of 'crackers' , but these have become my favorite they are light but not wimpy their flavor is fairly neutral so they do n't conflict with whatever you choose to put on them and for me , the calorie count was the final winner only 20 calories per cracker and low sodium a winner all the way around and amazon has the absolute best price ! . 
these crackers are perfect you know why \? br because they have a subtle light flavour that does n't overpower whatever you 're eating on top of them whether it be guacamole , hummus , or mustard and cheese \) . 
we love these crackers for our salmon spread they have just the right flavor and crispness to enjoy the taste of the spread and they 're healthy ! . 
this crackers are so good they have very little calories , very little fat and still they are crunchy and creamy i'm on a diet right now and these really help me on my craving moments depending on my caving i can eat them plain or with turkey or a spread my kids and their friends love them too and eat them with cream cheese which makes a very healthy snack buying them on amazon was a great idea because they cost less , they are fresher than in stores and i do n't even have to go to the store to get them . 
i bought wasa crisp'n light crackers at my local supermarket yesterday because they were out of the wasa rye crackers i usually by that i really like this was the last box and i am so happy i bought it ! i love these ! i enjoy most of the crackers by this company , but this is now my absolute favorite and i plan on buying it through amazon because it is cheaper , i can save time and gas physically shopping and the convenience \( amazon has great customer svc \) is what i appreciate ! by the way , i enjoy these crackers plain and i 've eaten them with salmon cooked lightly in olive oil and capers and it was superb ! . 
we love this crisp bread because it 's made from 7 whole grains , does not contain any corn syrup and stays fresh for weeks after being opened it 's soft yet crunchy and tastes great can only recommend and will definetly buy again . 
since i am counting calories i find wasa crisp'n light very tasty you can eat three of them and feel like you are eating a lot more than you really are i think the taste is great and have told all my friends about them . 
once i tried these i was hooked good healthy food that tastes good alone or with tuna or seafood salad light crispy and melts in your mouth . 
great low carb alternative , they arrived fresh , and unbroken , i'm satisfied with amazon and with purchase again . 
as a person who has metabolic syndrome \( and my roommate has insulin resistance \) , we both always have to watch our carb intake giving up foods such as pasta , potatoes and most breads has been a very difficult , but also a very necessary part of my life over the past several years i 've tried lots of other low carb crackers \( including other wasa crackers \) , but they 've just been so so about six months ago , i picked up a wasa crisp 'n light cracker for the first time and wow , what a taste ! spread a little bit of earth balance on it , or some low fat cheese and it 's absolutely melt in your mouth delicious ! i'm so glad that i can get a case every three months through my amazon subscription . 
when i was diagnosed with diabetes 5 years ago , i thought i was doomed to a bland diet for life not true ! especially , when i found wasa crisp lights , it solved some of my problem with a thin coat of you wo n't believe it 's not butter and thin slices of banana , i have a desert or tasty snack without the banana , i can just eat them as bread , and they are so light and thin with the spread they are so tasty , and i do n't feel guilty after eating them i can put cooked or raw tomato on them , with a dash of sage basil to add to the flavor i have successfully kept my blood sugar normal consistently with diet control i am not doomed to a bland diet , after all br a href http www amazon com gp product b000eujlhe wasa crisp 'n light 7 grain , 4 9 ounce boxes \( pack of 10 \) a . 
these little gems are only 20 calories each and almost fat free , and taste way better than a rice cake , imho i'm glad they come in packs of 10 boxes because otherwise the husband and kids would eat them all and there 'd be none left for me ! . 
i love these crackers they 're perfect when you want the light crunchy snack without the calories of other crackers they 're good topped with lox or cinammon and sugar . 
i love these light , airy crackers three of them are only 60 calories on ww , just 1 pt ! spread with reduced fat peanut butter , just 3 pts a light part of a light lunch ! i used to buy them at the supermarket , but they do n't always have them when i found them on amazon , i was thrilled ! and using the automatic reorder feature , saved me 15 and no cost shipping ! woo hoo ! might i add , you can change the frequency of that at any time . 
i think these are a bit boring \( i like my cooked peas at least salty and preferably spice enabled \) but they do undeniably taste like peas , and my toddler begs for them \( peas ! peas ! \) i suspect she likes the crunchiness i bought a single package to try them out and bought the multi pack today i think they 'd probably be good in homemade trail mix , too . 
i order these peas and they came fast the product br has a good flavor and i am very happy with the peas br i will order with them again . 
great snack and good on salads it 's dried peas , what else can i say \? . 
just wanted to compliment this company on their great , prompt service and the freshness of the cookies bought them to give as a gift , and when i brought them home my kids ate them lol i would recommend these cookies to anyone and everyone . 
this is absolutely the best sauce for making carolina barb q i , ve looked for a long time and am glad that i finally found the best . 
i have been using this peppered gravy mix for years i found it at a wonder bread discount store at least 15 years ago it is the best you could ever make i always made from scratch , but i believe this is even better unless i tell them , no one knows it was n't made from scratch so easy , and can use it for pork sausage , chicken , even ground beef if you have n't tried it , you do n't know what you are missing good price , best taste . 
this mix makes a gravy that taste like your good ole southern grandmother made the gravy no more lumps and everyone thinks you made it from scratch if you are thinking about it you have to try this it is the best thing since the invetion of peanut butter . 
this gravy is great ! 1 4 cup has only 50 calories and 6 grams of carbs , which has helped my husband loose over 20 pounds how \? well the low carbs helped , but the main feature that makes low cal low carbs part of the formula work , is the great taste this gravy has got a peppery tang that makes it just right for spicing up eggs or chicken or anything else you might through a white pepper gravy over br br and i do n't know if you have tried other packaged sauces , but i have , and generally they are n't very good even when freshly made worse , these sauces tend to get 'strange' in the fridge overnight \( oddly watery , or jell like yuck \) this s m gravy mix does n't do that , which means that it 's good for several meals br br highly recommended for the gravy challenged my southern reared husband is a content and thin br br pam t br mom , reviewer at large , and wife to gravy lover . 
my wife always made her own gravy from scratch and is good at it however , this gravy is fantastic , idiot proof \( even i can make it \) and reminds me of my grandma 's cooking my wife loves it and this will definitely be a new staple for our cupboard . 
my wife use to make homemade peppered gravy which would take a long time to make and a big mess also when we discovered this pepper gravy , we decided that there was no need for the time and mess to make homemade as this was as close as you can get to homemade and again without all the time and mess as indicated by others , the addition of other ingredients such as sausage is also quite simple we would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys peppered gravy . 
forever for the perfect easy peasy gravy mix this is my fave ! tastes just like the restaurant ones i love so much like bob evans , and ihop . 
this is a very delicious gravey mix i add a pound or so of browned , drained breakfast sausage after it is heated and serve over bisquits it is super fast and easy i serve with cut up fresh fruit and there you have a simple , quick breakfast or brunch meal ! i would highly recommend . 
we were looking for a tasty , spicey gravey mix when searching the internet we saw this item and br decided to try it what a lucky find it is all we anticipated and more , being easy to prepare as well br as tasty and spicey now we need look no further when we run out we know where to go to order br it . 
the gravey is wonderful it taste just as good and the one from scratch except it is not as greasy . 
we love this stuff ! ! ! i use it in my heat and eat breakfasts i make in advance so i do n't have to cook every morning my wife uses it for all kinds of recipes including just as really good gravy we used to buy it all the time in california but it 's not sold locally so we have to mail order it much less expensive from amazon even over the manufacturer for us the larger 4 5 oz size is much more economical than the 2 5 oz . 
very good taste and a good price , no sales tax , no shipping charges and delivered to my door . 
this is by far the best peppered country gravy mix you can buy ! i have tried them all \( almost \) it is also very diverse in what you can do with it add sausage for sausage gravy , chicken broth and chicken for an awesome creamy chicken gravy same with turkey , ham , etc nothing compares to sm 's mixes , unless you make it from scratch and are good at it . 
absolutely amazing ! this gravy wins over any other hands down for that good ole down home country taste ! br br my neighbor i frequently eat meals together yesterday i slow cooked pork chops in about 3 cups of water , with diced potatoes , onion , pepper , frozen speckled butter beans , parsley , sage a can of cream of chicken soup for seasoning she made mashed potatoes after removing the pork chops , added a pack of this gravy mix to the sauce right in with the beans diced potatoes for a lovely rich gravy i do n't recall a meal like it since my grandmother 's house ! we saved the leftover gravy , and tonight we 're cooking chicken corn to serve with it ! br br i now have this saved so we can keep ourselves in gravy heaven ! thank you amazon com for carrying this southeastern mills for a quality , reasonably priced , fantastic gravy ! . 
the southern mills gravy is a very satisfying gravy for an easy fast topping for either bisquits or hashbrown potatoes br br the mix is easy to use and there are never any left overs it hits the table and it is gone everyone seems to love it . 
this is such a nice change from ordinary ketchup more pizzaz ! i 've been putting it on everything it 's great on eggs and hash browns i'm glad i bought 6 bottles shared some , and am going through the rest pretty fast it 's hard to find locally . 
our local grocery stores no longer carry tobasco ketchup , so went out to the internet and found it on amazon i do n't use ketchup all the time for everything , but when i do , i like it spicy good stuff i do n't know why our local grocers do not carry it any more this seller delivered the product in a timely manner as well . 
really good quality tea much superior to twinings as tea the releasable plastic lined paper bag is much superior to the tins to keep excess air out this is important so the tea wo n't oxidize the tins look nice , but they hold too much air and do n't reseal like a plastic zip seal . 
beautiful clear reddish in the cup and delicious with no off taste or bite recommended without hesitation just opened the bag , and i'm ordering some more already . 
this product is delicious i will say this upfront thou semi messy \( why not place the peanut butter in the center \? \? \? instead on the back \? \) the taste is great so great that i started to eat them all day not good as it ruins the enjoyment ! ! ! br br these are actually so good i had to stop eating them ! ! ! \( i guess i over did it ! ! ! \) br br value excellent snack for everyone \( all my friends love them \) family br br shipping fast \( as always with amazon prime membership 2 days \) br br packaging 6 boxes total each contains 6 individually wrapped granola thins \( 1 3 of granola bar but flat with peanut butter on one side seriously \) br br also do not ruin the granola as i did by eating every day ! ! ! also i notice to avoid mess just open with scissors ! ! ! \( pealing makes a mess ! ! ! \) br br exclusively . 
perfect mid morning snack for someone like me who is currently doing a meal replacement drink for breakfast one of these and piece of fruit is just what you need to get you to through to lunch . 
have to say i used to eat the nature valley peanut sweet and salty bars , then when these granola thins came out and i tried them , i just can't stop eating them the peanut butter favor is my fav tried the dark chocolate and wasn't too impressed but i swear i could eat a whole box in one day of the peanut butter flavor if i let myself i have read other reviews about them being messy and they are a little but that doesn't stop me from enjoying them they are a little crumbly and the peanut butter sticks to your fingers a little but who cares the people who said the peanut butter stuck to the wrapper must be storing them in very hot environments i have not had this problem at all ! love , love , love them ! ! ! try them you won't regret it . 
as a registered nurse who is also diabetic , i especially like the convenience of the nature valley granola thins for a quick pick me up if i experience low blood sugars the best part of this product , though , is the taste ! the worst part is that the actual thin is 2 4 bites and gone all deliciously , though they do make a log of crumbs so i suggest eating it over a saucer or napkin , do n't miss morsel of this incredible product ! ! . 
these are so good and also healthy for a snack only 2 weight watcher point and 90 calories when i was in girl scouts in the 60 's there was a cookie like this savannah it was an oatmeal crunchy sandwich cookie filled with peanut butter icing the first bite i took i was back there it was so good i love that they are wrapped one to a pack and not double i eat one everyday they range from 2 98 to 3 89 a box in my area so the subscribe and save is the way to go i tried the dark chocolate and they are also good but the memories the peanut butter ones bring with the flavor are my favorites br br if you remember those cookies you will love these if you like peanut butter and a healthy granola taste then hit the add to cart button fast you will not regret it yummmmmmmmmmy . 
it 's been a month or so since i read the other reviews but if i remember , some found them to be a bit messy to eat i have n't had any problems , even when keeping a box on top of the fridge where it tends to get a little warm , , but the piece of plastic coated cardboard that covers the peanut side peeled off cleanly without any peanut butter sticking to it and i had no problems eating the peanut butter coated thin would not recommend taking with you in your purse on a hot day as a snack however as i suspect they would get gooey if at higher than normal temperatures i just signed up for 1 month subscription so i wo n't run out i did run out the first time and i missed them so now i 'll have enough to last a month when i bought the first order , i could n't find them in local stores but have n't looked lately since i'm using amazon 's subscription program note that a single packet serving is not much food but i'm trying to control sugar intake and i have not found myself eating more than one at a time maybe because the foil packet is n't the easiest to get off \( not a problem \) and it 's not like caramel corn or oreos where i can keep eating so many that i do n't realize it until the package is empty i would recomment . 
these are wonderful ! but , they are small , so i usually eat 2 at at time and will melt easily and are hard to get off the paper so , i keep them in the fridge love them ! ! . 
my first exposure to patchi choclates was in abu dhabi , where patchi stores are found aplenty now that we are back in the states , amazon is the only place i 've been able to find patchi hooray ! the chocolates are as rich and delicious as i remember if you have never enjoyed patchi chocolates do yourself a favor and buy some ! . 
my husband i have always bought lucini vinegar 's but in todays economy we try to look for a substitution since lucini is expensive i hit the jackpot right off with cherry republic 's sweet cherry balsamic my husband i use the cherry vinegar straight up on our salad as dressing or on a plate of fresh sliced tomatoes so it can draw out the true flavor this vinegar is even sweet enough to sprinkle on a bowl of fresh sliced fruit for an extra kick but tart enough to use as basting on your fried chicken or fish you cant go wrong with this vinegar for the price so we say bye bye lucini 's cherry balsamic , now to find a great pear vinegar to replace another lucini type we use any idea 's \? . 
we have been trying several chilis by small companies via amazon and this one so far is our favorite i added some non soy meat substitute crumbles and that gave it a very nice texture . 
purchased this product at a local store in ny and my kids and i love it its a quick easy meal you can put in a toaster oven on toast for 6 min and its ready to eat br strongly recommend . 
i really love this oatmeal , it is such a lovely treat quick and easy to prepare and delicious as an ingredient for smoothies and even in flapjacks , a must buy ! ! . 
i am very excited that i have found this oatmeal it tastes great and it is quick to make when looking to go gluten free , so many of the books i was reading were offering eggs as a morning breakfast item i do n't like eggs so my life seemed pretty much doomed to silk milk smoothies this is a great breakfast option for me now my only gripe is that my grocery store cannot seem to keep it on the shelf so when i see if , i buy a couple of boxes . 
my 2 gf df girls love this instant oatmeal we have tried many many brands for a quick breakfast option and this one is by far the best it is a bit sweeter than old fashion oatmeal , but not overbearing by any means ! great start to the day ! . 
i love oatmeal for breakfast , but it takes so long to prepare it and then sweeten it and add mix ins that i usually do n't have time this instant granola is just about perfect the only thing wrong with it is that it 's a bit too sweet when i do n't have time to make oatmeal in the morning , i throw one of these packs into my bag and make it when i get to work it 's also a great portion manager it takes the guesswork out of how much oatmeal is in one serving . 
yay an all natural kids gum no bht preservative ! no dangerous artificial sweetners tastes fine and not bad for you ! . 
while beef stew is almost too easy to make , i will admit to not being great at replenishing my seasonings supplies as needed because seasonings and spices herbs are so expensive , i keep putting off purchasing them and the list to replenish them just keeps getting longer and longer eventually , i do n't have anything with which to work as such , i planned 2 6 qt crock pots of beef stew for over the holidays to always have something hearty and warm on hand for family as they came went lo and behold , when i finished cutting up all the meat and veggies and loaded them into the crock pots , i had nothing on hand to actually flavor those main ingredients so , sent hubby off to the grocery store for a quick cheat mccormick 's beef stew seasoning packets of course i never told him how many to get , and as he wanted to 'do it right the first trip' , he got a handful of them actually , in error , he grabbed the ones i 'd never seen before the slow cookers item man , oh , man ! to heck with buying expensive , one jar spices to keep on hand for this meal this product worked perfectly ! open packet , mix with 1 1 3 cups water , pour over ingredients in crock pot , mix it up just once and let the cooker rip for a few hours the stew was excellently cooked , beef was so tender one needed a spoon with which to lift it otherwise it would break apart and the veggies were tender but not mooshy it was more than flavorful the au jus was not too thick and not too thin perfect for sopping up with homemade bread that , unlike my spices , is always available in this house br br i liked it so much , as did the family members , i'm back to purchase the pack of 12 here to keep on hand as well as the slow cookers for pot roast i confess , for these two meals from now on , i'm being lazy , but quick and efficient no serious measuring , no countless bottles of assorted spices , no mess and a tremendous result br br note i did use 2 packets for each 6 qt slow cooker for although there is an easy recipe on the reverse of the packet , i do n't measure my meat and veggies i use what i have on hand and once the crock pot is at least 3 4 full , that 's when i usually throw in my seasonings the recipe provided would not be enough for my family i did n't notice any additional recommendations on the packets indicating how much for what size slow cooker i began with just one packet dissolved in the recommended 1 1 3 cups of water \( i used boiling water to dissolve it quicker add some warmth to the slow cooker as it begins cooking \) , but after pouring it over all the meat and veggies in the first pot , i just did n't think 1 packet was enough as my family likes a lot of the 'gravy' therefore , i added an additional prepared packet to each 6 qt crock pot which gave me perfect results br br this product uses only natural spices , no msg , 0g trans fat per serving and no artificial flavors br br edit 1 2 10 another batch made for new year 's this time , i reduced the amount of water per packet to 1 cup \( vs 1 1 3 \) and got thicker , more substantial 'gravy' vs the usual 'au jus' consistency the family liked it much , much better that way . 
my mother and i have been trying to find ground celery seed for some time now we have not been able to find it anywhere locally so i decided to purchase this product online hesitant to purchase food items online , i placed my order br br the product arrived well packaged and undamaged it was sealed and fresh if you are looking for a healthy alternative to celery salt , try this instead you do not get the salty flavor and a more robust celery flavor br br i just wish mccormick would package this in a smaller container again . 
i 've been looking for ground celery seed for at least 2 years it used to be always be avaialbe at grocery stores with the rest of the spices , but for some reason stopped being there regular celery seed is easy to find , but not the ground version so , i found online i wanted mccormick \( or some familiar brand \) i'm very satisfied with what i ordered it 's very good and fresh my only complaint is that i could n't purchase a smaller quantity than two large 16 oz containers i do n't use that much , so gave away the one container to a friend , and it will take me years to use 16 oz container that i kept ! \) but , happy to now have found hope for others that mccormick decides to package in smaller quantities . 
i 've tried a number of high quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them , and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats for one thing , these actually look like fish you open the can , and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can , instead of the weird , mystery paste it pretty much smells like you 've opened a can of real fish , too \( not in a bad way , though i do n't share my cats' love of sardines \) br br one of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food i picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when i wanted to try switching to tiki cat , and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines there are a few different sardine varieties , so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them br br the picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food , but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to tiki cat , so i take that as her endorsement of this positive review . 
this food is so full of chunks that my cats just love they are normally on a variety of top quality pate foods , but i wanted to give them something to chew on and would take them longer than a few minutes to eat this is stuff kitty dreams must be made of for sure it is for both of mine anyway . 
my two feline food critics just love these sardines , and i love being able to give them these sardines each tiny can is stuffed with great big chunks of sardine , and my cats are in heaven when they get this for dinner this is super high quality cat food , a huge treat for any pampered pussycat out there who likes fish it makes a very nice change from all the tuna based foods out there , and i try to always have some on hand so i can vary my cats' diet . 
it 's all natural real food that you can see the difference my cat loves it so much that now we call him the tiki kitty . 
the cats love it i could live without the smell and seeing the pieces of cut up fish in it but the cats love it wish i would have purchased more the price was right and it is good quality food for them . 
my finicky calico just loves this food one of the few wet foods she will actually eat it is loved by our other three cats as well will definitely be buying this again . 
my cat tigger eats this stuff up fast then he asks for more so i figure it must be good this is not your typical cat food ! . 
my cat loved this food for a long time however , he has been picky lately it 's been harder and harder to get him to eat this , but the variety offered in this cat food is good and seemed to keep my cat healthy ! . 
i tried tiki cat variety pack and the only one my cats really ate well was the bora bora sardine cutlets in lobster consomme maybe one other flavor , i think the one with crab , they sorta ate , but definitely this one so , i ordered a couple packs of 12 small cans i feed them 1 can per day along with their dry food they also like weruva canned cat food and a new one called addiction canned cat food which so far they love all the flavors i got them my one skinny cat is super crazy over the lobster consomme part , but both cats eat it all nutritionally , sardines are really high in rna which is a building block and rna also contains the sugar ribose . 
i first learned bout tiki cat while searching for responsible and healthy food for my cats i tried many different brands of cat food before tiki cat i knew i had a hit when even my finiky cat came running for tiki cat food time they seem to like the sardines best , but i'm sure that every cat is different , and tiki cat has so many varities you 're sure to find one your cat likes amazon has the cheapest price for this product , and it 's delivered right to my door ! i 'll never have to drive to a pet store and pay extravagent prices for good cat food again ! . 
the oriental flavor ramen noodles taste okay but i almost always add ingredients to make the dish more wholesome i prepare it by adding sesame seed oil , vegetables and water then adding the seasoning and noodles after the water boils rough vegetables like chopped onions taste better if they are boiled with the seasoning for 15 minutes prior to adding the noodles . 
tried this in a turkey burger and it was sooo good i definitely recommend faery free salt can be added or better yet add a sprinkle of goya adobo . 
extremely good deal i placed the order on tuesday , got the package on saturday the packaging is very good \( vanilla beans are vacuum packed as well as comes with a heavy ziploc bag for after you open the vacuum pack \) 1 2 vanilla bean is about a little over 50 vanilla beans every grocery store i go \( wegmans , whole foods , weiss etc etc \) that carries vanilla beans usually only sells them in packets of 2 vanilla beans for typically 12 so if you buy 50 vanilla beans 2 at a time for 12 each , thats 300 ! so basically you 're saving 272 31 . 
i am a professional chef and specialize mostly in pastry , cakes , and desserts it plays hell with my diabetes but i just love creating some delicious dessert for friends when we have small gatherings br br i usually buy vanilla beans in tijuana , mexico because i can get good quality at a decent price by that i mean the beans tend to be supple , shiny , and aromatic by decent price i mean it usually costs me around 1 50 to 2 00 per piece br br when i saw this half pound package at such a low price i was skeptical but i figured the 25 would not be a big risk and if they were bad i can always return them i ordered on jan 11 and got them jan 13 free two day shipping being another great feature of my amazon prime membership which i now believe is an excellent value br br the beans are very high quality they are gourmet bourbon which means about 30 moisture \( a good thing \) and they are shiny and nicely oily \( you want the oily surface as that is one part where a lot of flavor is located the other part is in the seeds and that is the reason the bean is split and the seeds scrapped when used \) these beans are very fresh as shown by their flexibility \( as beans grow old they dry out and get brittle still usable but not as good \) they come sealed in a vacuum bag and that is inside a zip bag even through the double packaging the scent is very noticeable and complex br br this is a large quantity of beans if you are not going to use them rapidly i recommend separating into two or three bean lots and vacuum packing those for optimal shelf life i keep mine in a wine refrigerator \( it gets cool but not cold \) where i keep my 20 or 30 pounds of various chocolates br br this is an excellent deal on good quality i just ca n't figure out how they manage to make a buck on this one ! . 
there are a ton of vanilla beans in this package they are supple and so fragrant , you can smell them without breaking the seal truly a fantastic deal . 
just received my beans today and wow ! there 's an amazing amount for the price paid , they smell absolutely fantastic and came vacuum packed so they 'll keep practically forever . 
vanilla beans have many uses you can make vanilla sugar , creme brulee , and many other desserts you can also make vanilla extract and if you buy these beans , you can do it all at a fraction of the supermarket price br br yesterday i priced two vanilla beans in a spice bottle at the supermarket they cost almost 6 this half pound package of beans that comes in a vacuum pack contains at least 50 beans and cost only 25 i am not quite sure what i will do with all of these , but we did make some bottles of vanilla extract for our favorite cooks for xmas , and i have vanilla sugar in my cupboard now the fragrance of these beans is marvelous , but i have resealed the package so the beans wo n't dry out i may even put a few beans on the counter to make it smell like i have been cooking ! br br a recipe br br 1 cheap fifth of vodka br 10 12 beans , sliced the long way br br remove a cook 's share from the vodka bottle and replace with the beans close the bottle let sit for at least a month in a cool dark cupboard br br decant some of the vanilla into a smaller bottle when you need a refill put another sliced bean in there , and top off the large bottle with more vodka use the smaller bottle for your cooking make lots of cookies ! br br you can keep this up for about a year . 
i ordered and got this the next day planning to make vanilla for christmas presents \) there were 70 beans in my package thatsalottabeans i split it with a friend because i do n't think i know 70 people who love to bake on their own , they smell somewhat like raisins , but in the package , the smell is heavenly crossing fingers that the vanilla works out ! but at what , 40 cents a bean , i have n't lost much and the price is so much better than the grocery store , where i looked at 2 beans for 12 . 
i wanted to give homemade vanilla extract as gifts and was extremely satisfied with these beans they made very high quality extract and were much cheaper than at local grocery or organic food stores i was mildly concerned by the size i only needed 24 beans , and ended up with closer to 50 however , my brother has used the remainder to make delicious vanilla ice cream , creme brulee , tiramisu , custard , vanilla sugar , french toast , etc i have recommended them to friends and family . 
i do n't understand \( believe \) the one negative review posted here why are they the only dissatisfied customer \? br br my 1 2lb madagascar bourbon vanilla beans came in 2 days , and the whole box had the wonderful aroma of vanilla even before opening it ! br my dark , 8 long , moist pliable beans were vacuum packed and tucked neatly in a sturdy zip bag br br oh the plans i have for these gems ! ! br br i 'll be sure to post an update after utilizing my beans ! . 
i'm constantly trying to find vanilla beans at a reasonable price often , when i do , they are hard as rocks , dry , and practically unusable i was so frustrated at safeway where one bean was 13 \( ! \) , dry and hard as a rock the best i 've found was at trader joe 's , where i could get three beans for 10 they were decent br br this price was so reasonable , that i worried they were not going to be fresh good etc i was wrong the beans were incredibly fresh and supple i'm using them to make vanilla extract and they have worked perfectly they keep well in the fridge , so i'm using them in everything ! br br the price is great , but there might be too many to use if that 's the case , then split them with a friend then it becomes one of the best culinary deals ever br br absolutely wonderful i will buy these again and again . 
i 've never bought vanilla beans before , but i have seen them in the store all dry and crusty looking these beans are vacuum sealed , and because of that are still moist they smelled great my whole pantry smelled wonderful after i put them in there , and they made my homemade vanilla bean ice cream the most vanilla y ice cream i 've ever had \( even more vanilla y than blue bell ! \) when i run out , i 'll absolutely buy more of these ! . 
i just got these , they are moist and gooey and fresh i actually got more beans than the approximate ammount they came faster than expected great transaction ! . 
we were running out of vanilla i 'd made my own before using vanilla beans and vodka , and the price of these was far cheaper than getting them locally i figured it was worth a shot br br i'm not sure what i was thinking , but half a pound of vanilla beans works out to something like 50 of them it 's hard to picture 50 vanilla beans , but this would be a good order to go in halves on with someone or quarters br br the aroma is incredible it 's been a couple of months since we originally opened them , and our pantry still smells like vanilla , even though they are wrapped in two ziploc bags br br as for the vanilla itself , it is fantastic if you 've never tried vanilla produced yourself , you are absolutely missing out there is a distinct and definite difference between homemade and what you buy at the store br br do yourself a favor , hit add to cart and check out you 'll be glad you did . 
i purchased these vanilla beans to make homemade vanilla this is my first vanilla bean purchase ever i was very pleased with the quality of these beans there were approximately 50 beans , and they were large , very fragrant , and contained lots of caviar i could see the extraction starting to take place shortly after i split and immersed these in my vodka i should have some wonderful vanilla extract in 6 months thanks ! . 
what an incredible price for this many high quality vanilla beans ! ! br br i split them with a friend of mine and we 've both been making our own extract with delicious success at first i thought i might not be able to find use for all the beans , but because i love to make my own \( vegan \) ice cream , i'm now totally spoiled by these beans i grate them into my \( non dairy \) milk and simmer it , then let it cool in the fridge overnight , then go about making my ice cream i never want plain vanilla ice cream without using fresh beans again , no way ! it 's too good br br what 's more , have you ever bought beans from the grocery store \? it costs , like , 12 for two or three beans , and the beans are relative garbage these are n't dry and odorless like the ones from the store instead , they 're moist , soft , and have that delightful aroma that makes you just want to bake . 
it is a lot of beans to go through but the flavor and quality is really nice they are fresh , soft and very fragrant i use a lot of vanilla bean because my family loves vanilla sauce and baked goods made with the fresh bean you must seal these very tightly to keep them soft but with care , they will stay nice for months and you ca n't beat the price ! one company sells vanilla beans in a jar and you get two or three beans for anywhere up to 6 ! and the quality is n't anywhere near what these are i will continue to buy this product i 've ordered these before and i am still thrilled with the product . 
these vanilla beans are so fragrant that you can smell them through the unopened package ! i used them to make my own vanilla extract as christmas gifts , and they worked great ! do n't be fooled by the product photo they look stiff and dry in the image , but they 're soft , pliable , and moist with vanilla oil . 
i was very happy with the quick delivery of this product and how fresh the beans were i am looking forward to my homemade vanilla extract once it is done brewing i would definitely buy from this seller again . 
having been a professional cook for over 20 years i try to seek the best ingredients i was very pleased with this product from the moment you open the box you can smell them and they are still sealed in their bag they are very pliable unlike most of the big store ones and the seeds are very moist and easy to remove i needed to make a new batch of vanilla sugar and this was the first time i had to put some crackers in with it as the sugar was clumping within a week should make an interesting cracker too br john . 
got 58 beans in the 1 2 lbs package which is a great value they are moist so they are super fresh great find . 
i received my beans quickly and they smelled great ! i used all of them pretty quickly i purchased three 1 75 l bottles of vodka and split the beans evenly among them they were plump and looked great i'm excited to give my homemade vanilla as christmas gifts . 
i received these wonderful beans today through amazon i have not opened the vacuum sealed bag yet but the fragrance is divine they are about 6 3 4 inches long and plump and soft it looks like there are maybe 60 70 beans . 
arrived very quickly and packaged safely they are vacuumed sealed and then put within a thick plastic ziplock bag even with the packaging i could smell the vanilla when i opened my ups box there are so many beans in here , a very great buy for my homemade vanilla extract ! ! . 
i could smell the vanilla from the box it was packaged in it was sealed shut , air extracted from the packaging , so plump moist i specifically got this product based on the comments left from a pastry chef i am extremely happy with my purchase i will definitely be back for these again i use them in frosting and cake batters it 's soooooo good , words cannot describe the freshness you get with a real vanilla bean vs an extract they were very easy to extract the beans from . 
i highly recommend this seller it is an incredible value for both quantity and quality of beans there are probably around 50 60 beans , although i'm not positive because i have not taken them out of the packaging to count i have probably used about 8 10 beans and i can barely tell any are gone from the bag they come double sealed , and as another reviewer mentioned , you can smell the vanilla even through the original shipping package i have purchased grocery store vanilla beans , and i have never seen or tasted anything remotely close to the quality of these beans i will definitely purchase beans from this seller again . 
i got these 2 weeks ago , for the price i wasnt expecting much , but they are really fresh and fragrant br i 've used them to make bavarian cream and creme brulee and they taste great . 
i got the beans in the prescribed amount of time , and even before i opened the package i knew they were going to be great the amazing aroma of the beans was evident and only intensified after i actually opened the packaging i bought them explicitly to make my own vanilla extract , and i have to say they are some juicy beans i highly recommend them . 
the beans smell great and you get a lot of them if you get a 12 pack of jars and you put 2 beans in each jar , you will still have more than half of them left over im trying to figure out what else i can do with them before they go bad . 
great price wonderful product everything was as described shipped quickly and was priced great as far as i can tell i use these to infuse vodka \( slice the beans down their length first \) wonderful ! . 
i was amazed with how fresh these are and there are so many in 1 2 a pound my only suggested would be if you have another person that loves them as much as you do you could split the cost and the beans i have so many left over beans i 've been giving them away to grateful coworkers but what goes around comes around so here 's to awesome ingredients ! . 
great vanilla beans at a great price i recieved about 60 beans in my pack they are plump and perfect when i 've used them all up i will definitely be buying them again ! i almost did n't order them because of the reviews talking about the bad smell to them i'm glad i did n't listen to them they smell like all of the other vanilla beans that i 've bought . 
this is the buy of a lifetime 25 for about 50 beans instead of 10 for 2 ! and the flavor was great made ice cream that everyone raved about i vacuum sealed portions for future use to keep them as fresh as possible . 
i bought these vanilla beans about a month ago to make homemade vanilla extract and also to have on hand since i always seem to have some culinary use for vanilla beans i was very impressed with the quality the dried up store bought vanilla beans cannot compare to these will be ordering more soon ! . 
recieved vanilla beans in a nice bundle in a ziploc bag the smell was wonderful even through the bag my husband and i used the vanilla beans to make our own vanilla extract the beans were moist and easy to work with we were very impressed and would definitely buy the vanilla beans again ca n't wait to see how the homemade vanilla extract turns out . 
i got the wonderful vanilla beans about a month ago the first thing i did was to make vanilla sugar then i put 10 split beans in 3 4 cup mix of rum and brandy i shake it every other day smells wonderful so far i'm going to split a few beans to put on my stevia which i use every day i also sent a pack of madascar bourbon vanilla beans to my 78 year old big sister but she freaked out what will i do with these \? br so far i find these vanilla beans luxuriously wonderful smelly , soft and tasty if you just take a tiny bite in your morning coffee . 
these are unbelievably fantastic ! i had to share them , i had so many ! simply the best ! i put the leftover pods in my sugar , smells amazing ! . 
these have good flavor plenty of other reviews address that i also like the thick zipper bag they came in my only real issue with these is that mine grew mold i 've never had vanilla beans do that before these seemed unusually moist , so maybe that contributed to the issue it started as a small spot , but grew so that it was on the ends of most of the beans i finally got them all out , trimmed off the moldy bits , and froze what was left br br it took 2 3 months for the mold to start , so if you use them quickly maybe that wo n't be a problem but , i do n't go through them that fast i 've had beans dry out in the past , but this is the first i 've seen of mold if you do n't plan to use them within 2 months or so , i recommend keeping them in a fridge , freezer or coming up with some other way to stop the mold before it starts . 
these beans are trully wonderful and wonderfully priced split a few down the length toss in a bottle of vodka or rum or some bourbon for a few days and you have a wonderfull drink great for baking , make truly amazing vanilia bean cookies . 
these will last a long time the way we use them but could not pass up the deal came sealed and you could still smell the vanilla stick one or 2 in your favorite vodka and wait a few weeks we also make our own extract from them . 
the first thing you notice when you open up your package is the intensely delicious smell of vanilla the package is vacuum sealed , but the smell still leaks out these beans are a great deal ! i think i got about 28 32 pods in my bag and was able to make good use of them they \( as previously mentioned \) have a wonderful smell and great flavor it is really hard to find a better deal out there . 
these beans are magic plump , moist , potent the aroma was so rich that i could smell the deliciousness even before i opened the double wrapped , vacuum packed plastic bag the best thing , though , is the price for this outstanding quality two weeks ago , out of dire necessity , i paid over 8 for a single vanilla bean in my grocery store spice aisle the bean was fine , but 8 \? really \? when i saw these i rejoiced less than 50 cents a bean ! now that i have them and have had some home made vanilla ice cream made with them , i can safely say this is the single best value i 've ever found on amazon in all the years i 've shopped here i'm sorry the one buyer received a bad batch of these mine are perfect i will definitely be buying again . 
i was very pleased with my recent vanilla bean purchase from spice world when i opened the box , and not even unsealed the beans themselves , i could smell the fragrance of the bean , and see that they were in very good condition the have been very moist , easy to work with , and taste wonderful i ca n't recommend these people too much , and to say i was completely satisfied would n't do them justice i like finding a place i can shop from that will meet my demands for taste and quality i have a new home ! . 
well packaged , and alot of beans for the price \( 50 \) using them to make home made vanilla extract wounderfull flavor will buy again . 
the beans arrived in good time , moist and supple , no mold , very good flavor what else is there to want in regular bourbon vanilla beans \? i was very pleased with this purchase . 
i could n't be more pleased with my purchase vanilla beans are 5 9 a piece if you can find them in the store these work out to about 51 cents a piece and they are fresher and better quality than the 5 ones they also come vacuum sealed and a zip lock bag is included for storage after opening good job ! . 
i bought the vanilla beans to make diy vanilla extract i do alot of baking and i like to use good vanilla the recipe requires moist , full vanilla beans and these were wonderful the vanilla beans came in a vacuum pack that kept them in very good condition , much better than buying them from the spice section of the grocery store where the jar contains 2 to 3 dehydrated beans and they made great vanilla extract for much less money than buying the 'real' vanilla at the store . 
ca n't be the price ! the beans have a strong aroma and tasted great in creme brulee ! just be sure to have an air tight jar and a vacuum sealer is n't a bad idea either to keep them as long as possible . 
i got these beans based on the good reviews and was n't disappointed i also got 70 beans in my pouch , nice moist and supple pods that will make a gallon of vanilla extract great beans for a great price ! ! ! . 
i could smell the vanilla even through the packaging ! br there were lots of vanilla beans and they were all in great shape i'm excited to see how my homemade vanilla extract turns out ! . 
i 've ordered these before and i am still thrilled with the product they are fresh , soft and very fragrant i use a lot of vanilla bean because my family loves vanilla sauce and baked goods made with the fresh bean you must seal these very tightly to keep them soft \( i use the seal a meal \) , but with care , they will stay nice for months and you ca n't beat the price ! mccormick sells vanilla beans in a jar and you get two or three beans for anywhere up to 6 ! and the quality is n't anywhere near what these are i will continue to buy this product . 
cooking with fresh ingredients always makes your dishes taste , and smell , more delicious ! highly recommend purchasing these vanilla beans , they arrived vacuum packed and ready to use . 
these beans were amazing for the price plump , moist and delightful smelling made 1 5l of extract with them using silver rum for the alcohol . 
i was very pleased when i got these vanilla beans they were shipped in a timely manner and arrived vacuumed sealed there was a mix of some very plump beans and a few that were thin i was very happy with my purchase ! . 
these beans were vacuum sealed , very fresh and supple my only problem was that there were so many i had way more than what i needed for a dozen jars of vanilla flavoring that i'm preparing as christmas gifts highly recommend . 
i bake quite often and i love to use fresh vanilla beans i have purchased beans from a variety of places and these are the best vanilla beans i have ever used , hands down ! ! they were so moist and plump and loaded with seeds ! ! the fragrance and the taste was so amazing ! i used it in a birthday cake and everyone raved about the taste i receieved 70 \( yes seventy \) half sized beans in my 1 2 pound package it would have cost me over 220 to purchase that many beans in the store ! i have a food saver so i divided up the package into smaller packages and have them sealed up and stored in a dark pantry i will be interested to see how long they keep . 
better than expected ! well packaged , moist , fresh and fragrant beans were just what i needed for my recipe perfect would not hesitate to order this bargain priced , excellent product again . 
to purchase this many vanilla beans for the price is great br i 've not split any of them yet , but they look nice and plump br the way a good bean should look i have them all soaking in br a big jar of vodka to make vanilla in six months , i should have br some pretty good quality vanilla , and will still be able to use br the vanilla beans for other things . 
i use these vanilla beans to make my infamous creamy vanilla caramel ice pops , a fan favorite for my small gourmet popsicle business frontporchpops it 's tough to find these locally for a reasonable price so i ordered these from amazon instead as a time saver i was dubious about ordering product online \( what chef does n't what to taste , touch and smell it before they decide if it 's worthy of their customers \? \) , but i was pleasantly surprised to receive moist , flavorul vanilla beans that were exactly what i wanted i just wish they offered this as a subscription so i could have them automatically sent every month . 
these bean smelled so fresh , they were moist and plump i'm very impressed with the quality of the beans that were shipped to me i ca n't wait to use them in all of my baked goods ! . 
these beans arrived quickly and were well packed in a vacuum sealed pouch there were lots and lots of long , supple black vanilla beans they smelled great and were very pliable i immediatley made some vanilla sugar , which 3 weeks into it , smells wonderful i intend to add beans to vodka for extract i also added several beans to oil to make a wonderful vanilla oil for salads there are so many beans , i will make a few gift budles wrapped in raffia for my family and friends the leftovers seem to be keeping quite nicely in my room temp pantry i just need more ideas for the rest of the beans . 
i was tired of paying upwards of 12 for two beans at the local store , so i thought that i would give these a try i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the beans i was expecting the usual dried out lackluster vanilla flavor i have enjoyed from the super market spice rack , but these beans are so much better i used to live near a natural food store that carried an excellent selection of fresh spices , unfortunately with the recession they closed down these beans rival those that i could purchase there they have a robust vanilla flavor that came through very nicely in the ice cream i made i was used to doubling up on the beans in the recipe to get the vanilla flavor i wanted , but quickly found out that i did n't have to with these beans highly recommended ! enjoy ! . 
i loved this the beans where fresh and the smell heavenly i most definately would buy this again the more expensive ones in the supermarket are dry and way over priced these were very juicy loved it ! ! . 
i like to eat frozen vanilla yogurt but the catch is that i have to make it myself or it doesnt get done br br these vanilla beans are amazing if you are really into vanilla yougurt or icecream . 
i have always liked the oskri bars but these with the fennel in them are even tastier a great gluten free , no cane sugar , no cornsyup , treat for those being health conscious also get a little protein to boot ! mmmmmmm mm ! . 
i babysit for my good friends' kids , to give them a 'date night' every now and again br br these things are always in their freezer b c they know i am a horrible cook i always thought 3 year olds were picky eaters , but the twin boys beg me to heat up 2nds for them ! . 
my daughter loves them they are easy to heat up and good for the body and earth it 's the perfect weekday dinner for us busy mums and it 's so clean to eat , that 's the key not as messy as mac n' cheese thanks peas of mind to make my life easier . 
universally popular with all dogs and is the only treat my pets will eat great that it is all natural . 
the best treats available your dogs will go bonkers for these i buy a tub a month for my little munchkins and they just love it good value online . 
i'm a profecinal cat trainer and have used several different treats including raw freezdried raw home made and comercial treats over the last 10 years these treats take the cake and run omg all cats clients cats love these treats they are the onlything i will ever use for training again best cat treat on the market just dont forget to cut them up in little pieces there to big for your average house cat br br if you have a finiky cat that dosnt like to eat well here is your god send just crush some up and toss there food in it its a garanteed way to get them to start eating again dont use a ton since its high in fat . 
my cats love freeze dried meats br they absolutely love these treats br they are the cheapest of all the treats i buy br the quality is good , too many small pieces though br br do not buy freeze dried beef liver as it is too hard on there tummies br br i only give them a couple of pieces a day but they know what time that is ! . 
my 3 boston terriers love these treats ! they are natural , wholesome and soft enough to break into multiple pieces we keep a steady supply of them in the house i order at least 2 containers at a time since we do n't want to run out amazon 's seller all pets has the best price around . 
at an early age my beagle \( yes , a beagle \) was picky about eating crushing a little freeze dried chicken liver on his food gave him the incentive to eat now it has become part of the routine . 
i buy chicken livers for my cat she has now learned to speak english persuasively in order to get these treats \( lol \) they are economical and obviously well liked by my cat . 
my dog absolutely loved these , and he would have given them a 10 rating if he could unfortunately he is nolonger with us , but he thought they were great for years , and this was the best price i ever found very prompt shipping , and adequate packing . 
my pugs are picky eaters and only like the chicken liver which is hard to find this is a great deal . 
it came promptly , dog is very happy for some reason , this batch has much smaller pieces than those that we have ordered in the past i guess the dog thinks that is better he gets more treats at one time \( even though the amout is about the same \) . 
i picked a can of this up on a whim at big lots for 1 30 and it is so easy i used one of those graham cracker pie shells , opened a can of this filling , and put it in the fridge in four hours i added some lime zest and whipped cream my friends did not believe how good it was for coming out of a can ! i went back the next day and bought what they had left on the shelf highly recommended ! ! . 
this is a very very good tea , bearing the name sibu english tea is really nice and really really really really really good . 
these chocolates are absolutely the best , smooth in taste and almost delicate in texture their an absolute must for any chocolate fan , i 've never been a fan of milk chocolate , but these fazer chocolates are the absolute exception ! i highly recommend these chocolates to anyone who loves chocolate as much as i do ! . 
when we lived in omaha we fell in love with pears coffee i was thrilled to find it on amazon for the price there is really no comparison we 've tried other flavors , but always end up going back to colombio supremo we are now on direct ship every three months with amazon try it it 's better than the grocery store options and less expensive . 
i bought the 4 pack of this coffee based on the reviews of others and the price it is a lot of coffee , since we drink less than 1 pot per day i really enjoy the flavor i put a little cream and sweetener \( agave nectar \) in my coffee , but this coffee has great flavor that comes through i'm not super picky on coffee , but i can tell when i have bad coffee this is definitely good coffee and i plan to keep buying this coffee as the only coffee we have in our house . 
awesome tasting tea in a 16 oz can ! i highly recommend this product because it taste great and does n't cost a lot . 
prince of tea brand teas are great the premium oolong tea is good , but i found that i like their organic oolong to taste better than the premium , and it generally costs less too prince of tea is a well known and environmentally concious company and you 'll do well to buy their products . 
i started loving oolong tea after i discovered a bottled product called 'tejava' that product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle i needed something less expensive so i tried this 'prince of peace' brand oolong br br after a few brewing experiments , i now love this stuff br br what i have learned if brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak if you put this tea in boiling water , it may come out bitter br br i now heat up my water in a microwave until it is , very hot to the touch , but no way near boiling i then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes \( i like strong tea \) i have , to my taste , duplicated the 'tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost br br enjoy br br ken . 
i drink three cups of this each day , made with one oolong tea bag and one green tea bag , in a large mug i believe this has helped me to lose about 8 lbs in the last five months i drink it without sweeteners , and also cold the price for this is very reasonable , and the taste is mild . 
unexcelled as to price and equal in quality to the best ! . 
i have been drinking oolong tea for several months now i find it quite a nice morning beverage instead of coffee it is also a great pick me up in the afternoon one of the benefits of oolong tea is increased energy , which for me it works this oolong tea is great tasting and light flavored i will definitely continue to purchase it . 
the tea tastes great hot or iced very good for the price i recieved the package fast with no problems . 
superior flavor , not too green , not too black loved it from the first cup i put a hint of splenda sugar blend in mine and am substituting it for coffee these days stumbled on it in a shop but will be getting it thru amazon in the future i am here now because after tasting it i wanted to be sure i could buy it on line and have it delivered to the door again , a definite yes product ! maggiemay . 
i want to give my cats as much variety as possible they are family and they matter variety makes them happy and their health wellbeing are important giving them good , healthy food and treats are apart of showing them how loved they are unfortunately , i have to go online to find some treats as the stores do n't carry the variety any more . 
it only takes a cursory look at my reviewing history to realize that i have n't exactly made a career out of rating gum , but this new trident vitality is so darn good that i thought i 'd better get in a few words on it i 've tried all three of the available flavors and ca n't seem to choose a favorite br br the peppermint with ginseng flavor reviewed here is definitely pretty awesome the gum has the physical profile of an old school chicklet it only takes a bite or two for the strong peppermint flavor to kick in and man , does this gum last i can usually go a good 3 4 hours and still get some flavor out of this stuff that makes it a good value in my book for sure br br typically retails for around 1 39 pack at my local grocer , although i 've caught it on sale for under a dollar once or twice br br highly recommended . 
i would have to say that my dog is a picky eater i have tried all types of different brands of food and finally found one that she loves she also suffers from skin allergies and even though she is on meds i think this food has helped a bit with her dry skin i only have one issue her breath smells really fishy after she eats but thats not even a big deal anymore also the price is cheaper than other online stores like petco and petsmart plus free delivery all in all if mona 's happy so am i . 
the natural balance alpha grain free trout , salmon meal and whitefish formula is working very good for my dog there is no digestive problems it also keeps the fur shinny be sure to provide a lot of water for the dog as he always drinks a lot an hour or two after the meals . 
i moved to las vegas from san jose last year and have been missing my peet 's coffee jasmine downey pearls tea when i saw this product i bought a shipment right away i was not disappointed i love the individual silken sachets of jasmine tea pearls it is fragrant and wonderful tea i will be buying it again . 
harney sons' dragon pearl jasmine tea is one of the cleanest and most delicate of commercially available teas i 've encountered br br my first experience with it was at the williamsburg lodge , in virginia , where it was served over the 3 days of an annual convention i attend there while a shame to have to sip it standing up or moving between speaker sessions , i had a remarkable sense of being elevated above the rush around me the bouquet is evocative and tended to linger in the air yet was in no way overpowering more like a stroll through a jasmine studded garden upon tasting , the first impression seems to register near the tip of the tongue , as if sweet , and as the flavor develops in the mouth there is a recognition that it is , in fact , tea but without insistent tannic or other strong overtones a fine impression remains when the cup is set down and the intake of breath recharges the sensation br br there is no settling of heavy flavors a cup is as fine and pleasurable from first sip to last i also have found that this tea maintains its character despite the array of waters i have used to make it some brews become distinctly unpleasant when the leaves are introduced to certain mineral rich well water or treated city water the best experience no doubt is when using filtered water , but it is not requisite to enjoying jasmine pearl br br as a wake me up tea on a work morning , i would likely choose a more robust leaf however , for a proper moment of relaxation or an attempt to induce one in the midst of chaos ! i hope to never run out of this tea . 
works good in the blender for shakes and ice slush br br can not find decaf in stores br br can add other flavors and spices to taste br br good for nutrition builder . 
i love big train ! there is a local shop that sales big train products after spending 20 a week on the stuff , i decided that i wanted to make it at my house sometimes to save a little money the individual bags are the exact bags that the local shop uses i do prefer the consistency of the product when made by the shop , i think that has to do with my blender 's age overall , this product is super yummy ! . 
these are so good , my next order will be on the monthly schedule br very easy to make and super delicious we used milk and chipped br ice , along with the mix i might try water one time to see how br that is i wish i could rate this product higher than 5 stars . 
i used to go to a local coffee shop to get these drinks for about 4 now i can make them at home for a fraction of the cost they are delicious ! i like the single serving packets , but my husband and i end up using three packets to make two good size drinks . 
this product is delicious ! it is the frappacino mix a lot of independent coffee shops use you will not be disappointed . 
big train decaf mocha blended coffee is so very , very good in my later years i find i do not tolerate caffine well and it has been hard to find a decaf to replace the coffee treats i have created for myself with caffine this is great makes a lot and will keep it in stock with auto reorder on amazon to save even more money and be certain i do not run out . 
this is a delicious oil the walnut flavor really stands out we keep this oil in the refrigerator , to preserve freshness and taste definitely shake it well before each use everyone comments on how good it tastes whenever we use it so , it 's pretty universal in its appeal br br we make a salad dressing using this walnut oil , blood orange vinegar and honey the ratio of all ingredients is 1 1 e g br 1 4 cup blood orange vinegar br 1 4 cup roasted walnut oil br 1 4 cup honey br \( adjust to your taste buds \) br mix with a blender or hand blender \( or by shaking the jar , but a blender mixes much better , especially with the thick honey \) wow , is this a wonderful salad dressing ! br br by the way , we use this blood orange vinegar cuisine perel blood orange vinegar , which is available via amazon it has a wonderful flavor . 
i make an extended butter using this oil , water and liquid lecithin it is just the best tasting spread ever and much healthier because of the walnut oil i keep mine refrigerated to preserve that wonderful taste and aroma it tends to settle out so be sure to shake it before using to get the full flavor and consistency i did n't know to do this on the first container and when i got to the bottom it was very thick , almost sludgy , with the roasted bits amazon 's price is pretty fair although i can occasionally find it locally \( tj maxx \) a bit cheaper but i must say ordering from amazon and getting it shipped straight to me is very convenient i 've never had any problems with damaged or leaking containers on this product \( well maybe a small dent in the metal but that 's all \) . 
i 've used la tourangelle roasted walnut oil during the barbeque season for the past four years or so it 's a great product and i wo n't fire up the hibachi without it along with various vinegars , i 'll splash it on mushrooms , peppers and whatever veggies i have from the garden \( the main dish is usually tofu , but i have a special marinade for that \) one 500 ml can lasts me about one season while the other two keep well in the refrigerator from what little shopping around i 've done i think the price would be hard to beat . 
flavor 5 stars first time i used the oil i poured some in a saute pan to scramble some eggs it ended up being an earthy mushroom like flavor i loved it i pour it on my dogs food occasionally and they love it i wanted to buy this originally because i watched the dr oz tv show and he recommended ingesting a little every day for its anti inflammatory properties i gave some oil to my aunt who has an auto immune disease and she likes the oil as well i would definitely buy this product again br br ding for metal alloy container it is cheap metal and though it was packaged well by amazon com the containers probably got dented in amazon 's warehouse because it did n't seem like the packaging should have caused the dents the way it was packaged if there was any damage it would probably only be dents to the containers so i would say expect dents with any shipment of oils if this company uses the same cheaper kind of metal alloy for their containers dents do not make the product taste worse so i do not worry about the taste i will return it if the containers leak but that would not stop me from ordering again however , the odds of leaking happening probably statistically is not often if you receive shipments regularly . 
la tourangelle roasted walnut is the best tasting oil i have ever had my old favorite was avocado oil but this is even better and keeps longer i pour it on everything make a great mayonnaise spinkle on baked stuffed shrimp or baked fish drizzled on steak or chicken and as a topping for pasta and bruschetta with some garlic , parsley and parmesan cheese addictive so you 'll want to have it in the house all the time buy it you will love it . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b001eq5ejq la tourangelle roasted walnut oil , 16 9 ounce cans \( pack of 3 \) a br i had already ordered this and had two left in my refrigerator , having given one to my brother he shared it with mutual friends , who loved it too , so i ordered another package for christmas gifts to those who had fallen in love with it after tasting his sharing i then used it \( 1 c \) in my peanut butter chocolate chip cookie recipe \( see review of skippy natural creamy pb \) this arrived today and i have to cheer ! br br thank you so much ! this product was securely and snuggly packaged in the perfect sized box so it did not slide about or damage itself ! thank you so much amz for giving due attention to appropriate and proper packaging to these three cans of walnut oil ! perfect ! \( yay ! \) br br it is lovely and so yummy that i also ordered a set of the pecan oil too br a href http www amazon com gp product b001po7fbw la tourangelle roasted pecan oil , 8 45 ounce tin a br br and , remember to check out the others pistachio , hazelnut , pumpkin , almond , etc br this is a great answer for those of us with non nut food allergies \( dairy , soy , gluten , lime , mint , grapes \) that allow us to use these oils to give some enchantment to our cooking and baking i subbed it for the peanut oil in my pb cookies and it added a nice note to them like christmas ! yumm ! br br remember , \( like so many other helpful reviewers advise \) to keep it in the refrig ! . 
wow i read the great feedback on this product and took the plunge and was not disappointed we had bought some other walnut oil at wf and this one blows that out of the water the flavor , aroma , and price are second to none br br my fav recipe so far br take a large yam sweet potatoe , cut in 1 4 inch strips lenthwise \( like a long potatoe chip \) baste in oil and salt broil for 10 min per side enjoy ! . 
in a feeling carefree moment at the grocery i purchased a can of this oil thinking to myself i would be tossing 7 in the trash later , but i was always curious about that little shiny metal can of walnut oil yesterday , i took the plunge and omgz is this oil awesome ! ! i put it to use in my pasta sauce , replacing the olive oil , and it was delicious ! the can says to refrigerate immediately after opening to preserve the oil , but i do not think its going to last very long before its empty . 
always a fan of la tourangelle oils , this time the hazelnut oil was received as a gift via amazon br br not only is the oil wonderful and delicate for salads , and some sauteeing , amazon now packages the cans to come dent free and protected br br great buy ! . 
i enjoy the flavor and use it for much of my cooking and add it as the oil to my home made granola it does not cook well on high heats \( as advertised \) , but does well at medium to low heat it 's health benefits far outweigh vegetable oil and canola oils i use both this and coconut oils whenever possible for flavor . 
the toasted flavor is so much better than regular walnut oil the price is the best i can find and we store it in the fridge for longer life . 
this is the good kind of fat , and tastes great br i actually like the taste better than butter it has a similar quality rich , indulgent , blends well with foods , and it is way healthier than butter not as aggressive tasting as olive oil br i have substituted it for butter every chance i get , with good results \( disclaimer i'm not much of a cook \) br br please buy this , so amazon will keep it in stock for me it costs much more in stores , and is hard to find . 
i almost ca n't put into words how much i love this product the packaging , the flavor , the health benefits , the price \( especially with the subscription discount \) fabulous ! the vinaigrette recipe on the can is phenomenal i mix up a couple of cups of it and keep it in a squeeze bottle in the fridge , use it on greens , antipasto , and grilled chicken i use the oil straight for the finishing touch on a lot of items recently i found myself with a last minute invitation to dinner and not a lot of ingredients in the house to throw together a contribution settled on a white bean bruscetta with a drizzle of this oil , and people swooned it elevates everything it touches . 
so happy i got this on a subscription i might even have to increase the frequency that it is delivered i 've used it in everything from scrambled eggs to brownies it 's not mild like olive oil , but it has enhanced the flavor of everything i 've cooked ! . 
i ordered a set of three cans and they showed up yesterday in perfect condition \( no dents \) so far i have made some boiled red potatoes and seasoned them with walnut oil and sea salt i also roasted some yukon gold potatoes and english squash with the oil and it turned out wonderful the walnut oil gives it a great flavor i will be giving one can to my parents since my mom is not a fan of olive oil it will give my dad a new flavor to play with in his cooking . 
the walnut oil is really good i later will often come to buy it i hope you will like it too . 
enjoyed the product , pleasant flavor , used it to in all my cooking , i will be purchasing it again cans were dented on arrival but did not harm the product . 
i had bought small cans previously and they arrived inadequately packaged , so they all had tiny dents these , however , arrived undented , well packaged in bubble wrap i have not yet opened them , but i have used the small cans this oil is great quality , and the price is not overblown recommended . 
we 've been using walnut oil for many years we brush it on toast to take the place of butter , eliminating much of the saturated fat from our diets it 's also wonderful in salads try it tossed into greens with a few nuts and chopped stone fruit or grapes , and a fruity vinegar this product is of excellent quality and amazon has a great price for it . 
the walnut oil has a wonderful taste to it i have used it in salads , salad dressing , couscous , and a variety of other things thank you for a wonderful product definately worth the money . 
this oil has a wonderful , mild , roasted walnut flavor that i found irresistible in a salad dressing \( it will now be my go to oil for homemade dressings \) there is a recipe for vinaigrette right on the back of the can bought it because it 's omega 3 content is second only to flaxseed oil , plus , it 's made in california ! br br definitely buy it on amazon , so much cheaper than the grocery store . 
we ordered this on our doctor 's recommendation and take a tablespoon every day as a supplement it 's supposed to have several omega acids also tasty on salads . 
walnut oil is an essential ingredient in our favorite waffle batter this oil is the best we 've used for the price great aroma ! ! ! . 
great product and priced well , we 've ordered this several times over the past few years and really like their walnut oil , packaged well and ships on time , will keep ordering this product from the same seller . 
i love the walnut oil it came in cans which i like a lot because you hardly see them any more the walnut oil was better quality than any of the walnut oil i bought in my neighbourhood and cheaper even with the shipping charge i recommend it to anyone . 
la tourangelle makes some really good oils i like this company alot try the sesame oil too . 
what a fresh smell and a very pleasant taste br it , s very good for you too i use it in place of olive oil , for salads and cooking . 
one of my favorite salad recipes i make often calls for walnut oil i bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over 10 for about 6 ounces steep ! i love walnuts so naturally i loved this oil from my very first taste but the price was not right so i searched on the internet and found this i was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as i thought they go rancid before i can finish but i am now on my last can i use it in place of evoo to make other vinaigrettes too or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and b s \( or seasons salt like krazy salt \) over spring mix , it is an easy but great green salad ! i do this a lot when i need a quick side anyway , this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty just a touch of nice walnut flavor \( of course , i love walnuts so even if it tastes very walnutty , i would still like it ! \) br br anyway , it is a great product and i will buy the same pack again ! . 
this is a great oil for baking it gives a nutty flavor it also works great in dressings much better than olive oil . 
i enjoyed the carbonation with a hint of blackberry and liked the fact there are no calories or artificial sweeteners . 
this product helped us tremendously when our 2 year old daughter started day care , she would n't eat at the center and she began losing weight we started her on pediasure in the mornings as an insurance policy that she was getting enough nutrion it worked great she stopped losing weight and actually started gaining \) she loves the taste , especially the strawberry flavor . 
this is awesome ! it really helped my daughter gain the much needed weight for a reasonable price will do business again \) . 
glad to find this for a birthday present as hard to find decaf ones in store br br makes good ice slushy and milk sakes cold br br for those who can not take decaf , these are , and making them at home sure beats starbucks prices . 
this coffee mix is so easy to make and taste great i enjoy all their flavors as my kids do too hard to keep around buying a box of it at a time helps . 
strong , dark , intense strong enough for a man but mellow enough for a woman it really is a good coffee with no bitter after taste i just love it it 's good with cream and sweetner with no watered down taste or just plain wish they made a decaf then i could drink it 24 7 . 
if anyone is looking for delicious and healthy snack , doctor kracker is an answer however , the hard crispiness is for people with good teeth . 
these flatbreads are definitely my favorite cracker , but they 're messy when i break them apart to have something closer to bite sized br br caution despite the description that they are made with spelt and good for people with wheat issues , people with celiac disesase cannot eat these spelt has gluten and the flatbreads contain barley malt i love them and heartily recommend them , but please do n't misunderstand the nature of spelt and accidentally serve them to someone with gluten intolerance br br oh , yes , great price at amazon compared to my local grocery store i hope that advantage continues . 
with all the meds i take , i have a lot of problems with my stomach i try a cracker first , when nausea hits , with gaviscon or tums being the next up to bat if that does n't work br br these are so wonderfully yummy that i then bought the pumpkin seed cheddar too ! the flatbread is great alone , or used instead of bread the crunch is intense , although i love it that way i keep these next to my chair and next to my bed and look forward to trying other flavors too . 
have tried many crackers , including some other dr kracker , and think this tastes the best it 's hard crunchy with lots of seeds on it , so if that 's an issue , it might not be for everyone buying it in amazon 's 6 pack makes it less expensive than purchasing in the store . 
i eat them just like this ! i like something with substance to it , and when you eat these , you know you 're eating something they 're healthy , taste good , and are reasonably priced . 
this is one of the best dried organic crackers around highly recommend them compared to other available types of similar products . 
could not stop eating these after the first taste ! high quality ingredients make a big difference love the crunch and the seeds the subtle sweetness is nice too , much less heavy handed than in most products . 
love these crackers and all of the dr kracker products i use subscribe and save to save a little bit of money and to insure that i do n't run out i pretty much eat one every day instead of bread my current favorite topping is goat cheese ! . 
i like these crackers so much i just ordered a different flavor these are very crunchy and satisfying i put two crackers into a zip lock baggie break them into bite sized pieces and this is my treat throughout the day and into the evening and they are very filling i do recommend them however i do n't know how well they 'd go over for those with dentures because they are so crisp and because they have seeds of various sizes very good find love um . 
i am always on the lookout for healthy but tasty foods that are low in calories these crackers are good , not in a omg type of good , but they have an interesting yet addictive taste that i ca n't really explain i would definately recommend them everyone i give them to keeps asking me for more i guess i should stop sharing . 
these are delicious and filling i first had them in hawaii a few weeks ago but then could n't find them when i got back home to philly amazon had them and a good selection if you are a seed and nut eater and like a crispy cracker you will love these enjoy ! . 
thanks to the wonderful reviews i read about this crispbread , i decided to purchase there are many other crispbreads crackers that i 've purchased that taste like cardboard and have little flavor i think this crispbread is really delicious a little sweet with lots of crunch and a variety of seeds great flavor i like that it 's organic , whole grain , and relatively high in protein it 's a little different from other crackers and it is great topped with egg or tuna salad or all by itself delicious ! i will have to try some of the other doctor kracker crispbreads i will certainly be ordering more of these . 
these are the only crackers that i buy so healthy and so good eat them with a salad and you have the perfect lunch . 
these crackers are a great healthy snack without anything spread on them my only dislike is that they are a tad too sweet for me i 'd like them without the molasses . 
outstanding product i am always going to have them around far and above most crackers for taste and good nutrition . 
each of these flatbread crackers has 4 grams of protein , 3 grams of fiber , and only 100 calories , so they 're substantive and filling by themselves however , because they 're so firm and sturdy , they make a good base for more complex snacks br br one very simple addition is to sprinkle shredded cheese on top of a cracker and microwave it until the cheese melts \( 15 seconds \) you could even stack another cracker on top before microwaving to make a tightly bonded cheese and flatbread sandwich br br just about any recipe you would normally make on top of a cracker or on top of a piece of toast can work here . 
this flatbread is just delicious i love all the various seeds , very crunchy there is a hint of sweet but in a delicious way . 
i love these flatbreads i smear mascarpone on them and then so many diffferent things on top of that to make a wonderful snack or lite meal their very crunchy and tasty i watch my diet closely since i have diabetes and these crackers are very low in net carbs in addition to tasting good the other flavors are good too i 've twice now had to move up their delivery since i go thru them quick you 'll love em and will have fun trying different toppings for them i really like them with lox , mascarpone cream cheese and dr kracker do n't forget the capers . 
this is an excellent product it is healthy , delicious , has a great texture and feel in your mouth and goes perfectly with hummus or other spreads ! . 
just tried the doctor kracker seedlander crackers today and they are delicious ! i'm going to try their other flavors soon ca n't believe how good these are . 
the first moment you bite into this cracker , you will notice the difference this tasty , crunchy , organic cracker is perfect with soup or salad it is certified organic , using quality ingredients the cracker is dry , not greasy or oily like a typical potato chip br br comes in several different varieties and flavors br br recommended . 
these are wonderful ! so crunchy and they 're made from whole spelt as well as seeds and a big helping of tasty br br i found them remarkably filling too they 're nice and big it would be easy to make these the basis for a light meal adding just a few toppings br br i ordered these sight unseen and never tasted so i had no preconceived notions i'm very pleased and will order these again . 
these crackers rock wish company would let you buy assortment since you have to buy minimum of 6 boxes at a time . 
these are excellent snack crackers , but you need a really good set of teeth to bite into them ! we have eaten them plain but they are probably excellent with cheese also the interesting thing is that once you manage to bite a piece off they are not hard to chew ! br br chock full of healthy seeds , these are great for either a snack or to accompany a bowl of soup or a salad . 
i subscribe to these now switch around to the different flavors sometimes high in fiber and trace minerals , i mostly eat these with diffeent flavors of sardines \( kippers \) , tuna , and anything else that would go good with any other crackers this is part of my change to a healthier diet , that i started about 6 years ago , now at age fifty my blood pressure cholesteral are the best they have ever been my dentist has even stated my gums are looking healthier \( no more bleeding gums \) a first for me on line with the teeth issue , these probably are to hard for those with loose or weak teeth but if you want a decently tasty cracker , to replace bad snacking habits , their probably is n't anything better i first came across these at jason 's deli , so i googled them and read reviews as you are doing now if you are not sure if you will like them try getting them at your local deli they usually have a couple of flavors and are the smaller cracker not flatbread , but taste the same also over the years i have modified what i eat , first i started as a lo carber , mostly eating my favorite meats etc , but my triglicerides were always high , so i started adding sardines more nuts fruits , skipping more often some of my favorites like fried chicken but have found excellent flavorful alternatives , dark chocolate almonds , some sara lee breads , lo carb brands of tortillas i still fall off once in a while eat out often , but always get back on course i feel better and healthier actually enjoy look forward to eating all the varieties of foods i 've painstakingly researched over the years which i keep on hand , so as not to eat bad too often . 
these are the best crackers i 've ever eaten two crackers spread with cheese feel like a meal to my belly i spread them with aged bleu cheese , omg good ! why have i never tried or even seen these before \? . 
this is the only oatmeal that my family will even consider eating i make it in the crock pot overnight and it is always ready when we are i use my small crock pot for the two of us i start with a 1 2 cup of oatmeal add a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla add a 1 2 cup of milk and 2 cups cold water place the lid on the crock pot and plug it in it will be ready in the morning when you are i let mine cook approx 10 hours my small crock pot has no settings just off or on we love to add some brown sugar and dried blueberries or craisins at the table . 
i make a bowl of mccann 's every morning in the little crockpot for my breakfast add a banana , and it 's perfect ! ! try it and you 'll never eat 'the other stuff' again ! ! . 
i 'll be honest , if you want a quick breakfast do n't purchase this oatmeal but , if you have time to spare or do n't mind waiting for some good eats , this is the oatmeal for you br br step 1 pour some milk into a sauce pan step 2 add a dash of salt or salt to taste step 3 add oatmeal , making sure it stays covered by milk step 4 turn on stove to low heat not too low but definitely not too high , as you do n't want the milk to evaporate dry out leaving you with tough oats in pan and cover pan step 5 do some little cleaning to built up appetite making sure to ck on progress periodically step 6 add more milk if oats are still too tough and let it simmer for a little while longer step 7 get your ladle just pour directing into a bowl add a few raisins cranberries your favorite dried fruit and enjoy ! . 
purchased case of 6 cans from amazon com for bucks including shipping br good quality slow cooking oatmeal good shelf life on cans this is the slow cooking type 20 40 minutes depending on preference taste is good . 
my daughter and i eat low carb which oatmeal is not really , by the way but i was looking for something that we could eat in the morning that was not meat dairy egg , and was gluten free , and filling , without being pure sugar like most breakfast foods and especially grains i decided to try these long cooking irish oats we use 2 cups water and 1 2 cup dry oats , for 1 4cup dry each it takes this stuff 30 minutes to cook so it is not fast food , for sure but strangely enough , it 's filling adding fats \( couple tablespoons of cream \) to the serving helps that of course in any case , it is much tastier , and much more long lasting for keeping us satisfied , than i expected , and surprisingly stable on blood sugar nor has it set off cravings like most grains , fruits , etc do if we eat those the sugars digest so slowly in this apparently it is more solid and nutty than the flakey quick oats i grew up with , which i now consider a gummy gluey sugarbomb insult to true oats these are harder to find and cost more but they 're worth it . 
perhaps some of you are like i was wanting to take advantage of the health benefits of oatmeal , but uncertain how to prepare it so that you and your family will actually eat it after experimenting a bit , and reading lots of recipes , i 've come up with a simple , yet tasty way to prepare mccann 's steel cut irish oatmeal give it a try , and you may decide that oatmeal can be a healthy and delicious addition to your breakfast menu br br recipe br br start by bringing 3 cups of water to a boil \( about 3 minutes in the microwave \) br in a medium saucepot , melt 1 tablespoon of butter then add 1 cup of oats toast the oats on medium heat for about 3 minutes br add the boiling water to the toasted oats and simmer for 25 minutes do n't stir it should get to a soft bubbling simmer br if it boils to hard , you stove is set too hot , so turn it down or it will burn br add 1 cup of milk \( or can do with a mix of milk and buttermilk \) br cook an additional 10 minutes , stirring occasionally br br makes 4 5 good size servings with excellent texture and consistency it thickens once it sits a little bit you can increase or decrease the milk to adjust the consistency as desired you can also save it for up to a week in the refrigerator without much difference in taste just store in small sealed bowls each can of mccanns oatmeal makes about 16 20 servings br br everyone likes to top and sweeten their oatmeal differently \( sugar , brown sugar , maple syrup , raisins , etc \) only add the toppings when you 're ready to eat it , not before storing in the refrigerator for my serving , i like to add 2 tsp of brown sugar , a sprinkle of cinnamon , about 1 2 tbsp of butter , and then top with chopped pecans very tasty hope you enjoy ! br br please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful . 
i like it , it reminds me of food from my childhood not something i 'd eat everyday kinda like the way i feel about grits you need to cook them for a long time how you serve them makes all the difference in the world great for baking , but you have to know the product before you try baking with it taste \? real wholesome , good stick to your ribs food , takes some effort like granola healthy eating \? yes . 
if you follow the cooking directions , in my opinion , you have wallpaper paste cut the cooking time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes , and it is much better a little chewy , but that 's how i like it ! breakfast takes more planning now , since it 's a longer cooking time than my old brand but good taste and worth it . 
we were introduced to mccann 's oatmeal a few years ago by close friends we were able to find it locally in a few stores near where we live however the these few stores gradually became fewer until the product was no longer available to us this left us with the internet as the only option for obtaining this product hopefully this resource will not fade away br br joyce . 
very satisfied with this product excellent flavor and texture recomment for those looking for good breakfast choice . 
delighted with my first ever irish oats steel cut as a diabetic this should help me with my blood sugar natural carb with a slow release ! br br cook up a batch in the slow cooker and use left overs \( microwave \) for a couple of days great will be purchasing more br br thanks mccann 's and amazon . 
i have been having quaker oatmeal for yesrs until trying this today ! the texture and the taste are completely different from the pressed oat it worths cooking for half hour my son love it at the first bite ! my 8 month old baby is also love it ! i uaually cook the portion which will be enough for 2 3 days drop one spoon or two into the worm milk every morning to make my breakfast much more healthier ! this one is so good that it will be hard for me to go back to pressed oatmeal . 
i really like this product to add to water so that i do n't have to drink so much gatorade and sweetened acidic beverages i use this because i have very low sodium levels and my doctors do not want me drinking free water br br the only complaint i have is that it did n't arrive when promised and i did n't have it in time to take with me on vacation . 
i ordered these for my upcoming wedding candy buffet i am doing all navy and white and these go perfectly they are individually wrapped and a true navy color the packaging was great each lollipop is wrapped in bubble wrap love them ! . 
these lollipops are are well done , look exactly like the picture not a single one was broken ! they packaged each lollipop so nicely , very impressed ! . 
perfect ! these are great vintage looking lollipops for our vintage wedding good quality pic on amazon selling page is what you get . 
about ten years ago my wife and i stayed at a small resort near domenical , costa rica lizano was on every table in the restaurant we were quickly hooked lizano goes great with eggs , beans , rice , tortillas , pork , fish , etc it 's really tasty and nothing taco sauce or steak sauce we 're on our second case now give it a try . 
about twenty years ago , i visited costa rico , and on my very first night , i stopped at a small restaurant , and ended up eating what is the typical dish rice , with some vegetables mixed in , also some chicken the chicken and veggies are chopped up into small pieces , and all of it is cooked in a pan , and served warm it is really good , but what really makes it is the salsa lizano , which used to be on every table in costa rico , now you may have to ask for it , as it is really popular this salsa is great on cabbage , chicken , rice dishes , just about anything i always made a point of bring a bottle or two home with me , as it was not possible to purchase anywhere in america br br trust me , try some of this stuff , you will not regret it also , it is not what i would consider a hot sauce sure it has a little heat , but very mild . 
yes i read the other reviews and given the review dates and my other experiences with earth 's best i was not too concerned that the problems mentioned would still be an issue and they were not br br we have tried almost all of the gourmet line of earth 's best and these are great for adding protein to your little one 's \( lo \) diet google the earth best 's website for complete nutrition info most 2nd stage food have between 2 and 3 grams of protein a serving this one has 5grams of protein and only 2 grams of sugars our lo likes the taste and we like the ingridients and nutrition profile recommended . 
organic , and loaded with calories , fat and protein , this the only baby food with meat that my picky little one will happily eat i 've found that very few groceries carry this near my home \( and i live in metropolitan seattle \) and so i 've resorted to ordering it by the case from amazon the free 2 day shipping rocks ! . 
this jar of baby food has 7 grams of fat and 110 calories thats triple the fat and double the calories of most baby food ! i highly recommend for babies needing to put on some lbs as well as picky eaters i have to offer my son a variety of 7 8 foods each meal \( cheese , avacado , chunks of meat etc \) b c he turns up his nose at so much \( and i ca n't just say 'well too bad' b c he desperately needs the calories ! \) but this is one of the foods he rarely turns down i highly recommend . 
i wondered why my 10 month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews were n't so promising then i noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids br br here 's the ingredient list water , organic carrots , organic mango puree , organic finely ground chicken , organic whole grain brown rice flour , organic yellow split pea flakes , calcium carbonate br br anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet , and this one is sweet the consistency seemed very normal , perhaps because it has plenty of water that 's the first ingredient unlike most earth best flavor brands , this one has calcium the stated amount is 35 of their daily needs i 've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult br br i recommend this particular one , chicken mango risotto , because i think babies will tend to like it as mine did br br these cases are being delivered to my home constantly , different varieties of earth 's best subscriptions on occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars over time i figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars , i report it and can get credited for the broken ones only of course it 's messy when a jar is broken , but i do n't have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price . 
the other reviews are very outdated old we never had any issues with the quality of this product my daughter loved it i loved the fact that she was getting good protein most of the other earth 's best baby foods have carrot squash sweet potatoes , which is fine , however my daughter was turning orange from so many orange veggies i liked that this one had no orange veggies in the ingredient list slightly more expensive than other meals , which i think is due to the fact it has a lot of meat in it . 
if baby likes that 's what matters ! happy baby ! happy mommy ! only thing is the color of food that stain anything , but , oh , well , just washed right the way ! . 
my 7 mo old despises all things fruit related \( we think it 's too sweet for her \) yet she likes this one just fine ! i'm perplexed that so many other reviewers say their baby hates it , although i must admit i have n't tasted it myself for us it 's a tasty way to get her to eat a little more fruit every day . 
i purchased this product from b r us when it was on sale and my son seems to like it i was scared of previous post of mold and i always double check the food before i stir and serve he seems to like it , but i recommend the chicken sweet potato dinner . 
let me start by saying my 7 month old son , who is used to my home prepared baby foods loves this , as a once in a blue moon convenience meal ! i 've tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too rare in the baby food industry br br i am following a weaning guide that i used for my daughter , and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland , watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made , healthy meals , resulting in picky toddlers and children my daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet , and i attribute that to the hard work i put in in the first year another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs are n't fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger br br i 'd love to ask , who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets , though \? my son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much fuller , so i 've had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume and it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water , so i add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little before long , i'm sure he 'll just be on 2 full 4oz jars when i give him this br br all that said , i 'll reiterate , it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food , and i have no problem giving it to my son once in a while i do recommend ! . 
the earth 's best 'grourmet' line is heavy on the protein and as far as i know adequate protein is important for babies and they need , like the rest of us , good iron levels br br the beef and spinach contains 5 grams per serving you can check your cans , but most of the other 's we use the protein is 2 grams our daughter likes it it is also the least expensive of the 'gourmet' line and this is not something i could find in local stores recommended . 
my picky eater loves this flavor each jar is 110 calories 5 grams of fat so this momma loves this flavor as well i'm ordering more because it 's the one flavor \( besides green beans \) that i know my son will eat . 
this is a terrific baby food it has beef and spinach and tastes great ! it was the first meat baby food my son would eat i tasted it myself and it 's quite good . 
my baby is 8 months and i purchased the gourmet meals pack she really liked this one best out of all of them . 
my daughter loves this ! she is picky so she does n't always eat as many healthy foods as she should this flavor gives her the vegetables and protein that she needs it is a little bit grainier than other stage 2 foods but still very usable for babies over 6 months . 
i have never had a problem with anything from amazon i have ordered about 30 cases of earth 's best baby food this is the most tasty and nutritious variety they offer 5 grams of protein , and 15 iron ! i have it on my subscribe and save he ca n't get enough of this , he eats it everyday ! . 
we live in the middle of nowhere so we end up ordering a lot of spices etc that ca n't be found locally this gives great chipotle taste with just a little sprinkled on i'm going to order a few more of these because i never want to run out of it . 
the breeder of my puppy uses this , and i continued to feed with this supplement dog loves the taste , and makes her boring dry food more interesting she gobbles it up i notice her coat is beautiful good ingredients i would recommend this . 
my dogs love these and even my allergy dogs can eat them too ! ! br thanks for have these on your site again 5 stars ! and paws up for old mother hubbard wellness treats br thanks br pepper love . 
old mother hubbard biscuits \( we 've tried these as well as the puppy variety \) are the only true biscuits my dogs like ! they would eat the whole bag if i let them the only thing i do n't like is they contain wheat , but as long as your dog does n't have a wheat allergy , it 's no big deal i would definitely recommend them . 
use these as treats for my five labs use only this type as they contain the ingredients i am looking for and are a great size for labs ordered them for years dogs love them . 
i'm not much of a chocolate and peanut butter person , but these chocolates are the perfect combination of both the different flavors have definitely made me a fan . 
bought this for my chocolate lover boyfriend and he loved it ! he shared it with me and they were delicious thank you ! . 
some of the best chocolates i ever tasted if you are a chocolates lover then you have to try these . 
you can taste the quality and care that goes into these chocolates great flavor , i highly recommend it you have to try for yourself ! . 
i never drank coffee in my life received a gift of ghiradelli chocolate flavored coffee for christmas searched on line and found this dark chocolate decadence it is the absolute best have it on bi monthly subscription order now with amazon if you are a fan of dark chocolate this is a wonderful coffee very smooth with just a hint a dark chocolate in the background delicious sweetened with honey and milk also divine with almond milk or vanilla soy milk coffee masters make wonderful coffee . 
i love that i can get both flavors in one container and at the asians store around where i'm at they go for about a buck , sometimes more so this is definitely a good deal and even cheaper when you subscribe and save . 
same stable and good quality of meiji yan yan when i got the good deal from amazon com , the price is even better than those available in local asian store , which is really rare . 
i bought these for my son 's 12th birthday party favor goodie bag it 's hard to put together a goodie bag for 12 year old boys , but this is something that everyone likes ! . 
it 's exactly what i wanted it 's yummy make sure you eat your chocolate dip before the strawberry , because you wo n't like it the other way around it 's perfect . 
this mix is easy to prepare and very tasty the only prep work consists of cutting up a zucchini which takes less than a minute the seasoning is excellent , very flavorful but not too spicy sometimes low salt mixes are spiced up with a lot of pepper but not this one excellent for vegetarians . 
my dog loves this flavor quality of cookie overall is very good this particular smell drives him crazy ! ! on amazon i get much chipper than in a store . 
dogs love them and they are made the best way , they are about 4 00 cheaper that the pet stores and no tax . 
old mother hubbard treats are the best and at a reasonable price their treats come in a lot of different sizes and flavors they offer a variety of products that all dogs will love my three black labs love the peanut butter and bac'n cheez . 
we live an hour away from any stores that would carry this product so it 's easier and cheaper than making the trip . 
the first batch i got must have been a bad batch , because it seemed to have a burned coffee smell , and smelled a bit more like chocolate raspberry or some other flavor rather than pure chocolate it made me wonder whether coffee masters uses the same equipment to make both a chocolate raspberry flavor and the dark chocolate decadence flavor , and if the flavors got mixed during the manufacturing process br br since then , i have ordered it several more times and have been more satisfied with it there are times , however , when those burned flavor notes creep back in , depending on the bag i sometimes wonder if coffee masters overroasts their beans br br i originally bought this coffee instead of the chocolate coffee i used to regularly enjoy but could not find on amazon , brothers gourmet coffee chocolate swirl the coffee masters dark chocolate decadence bean is darker , oilier , and richer than the brothers bean the brothers bean coffee is milder , more like swiss chocolate br br i still might prefer the medium bean brothers blend over this coffee , even though it is a medium bean and not a dark bean , as the flavor profile tastes more like real chocolate br br update i am now actively seeking out coffees that are fair trade or direct trade or advertise ethical practices those that ignore the plight of the farmer and show no transparency in the process of the coffee from field to table i do not buy any longer so this brand is no longer one that i will purchase plus they engage in farming activities that are not ecologically sound i suggest starting with intelligentsia . 
sounds corny but oh so true the aroma is pungent with the savory smell of coffee and the sweetness of chocolate the chocolate flavor is rich yet delicate so it does n't overwhelm i purchased four bags of the ground coffee first for my daughter she insisted i taste it even tho i do n't like flavored coffee or 'dark' chocolate i enjoyed it so much i took back a bag and purchased 4 bags of the whole beans to grind when needed for that added freshness while i will not drink flavored coffee all the time , i feel it 's a treat to start or end my day with a cup of this delicious coffee my daughter also enjoys this coffee cold . 
we like to mix this with regular coffee because it 's so strong and rich by itself that it makes it go further and is n't too overpowering . 
another great hit from coffee masters ! this one has a rich , dark chocolate flavor that 's not too intense but just right the coffee is foll bodied and very smooth i will definitely order more from amazon . 
i have really fallen for flavored coffees and i consider these to be some of the best so much so that i'm on the regular shipment list now i'm sure i drink too much of this but i love the flavors try it , i'm sure you 'll like it . 
we really like this coffee , it has great flavor and we make it strong we do the subscribe thing and it works out about right . 
this like yummy homemade hot cocoa , with the benefit of being a delicious cup of coffee , too ! this is a great deal ! get it while it lasts ! good to the last drop , you could say ! br enjoy ! . 
my female pixie bob cat , pawnee , is extremely finicky about her canned food she will touch nothing but instinct 's rabbit formula , and licks her plate clean each morning the instinct brand is nothing but the best , whether it is a canned formula or dry . 
this is a great food and my cat loves it ! the only thing that seems a bit strange to me is the difference in consistency between batches , and even the difference in consistency between the 3 ounce cans and the 5 ounce cans seriously , it looks like a different food , with the 3 ounce cans looking much smoother in texture , and the 5 ounce cans looking much more grainy i hope that the following review will help someone with a cat that has stomach issues similar to mine br br i have tried many , many products aimed at helping with digestive upset for my cat her pain and suffering was so great that i thought i was going to have to put her to sleep i went to multiple vets and had thousands of dollars worth of diagnostics done to try and find out why she was having acid reflux , crying and subsequently vomitting \( endoscopy , xray , ultrasound , bloodwork , etc \) one vet told me to just give her pepcid this worked for a while , but then became completely ineffective after a while the same vet then told me that she probably just has food allergies and would have to be on steroids for the rest of her life , and thats all that could be done , and prescribed different kinds of science diet \( which we all know is actually a terrible food for cats with digestive problems \) br br well , what do you know , the steroids did n't help at all i tried probiotics of various brands for pets , i tried digestive enzymes , i tried many different natural products designed to help ease digestive intestinal inflammation i tried a homiopathic vet \( the only one in my area \) and spent a few thousand more dollars rerunning tests and running other tests for pancreatitis , etc i tried making her food from raw meat to try and eliminate food allergies to commericial foods as a potential problem , etc i tried everything , but still my cat was constantly licking her lips , then crying in terrible pain and vomitting very consistently , and now was losing interest in her food and was losing weight and starting to look boney i was determined to not give up on her though i had just lost my wife to infection during a failed bone marrow transplant cancer during all this , and was not about to give up on my girl br br i stopped making her food and started getting her natures variety canned rabbit formula and the duck formula she loved the food but it did not seem to be helping her feel all that much better , even though a lot of other people were having great success i then found a site called wellvet dot com that said that the ulcinex was very effective at repairing ulcers and the stomach lining in pets it also said that it was very effective at controlling vomitting that occurs a few hours after eating , which is exactly what was consistently happening , and no other product that i had found so far claimed to do same thing i was skeptical as soon as it started talking about chinese herbs and such , but i figured it was worth a shot br br i started giving this as prescribed from wellvet along with georges aloe vera juice \( the one without preservatives and no taste \) , which is said to help a lot for acid reflux sufferers \( i found a few people that said it worked great for their cats \) , and continuing the rabbit duck formula all the while praying , within a few days i started noticing a drastic improvement she was licking her lips less , and was able to relax for longer periods of time without jumping up in pain and crying she vommitted once within a several day period several days later , no more crying , and instead of hiding behind the bedroom door licking her lips the whole night , she started sleeping with me at night like she used to now , several weeks later , she is literally 90 better no more vomitting at all , is in very little pain , very little lip licking and only very occasionally at that she also gets much more rest , and has put on several pounds and is back above her normal weight and has a nice chubby belly my cat suffered daily for 2 long years during this whole process before i found this and the other two mentioned products the aloe vera juice on its own did n't seem to completely do the trick , so i think its the combination of the three things that is really effective i only hope that no permanent damage has already been done , but now i have my cat back and do n't have to suffer through losing a great wife and a great cat if you have a cat with severe stomach issues , you owe it to yourself and your cat to try this along with the georges aloe vera and ulcinex br br a href http www amazon com gp product b0006iicom metagenics ulcinex 90 tablets a br br a href http www amazon com gp product b000qv9ta0 warren laboratories george 's aloe vera , 64 fl oz liquid a . 
i was at my wits end with hypoallergenic foods for my cat with ibd this one is one he will finally eat , and even ask for nothing is more heartrending than trying to get a sick cat to eat , and putting expensive prescription food down to have him sniff , walk away , and cry for food i was so relieved when i found this my cat is now maintaining i pray they continue to make it for years to come ! . 
we tried all flavors for our cats and the rabbit was the apparent favorite for all of them took a recommendation from catinfo org for this food as it is closest to the diet that a cat would naturally eat coats are softer and glossy energy levels seem to be up quite pleased with the results so far . 
a few years ago , my cat was diagnosed with food allergies that previously undiagnosed had led to ibd and then pancreatitis we went through just about every limited ingredient food to find one he would eat consistently he finally settled on nature 's variety instinct lamb and rabbit he 'll eat every time and all the time duck and venison , he 'll also eat just not always br br he still suffers from ibd and will have pancreatitis flare ups if given chicken , but his coat is soft and shiny he 's active \( at 13 yrs old \) and he rarely throws up i could n't survive , he could n't survive , without this food br br i'm glad the company finally started to make 3 oz cans mr picky does n't does n't like leftovers it does n't hurt as much to toss out 1 5 oz as it does 4 oz . 
i have been finding quality food for one of my kitties who has developed an allergy to chicken i hesitated on this brand because of the price , but then when i saw how limited my choices were i broke down and ordered a few of the flavors i have to say i am very pleased with the quality i also ordered some evo venison and duck as well as the natural balance limited ingredients venison with peas and the duck with peas neither of those compare to this brand and my cats testify to that as well as i do the texture is so much better and she loves these the most i have gotten her the rabbit , duck and venison and she eats them all with more relish that either evo or natural balance i do have to say that of those lesser brands , the natural balance venison does have a nice texture and not as pasty as the duck with peas mabel was n't as crazy about it though , although she did eat it all but not with the same excitement as the instinct brand when you are having a problem with a cat that can not or will not eat something , when you find something she will , it is worth it 's weight in gold ! this brand is a keeper . 
why is it so hard to find rabbit based cat food \? \? br br i like to give my cat variety in his diet his main foods are mostly poultry , but i like to keep the fish and red meat to a minimum after my last cat was diagnosed with diabetes i did a lot of in depth research on feline diets one veterinarian who 's written extensively about homemade cat foods was fond of using rabbit as a poultry alternative because it 's closest to what a small cat would eat in the wild it 's particularly excellent to supplement a diet when the cat is sensitive to fish \( as many are \) it 's also higher in fat than fish many fish based foods i looked at only took 15 to 20 of their calories from fat , and a cat needs more than that br br this food fits the bill ! it 's got an excellent ingredient list it 's grain free , which is what i consider to be the most important qualification , and does n't contain animal meal or by products br br there are three reasons i'm giving it four stars instead of five first , it 's expensive rabbit meat , by weight , is going to be pricey , so i'm not surprised but just because i think it 's worth the price does n't mean i would n't like to pay less ! second , my cat is n't crazy about it it 's got a ground texture and he 's very fussy about only eating shredded meat i solved this by mixing a 3 oz can of this food with a 3 oz can of shredded chicken \( of a different brand \) and he gobbled it up i just wish i did n't have to take that extra step finally , it 's awfully dry it was actually a surprise the meat itself is very dry , and the liquid in the can is totally separated i think most cat foods use thickeners so that the gravy clings to the meat , and this one does n't since one of the many advantages of canned food is that it helps to keep the cat hydrated they have a low thirst drive and are built to take in much of their fluids with their food i was a bit disappointed and surprised the first time i tipped what looked like a can full of meat too far to the side and ended up with watery cat food juice on my hand and the kitchen floor ! but this was also solved by mixing it with a chicken in gravy food br br those complaints are n't enough to keep me from buying this food , though it 's still a great cat food with a hard to find protein source and a good ingredient list it 's a bit expensive for me to use as a main food , but a can or two a week gives just the right amount of variety . 
one of my cats developed a food allergy and was throwing up anything he ate there are many types of food that the vet recommended trying \( duck , venison , etc \) but he refused to eat any of those br br then we found this food , and all is good again br br thank goodness there 's something he will deign to eat that wo n't aggravate his food allergies ! . 
the vet recommended rabbit based food for my cat , and that is difficult to find she seems to be allergic to chicken and the regular cat food menu unfortunately , she 's not crazy about this food , but that 's just because she 's a spoiled brat cat . 
just kind of yeast shopping one day you 're at the store and thinking , man , i really need to get me some new yeast this sounded intriguing an alt strain , clean and rapid fermentation tolerant of cold conditions in short , it is a hard working and industrious yeast that does its job without much fanfare and it cleans up after itself only the germans would have such a yeast it 's not like the california yeasts that are kind of fruity , or the british yeasts that just leave a mess it 's very german br br you could easily pass this off as a lager yeast i did a very simple wheat pale malt light ale 1 032 og 1 008 fg fermented at about 60 62 give or take grain to bottle in a week i was n't too concerned with flocculation or haze but that 's just me cracked on the other day just to get a taste extremely clean you can taste every single grain of the malt i did n't hop it much maybe 15 ibu tops with magnum very nice lawnmower or pounding beer br br blow off tube is mandatory next project is a 1 062 american wheat blew out the airlock i had 5 gallons in a 6 gallon carboy and it wanted enough space for 10 gallons very vigorous br br if you want an absolutely crisp , clean yeast that produces very lager like beers and can tolerate temps down to about 55 , this is it seems to really accentuate malt very nice yeast , but i like a little yeast profile so i do n't know if i'm in love with it just impressed at how clean it is . 
so let 's be honest i have severe anxiety and depression issues which has gone on my whole life i have been prescribed dozens of different meds to help with it but nothing has also , i do n't have insurance so i literally put out hundreds a month to try new drugs that did n't help more importantly , the side effects were sometimes as bad or worse than my symptoms i have also tried other natural cures that did n't help br br several of my friends suggested i smoke hemp as a natural cure i'm not against it but i'm not a smoker and i 've had professional jobs where i could be tested , anyway so i thought , let 's check amazon and see what natural hemp products are available br br first i tried hemp powder , which i also reviewed if you 're interested , and it tasted like sand it will take me all year to be able to finish the 3 lb bag and that 's if i ever do then i tried this br br i'm very honest in my reviews so i would n't recommend this if it did n't truly help it 's not a placebo effect thing , either i have tried too many meds for that to even be a possibility , trust me br br the one thing i can tell you for certain is within the first week it greatly and noticeably increased my energy levels i have done more around the house in the past few months than i 've done in the past few years i have gone through 2 subscriptions of this and the energy has n't gone away i am a big and tall person so i take 4 in the morning and 4 at night , usually br br anyone who has depression anxiety issues knows that sometimes you barely feel like getting out of bed most days you get a heavy feeling like there 's lead in your veins if you 've been through it then you understand what i'm talking about br br i can say with 100 honesty that it has given me way more energy and it has helped with that heavy feeling can i guarantee it will work \? no my aunt and mom tried a couple just one time and they did n't notice any difference but it has sure worked for me taking it daily what i can tell you is that you should at least try it if it does n't help , just do n't buy it again but it is sure worth a try because it might help you as much as it has me i will take this supplement for the rest of my life , as far as i'm concerned that 's how much it has helped br br i hope it works for you , too . 
this hemp oil is excellent stuff for real , if you are using fish oil , this actually has more omega 3 's and has many other medicinal values br combine this with hemp seeds \( in smoothies \) and you will notice a difference in any aches in your knees and your hair will shine and your body will be filled with antioxidants br anything hemp rocks you will not be disappointed in this product and it came on time and was packaged well \( 3 \) bottles for this price is a great value . 
the capsules are easy for my wife to take , they really help her crohn 's disease after reviewing and reasearching we found that hemp seed oil helps crohn 's disease she has tried all the prescription meds which if you read the after affects on them they are worse than the crohn 's disease this product has really helped her from having to many episodes or being sick as often . 
i'm not one to believe in supplements , but this product was the only thing that helped my anxiety i was getting really bad panic attacks from what my doctor said was anxiety i feel overall much healthier after taking this product and i have n't had barely any anxiety issues definitely recommend this to anyone that is trying to tame their high stress or anxiety . 
our acupuncturist recommended this to us , to lower my cholesterol and to lower my husband 's blood pressure so far so good we have been taking it for a little over a month , so in a few more months , we 'll have a better idea of its effectiveness we take two capsules in the morning and two at night . 
this is a great source of essential fatty acids without the unpleasant tasting burps of fish oil or flax seed oil , which also does n't agree with my stomach i also think it helps my ibs symptoms . 
i take it every day i used to take fish oil but when i made the change to plant based oil for my body , it was like night and day i felt the change , and loved it . 
this product is excellent ! i highly recommend it it has the balances of nutrients i was looking for but also non gmo the product shipped quickly and is very high quality hemp seed oil i'm extremely impressed ! i ca n't wait to buy my next supply because of all the benefits ! i 've already noticed a difference in how my skin behaves , how my hair grows and the strength of my nails and i 've only been taking it for about 10 days ! ! i do n't experience nearly as much nausea with taking this supplement as i do with others \( such as flaxseed oil \) and i also do n't have to worry about the presence of gmo substances in it either thanks again for selling such a wholesome product \) . 
this has been a boon for my digestive system ! i take 3 tablets twice daily morning \( after breakfast \) and evening \( after dinner \) i have n't had any problems whatsoever for at least the last couple of months of taking the hemp oil capsules ! i plan to continue taking them for a long time into the future ! br br btw , i started taking these capsules because hemp oil contains essential omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids in the 3 1 balanced ratio , and the capsules do n't have the weird after taste that plain hemp oil does . 
i purchased the hemp oil for my mom to help with pain relieve the omega oils are suppose to help with join movement and pain i have noticed that when she takes the vitamin her pain is less than the times that we are out and she has to wait . 
i love this brand and please tell everyone you know hemp oil is sooooo beneficial for you do your research you will understand that getting 3 omegas and some . 
it is hard to tell most of the time if supplements work but i just have a greater sense of well being when i take this product it really is a good source for essential fatty acids i expect to keep taking it . 
the hemp oil soft gels really help my sensitive digestion \( along with the probiotic , enzyme and lactose pills \) of course , i still have to watch what i eat and how fast i eat it \( slowing down really helps bad digestion \) i suggest buying this product in bulk because the more you take the better it seems to help . 
i 've tried most of the virginia chutney co \( vcc \) product range and particularly like their spicy plum chutney it is good with cold meats , salads , cheddar cheese , and curries . 
i first tasted this at petrossian i had ordered green tea and when i tasted it , i was a little shocked that it was not regular green tea i noticed the citron immediately and it was fantastic it complimented the tea very well the tea is very light au bon pain also carries this tea try it out ! . 
one of my favorite restaurants serves this tea iced they were kind enough to share the brand name with me when i asked it makes wonderful , refreshing and healthful iced tea highly recommend . 
as a gum addict , i was looking for a natural alternative to the artificial flavor artificial sweetener varieties this gum is great now , the flavor comes from real peppermint , so it 's not going to last as long as the fake stuff , nor it will be as mind blowingly intense as some of the new super flavored gums but if that 's ok with you and you 'd like to chew something that does n't put weird chemicals into your body , this is for you it 's expensive , sadly , but what can you expect \? buying it in bulk here helps . 
i like to chew gum and i also like my teeth i am also allergic to most artifical sweetners and it is getting more and more difficult to find sugar free gums that do not contain aspartame this is why i purchased this product in the first place i like the flavor and it lasts quite a long time the packets are the perfect size to fit in your pocket or purse i always have some on hand at work , especially for after lunch i will certainly be buying more . 
very tasty gum and the xylitol is wonderful my youngest daughter 's dentist recommneds that she chew xylitol gum 3 to 4 times each day to help prevent cavities her baby teeth had a cavity in every tooth along with three crowns ! ! ! ! her adult teeth seem to be much more cavity resistent and i believe the gum is helping prevent the cavities . 
if you look at the vast majority of sugar free gums in the store , you 'll see all kinds of nasty chemicals on the ingredients label there are a few xylitol sweetened options available online and at health food or vitamin stores xylitol is a sugar alcohol that can safely be consumed by diabetics and purportedly prevents tooth decay and has some other health benefits \( research it \) xylichew is the only brand i 've found that i can definitively say is not produced in china or sourced from materials produced in china xylichew is produced in finland given china 's contaminated products record the past few years , i would trust a product from finland over china any day the gum itself has a nice peppermint flavor that does not last too long that 's okay by me , as i generally just chew this gum after a meal for dental health it 's pretty expensive , but you can get free shipping and a discount through amazon 's subscribe save program xylichew comes in other flavors , but the last time i checked peppermint is the only one available through the subscribe save program br important note keep any products with xylitol away from dogs it 's toxic to them . 
this is an excellent sugar free gum for those who do n't want saccarine or aspertame many commercial gums that are advertised as containing xylitol also contain unnatural , chemical sweeteners the flavor and soft texture lasts very well in the peppermint and fruit flavors another family member really enjoys the licorice one the chocolate has a disappointing flavor , and the cinnamon , which to me tastes like almond at first , quickly gets hard and loses flavor have n't tried spearmint while the serving size is listed as 2 pieces , i find 1 is exactly the right amount for my mouth . 
i'm into maximizing health i do n't use any artificial sweeteners or refined sugars in any form xylichew was a great find because its ingredient list is actually safe this is rare for a gum the gum has a great taste , it has the right amount of sweetness , and the pieces are a good size i take half a piece at a time , while my wife prefers a whole piece if you are looking for a safe gum this is the one and amazon has such a sweet deal on it do n't pass it up ! . 
i had a very long day got to work early , worked about nine hours , headed for the airport and had to go through a connecting flight and about 5 hours of travel and when i got home i still had some work to do and needed a boost to get me through it br br after hearing a radio ad for this product , i picked up a two pack and used one of them when i got home br br it promised five hours of energy without crashing i ca n't attest to the five hours \( did n't quite pay attention \) , but it did last for quite a while and i had no crash effect in the end i was n't overly anxious or nervous , but i could think clearly and get the work done that i needed to get done so it most definately delivers on its promises br br the things that i like the most is the fact that there is no sugar i also appreciate the fact that they use water instead of carbonated water , which is the main reason i do n't like the monsters , rockstar , red bull , etc products \( diet versions , of course \) it also gives all this energy in 2 ounces instead of having to drink a large soda can worth of drink the taste was n't fantastic , but it could have been much worst and only takes a good gulp to get it all down br br i 've been looking for a product like this to get me going in the mornings and this seems to fit the bill my only problem with this is that it is a bit on the pricey side today i am also trying out one that is similar , called enduroshot , a 2 2 ounce energy shot that claims all the same benefits that this promises but at a much lower price i 'll do a review on that sometime soon in the future if i feel just as awake and alert as i do with 5 hour energy , then i will use it instead otherwise , chaser has a new , steady customer . 
although the taste leaves something to be desired , 5 hour energy worked very well i drank one halfway through my workday , and pepped up enough to go out and wash the ambulance my arms hurt later that night , but the product itself worked for me . 
well u get the energy u really want for the 5 hours and it really boast u a bit but that u will be calm again and need to rest not bad great product . 
the energy drink is a great product the shipping price is crazy tho i paid more for the shipping then both products together , so not a great deal . 
i recently gave up my major 20 year diet coke addiction i did it for a number of reasons i typically wake very early to hit the gym before work needed something to help me wake up at 4 30 am this product is great no over stimulation as it only has the caffeine equivalent of 1 cup of jo it is also sugar free and has 0 net carbs ! ! i do feel the energy quickly it lasts the 5 hours it claims the berry flavor is pleasant , but tart so i drink some water as a chaser \( no pun intended \) i drink water the rest of the day only use 1 in the morning unless i have a late meeting scheduled . 
finally , a product that gives you that extra boost you need for anything from travel delays to the overdue stack of paperwork you feel the effects instantly with more energy and a higher concentration level it stays with you and does not leave you feeling dopey or spent when it wears off . 
this is the best energy product i have ever used it starts working right away and keeps you going for a long time . 
i sampled this cake as offered from biscoff 1 month ago and fell in love it is extremely moist and is most delicious when sliced thin to accompany a cup of coffee the ingredients are perfectly blended as no one taste is overpowering , but you are able to taste each individual ingredient if you are looking for a great coffee or tea accompaniment , please give this cake a try ! . 
this is the moistest , most delicious cake in the world if you like almond tarts , marzipan , that kind of taste , you will be in love with this cake normally i think packaged cake is awful , by the way this one is amazing . 
first , the ingredients list is wrong they are almonds , not cashews i do n't have a recent bag \( just ordered \) , but i have seen some with tapioca syrup and some with rice syrup listed in the ingredients my 6 year old son has tons of foods he needs to avoid , so these distinctions are important to us ! luckily , he has been able to eat these and loves them br br the pieces in the bag vary in size the most typical is about 1 1 5 long by 3 4 wide there will be some loose crumbs in the bottom too it looks like they make them in a big pan and then cut them down i would compare them to bite size \( or 2 bite sized \) granola bars it is just the right amount of sweetness added i love that these have a nice protein boost when i need to grab something and go . 
i spent some time searching for an alcohol free rum flavor to make daiquiri sorbet , and lorann has produced the best flavor thus far \( which tastes outstanding \) it blows away the competitors that i have tried baking with it has not yet been attempted , but i imagine there would be similar results the price is quite reasonable for a 4 oz bottle , although it is much more so if multiple bottles are ordered \( save on shipping \) it has natural and artificial ingredients i would prefer it to be all natural , but that 's a price i'm willing to pay for the flavor i predict this will remain my alcohol free rum flavor of choice . 
raw is eating from your organic garden of fresh grown fruits and vegetables it is also all the nuts growing from the mountains that surrounds us through out the land from the forest although grown from a tiny little seed that the sun and rain helps in growth it is our heavenly father our creator god who truly makes them grow and should be appreciated for his gift of life to us all and for our home the planet we call earth br i used to be a true vegetarian then i went to only eating poultry and some fish and eggs through out the years now i will eat vegetarian soup made with some beef stock but i do n't care for the meat itself and no pork br i am still organic alternative and green but i am slowly trying to go back to being that true vegetarian that i used to be however going raw will take a some time because i have a little hard time chewing with my teeth like my friend but after i get my dentures i will be able to adjust into it right now i am canning for winter storage i have dehydrated my whole garden into green super power food that i added to my barley greens note if you choose to cook get the fagor pressure cooker caner that i got it helps make the meals go quicker and is a lot healthier than baking and broiling or grilling and never fry food br well i will let you know how the canning turn out and one day i 'd like to make home made all fruit yes that 's right not jelly or jam br hi again so far so good i have canned 4 pint jars of my home made spaghetti sauce with 4 of chili and 4 vegetarian soups with 2 red cabbages and they sealed and are ready for winter when things get rough as around here it is hard to get organics so when i do i get all that i can like i just got up at the farmers market this late fall and then i either freeze them or can them and even dehydrate them br so i will keep you up to date but i need to try and get some organic fruits and that is hard to get again around here br well catch ya later as i never say goodbye ! just get this wonderful organic fruit nut and seed mix it has no preservatives and is delicious and affordable and if i can get it you can too just remember to soak the nuts and seeds because nature puts some protective coating on it and they need to break down this to be edible and fit for human consumption . 
put two tablespoons in a large cup of fresh coffee and you have a great coffee mocha i have recently tried several others that have been recommended and got great customer reviews online none are as good as this one . 
if you 've never tried any of ghirardelli 's hot cocoa products you are in for a treat ! made with milk , the cocoa is far superior to any other cocoa product on the market i do n't drink coffee , but have a cup of this every morning when made in the froth au lait hot chocolate latte maker , you will get the best cup of hot cocoa you ever had . 
this is the best hot chocolate next to cadbury bought in europe our 13 yr old would never drink her chocolate milk until we switched to this \( unfortunately we do n't have a steady supply of cadbury 's \) it 's great ! . 
i usually buy this from starbucks , but after buying this item on sale i will be making my coffee at home i am not a heavy coffee drinker but sometimes when i have to study i need a quick pick me up and this will do it i love all their product sometimes i add a little cinnamon grade aa and it really gives it a boost i would definitely buy this product again and i think it is a good price i saw it for a lot more in the store . 
we appreciate the short list of ingredients on the ghiradelli hot chocolate mixes the chocolate mocha flavor is rich and chocolatey with out being overpowered by the coffee this is one of our favorite cold weather drinks . 
found this product discounted at a good price at slickdeals net for about 10 br br first time drinking this stuff since i bought it i was blown away at how awesome it taste this was my first time trying something other than the nestle brand cocoa \( other than the few times i ordered cocoa at a cafe \) br br has a nice blend of mocoa cocoa and does n't taste too sweet like what i'm used to with nestle br br definitely giving this a thumbs up . 
heat 8 10 oz 2 or whole milk , not quite to boiling , in your microwave add 1 1 4 rounded teaspoons of ghirardelli mocha hot choc powder 1 1 8 rounded teaspoons of ghirardelli hazelnut hot choc powder , stirring to fully mix now add 3 4 oz christian brothers vs brandy \( optionally \) garnish with whipped cream or a small accent of vanilla ice cream and serve br notes not to be a brand whore , but christian bros \( vs , not the more expensive vsop \) is the only brandy i 've found to really have the right profile for this recipe exact proportions for all 4 ingredients should ultimately be to your own taste non fat and 1 milk are not recommended the brandy should contribute its flavor but not be so strong as to have an obvious alcoholic note i 've for many years used a 1 0 mocha 1 5 hazelnut ratio , but lately the mocha product has n't seemed as intense , so i 've adjusted you 'll know it 's right when the mocha hazelnut brandy flavors are in such balance that none is too dominant the result will be a new experience greater than the sum of its parts . 
while you would expect ghiradelli to make good chocolate , the flavor of this mocha cocoa is precisely that of great darker chocolate flavor , using just enough coffee flavor to accent the cocoa without overtaking it a smooth , delicious start or finish to your day even a warm afternoon pick me up on those chilly days ! . 
premium ghiradelli chocolate mixed with just a hit of coffee makes this a great drink i 've gotten to where i add a heaping spoonful to my starbucks coffee every morning it gives it an extra coffee flavor and the chocolate for ghiradelli far exceeds the 'mocha' chocolate you get at most barista stands . 
i use this product with my home brewed espresso and milk to make a mocha latte it 's terrific ! i ordered on the auto ship plan through amazon and save about a 1 50 per can over buying it locally plus i get the added benefit of having it delivered to my door instead of having to drive to a specialty shop to get it ! great product and great service . 
i love this hot chocolate in my opinion , it 's the best on the market it has a nice grown up flavor of chocolate and coffee . 
i used to drink ghirardelli chocolate mocha hot chocolate as a treat on weekend mornings when i was working i'm now retired and started drinking it every day i was afraid that i would get tired of it drinking it every day instead of just as a treat well , that did n't happen at all i am now what i would call addicted to it i have it every morning with my toast and my gma on tv i recently went to my mother 's place for several days and truly missed my favorite morning drink i could n't wait to have it the morning after i got home next time i'm going to be gone for several days i 'll make sure i take a canister with me i love that i 've found this product on amazon and even that i have to opportunity to have it via automatic shipment i started having trouble finding it in the stores we shop so the automatic shipment it great . 
love this hot chocolate made with skim milk for a healthier delicious hot drink creamy and tasty will never go back to supermarket hot chocolates . 
this is absolutely the best hot chocolate out there it is not too sweet , so more for adults than for kids easy to make just add milk no intense mixing required dissolves easily . 
okay , so let me preface my review by saying that i do n't drink hot chocolate that often and i'm from america and do n't think i 've ever had hot chocolate while traveling in europe , but my husband is a british citizen who grew up in india with summers in england and he has searched high and low for a chocolate drink that would remind him of those from his childhood we found it in this drink and he wont drink any other chocolate drink now \( not even the 47 other kinds that are in my pantry that i bought for him to try and after 1 cup he turned his nose up at them men \) . 
i 've been a fan of ghirardelli triple chocolate brownie mix for a long time and i also like ghirardelli chocolate candy so when i came across this chocolate mocha hot cocoa mix i wanted to give it a try cause i love cocoa and coffee i'm glad i bought it because this stuff is delicious i love the combination of chocolate and coffee the coffee in it is very subtle and definitely not overpowering it 's rich , very flavorful , and bold and as others have pointed out this is the best mix you can buy i'm very impressed . 
great deal and great transaction ! finally , an affordable way to indulge my chocolate craving will definitely buy this again ! . 
ghiradelli might not make the best chocolate in the world , but their chocolate mix is my personal favorite it is rich and mixes easily without the residue in the bottom of the cup that lesser brands suffer from the mocha flavor is very good with a strong coffee flavor that does n't overpower the chocolate this is simply great hot chocolate and well worth getting if you enjoy mocha it also mixes very well in milk shakes ! . 
i made this for my 12 year old grandson grandma this is the best hot chocolate i have ever had in my whole life ! you can guess what he got for christmas it really has a wonderful flavor top it off with whipped cream . 
best mix on the market for making cafe mocha lattes , and we 've tried them all . 
the best hot chocolate , by far not so easily available in my area br love the mocha the double chocolate . 
easy to use \( do not abuse \) , a href http www amazon com gp product b000h27nu6 ghirardelli chocolate premium hot cocoa mix , double chocolate , 16 ounce tins \( pack of 4 \) a great taste it makes you to feel good . 
try a little sprinkle on ice cream , makes a good milkshake , mix it in cakes or brownies , sprinkle on the cake , enhance coffee drinks and liquors , get rid of that pesky cat , add texture to barry and levon 's 240 pounds of pudding , brown paper mache , movie prop heroin , or dip your bananas in it i consume it with bluebell homemade vanilla ice cream i like the double chocolate better . 
great product ! love making this during the fall and winter months because the smell goes through the entire house reminding me of christmas taste great too especially when warm and with cream cheese have made it for co workers who always rave about it it 's easy to make up , too . 
i cannot tell you how many of these i made between thanksgiving and christmas ! fast , convenient and so delicious ! i got rave reviews ! thanks ! . 
i have tried nearly all of the pillsbury quick bread mixes , and this is my favorite and of course it is nearly impossible to find in a store in my area so i am really happy to find it on amazon this has a packet of actual diced apple in syrup \( sort of like the canned apples for pie \) it makes great muffins or coffee cake also you can add things to it , like raisins , cranberries , nuts , etc just super i recommend it ! . 
this is the perfect size for a snack bag for school minus one star because the glue for the straws also glues the wrapper to all of the boxes that 's annoying . 
i wonder if the other reviewer 's order got mixed up at the warehouse or something \? we received organic juice boxes , just like the title says . 
i absolutely love the peanut butter and strawberry kind bars ! they taste just like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ! . 
these potato chips are probably the best chips i flavor ever have the spicy barbecue is the perfect mix of flavors ! i have had tons of these chips and still they never get old it fits one person per bag after a few chips , you will taste the spicy part every time i see the bag , my mouth just waters br br these would be perfect for you if you are getting tired of the other potato chips ! br br depending on the stores , sometimes shipping can be expensive if that is the case , most of the times you can find it at your local oriental groceries . 
oh man , i love this candy ! it 's super delicious , but its really not that sour i 'd always collect a giant cache of quarters and spend it all on these for 50 cents each ! \) . 
our friends from germany visited with us a few weeks back , and one of them adores manhattans she had them here 15 years back , and when i no longer could find a bottled mix locally , i ordered it from the internet this is my first experience with master of mixes , and the manhattans turned out great , just as good as if i had made them from scratch a great product ! . 
i just love this chili it is beefier chunkier than other no beans chilis and the blend of seasoning is simply outstanding much more savory and less of an assault to the tastebuds than hormel 's in my opinion goes great on a hot dog , a baked potato , good to dip tortilla chips in and a wonderful companion to grilled cheese sandwiches or just toasted english muffins . 
packed poorly in shipping and a few had the seal broken because they were rolling around in the box ! . 
very good lemonade mix close to fresh in taste love that it has stevia i like it so much more than crystal light or any of the other mixes with artificial sweeteners i can take it anywhere , mix it in bottled water , and have a refreshing , healthy , safe , cool drink . 
bull dog 's chuno has become a flavorful addition to my kitchen i 've used it in everything marinades , rice , stir fries , vegetables , etc i 've also used it by itself or as a base to dipping sauces it also adds a nice component to homemade bbq sauce if i had to compare it to something it would be steak sauce everytime i want to change a dish up a bit , i use chuno i 've bought mine from somewhere else and did n't know it came in larger sizes the offering here is almost double the size , but it 's also almost triple the price however , if the place i buy it from were to stop , i 'd buy it here without fail i just wish they had the 50 less salt version . 
my dogs loved these they were cheap too only problem is they are oily to the touch given they outside is great ! . 
arrowhead mills organic savory herb stuffing has a very nice blend of herbs for a flavor that compliments chicken and turkey i especially appreciate the fact that there are no transfats used in this stuffing so i and my family can enjoy it without worry ! the stuffing is very easy to prepare , but really adds to the meal we use it all year long why wait for a holiday to enjoy good food \? . 
my daughter loved the little tin that came with her adagio tea set so much that i got her a cannister of this for christmas i think it will end up being a regular gift as we all love it so much it really is delicious , and with green tea being so good for you , we drink it all the time all the products i 've tried from adagio have been wonderful . 
i am hooked on it it 's just wonderful highly recommended for taste and flavor and price i 've tried different teas from different restaurants and tea houses , but i just love this one for home i use it nearly every day will be trying more of these teas in the future . 
i normally hate , hate , hate citrus anything in my tea i always thought it tasted the way lemon dish soap smells i received this tea in a sampler and wow , i ca n't get enough of it it 's the first citrus flavored tea i 've ever liked in my life it smells really good , sorta like froot loops , and i did n't even need to put any sugar or honey in it to enjoy it . 
it 's hard to find carrot juice in stores so i gave it a try and ordered some juice from this seller via amazon even so i felt kind of poshy doing so br well , i will do it again my six bottles of juice were shipped super fast , packaging was very good the juice itself is excellent it is actually that rich in taste that i mix it half with water or apple juice that way the already reasonable price becomes even better br i am really glad i gave it a try drinking a glas of carrot juice a day works wonders on my skin . 
this carrot juice is the best i 've tried so many other brands and this is the tastiest we love the carrot orange and the super veggie too it 's healthy and great tasting ca n't get better then that . 
they are very hard to find but whenever i do i try to stock up great flavor , perfect for munching on and still pretty healthy highly recommended . 
i purchased this product for my goats initially i like to give a warm drink of molasses water to my does after they kid and i also give a tablespoon full to any goat that seems to be feeling poorly it seems to give them a good boost when they most need it i bought an extra bottle for the house because i have always loved a bit of molasses on my biscuits much of the molasses , even that labeled blackstrap , that i have been finding in recent years is bland and seems to lack flavor this molasses is quite delicious , if you like molasses , and is rich and flavorful it also has high iron content , higher than i was finding in other brands . 
product contains 70 of adult requirement for iron in one tablespoon yet is safe and gentle on the digestive system ordered and sent to my 82 year old mother who had had some problems with diverticulitis she took three tablespoons a day for a week then tapered down she felt stronger in days ! . 
my wife has a difficult time getting enough iron , and supplements are very hard on her stomach with 70 of the usrda of iron in one serving of this blackstrap molasses , she can very easily get the iron she needs this is not in any way hard on her stomach , either it tastes very good compared to other blackstraps we tried a few have a slight edge on taste but none on iron content blackstrap is an acquired taste but worth it for natural nutrients this definitely picked up her step within a very short time \( she gets low energy and tired when she needs iron \) we will definitely be buying this again . 
i bought this for my mother on the recommendation of my family physician he said my mom has iron deficiency anemia as the name implies , iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient iron without enough iron , your body ca n't produce enough hemoglobin , a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen as a result , iron deficiency anemia can leave you tired and short of breath the solution boost your iron intake br br one tablespoon of this tasty delight has 70 rda of iron and it tastes pretty good too if you like the taste of black licorice , i 'd say you 'll probably like the taste of this . 
its a great product i would recommend this to everyone who wants a tasty sweetner other than sugar i just started using it , taste so good , the jar is almost finished . 
i love the fact that this has so much iron in it i'm a vegan and it 's not easy to get enought iron the molasses is n't quite as tasty as some i 've had , but it has about 5 times more iron , so i'm ok with it i do n't think anyone would buy molasses online if they just wanted a tasty food , so i guess it 's a winner . 
my cat suffers from bladder cysts frequently since i have used this now since november 2011 he has not had 1 attack of not being able to pass his urine i place a few drops in his food every week btw he does not like it but tolrates it at first i had to use eye dropper and place a few drops in his mouth but after time he got used to it a giant thank you this has saved me so much worry whether or not he will be ok . 
i bought this statehood gift basket to break apart the items into smaller gifts for friends family it 's over priced so i will not buy this again the contents are mainly food made in china , like graham crackers and taffy etc one of the reasons i wanted it was for the beautiful xl ceramic coffee mug in this set basket item is really large due to all the fancy packaging like novelty wrapping cardboard for bulk , so there is not that much in there it 's fun to open and it will bring back memories of a state you resided in overall i was delighted with it but not the outrageous price for china made items and some items listed in the product were not included in this particular gift \( items vary per set \) . 
wow , this tastes great , sweet and chocolaty ! like a liquid chocolate bar br br plus it is organic ! br br it does contain high glycemic cane juice , so i do n't drink too much the original and vanilla flavors are sweetened with low glycemic rice syrup they have less sugar all are organic br br i do n't know why the ingredients here say canola oil neither the good karma website nor the label on the box has that ingredient if i verified that this site is correct , and the good karma corporate website and the label on the carton are wrong , i would stop using the product perhaps this page has outdated ingredient information br br this is the richest most milk like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil , which contains up to 2 toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children ! canola oil cannot be used by us fda regulation in infant food \( one research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non autistic children , and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals look in the medical journals \) br br this product is sold in my neighborhood ralph 's \( best price \) , vc discount , and whole foods in los angeles br br the 365 brand \( whole foods own brand \) is also canola free it is much cheaper but watery in comparison i use it for cooking only plain and vanilla flavors , though br br west soy rice beverage is also canola free it has a more neutral taste and less body they have a chocolate flavor br br many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes i find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products soy milk , however , has much more protein aside from being hard to digest , i do n't eat too much soy because of the anti nutritional components so i get my protein elsewhere . 
it is a tiny bit grainy but it does n't bother me a bit , my kids really like it i use this as a chocolate syrup substitute in my kids milk to make the box go further they really love it it 's great drinking it full strength too not too sweet we love it ! . 
i love this ricemilk it has the consistency of almond milk and no soy . 
i am a saba fan it is expensive for this but the intensive flavor given to salad dressings , dips , etc is without equal use your imagination for this fruity astringent addition the only responsibily bad results is yours for poor execution . 
this is the second time that i ordered this product and i 've been very happy with it . 
found these at a local grocery store and just about fell in love with them their taste is fresher and most of the seeds live up to their name i got original , ranch and sizzlin bacon they 're all great ! when my grocery store told me they got bigs as a one time deal , i was happy to find them at amazon if you 're a seeder you 've gotta try these . 
licorice freakin rocks man , i like to take the licorice ropes and choke my self till im blue , then chew my way out man this stuff is like crack , i just want roll it up and smoke it like a big fatty . 
excited to have been able to find this candy as have been looking for ages was received very quickly and the candy was well packaged and fresh flavor will buy again thank you . 
i 've tried a bunch of them and the taste of this product is outstanding even the folks behind the counter at my gym commented on it and they sell a competing product give it a try , you wo n't be disappointed . 
it tastes delisious , and works efectively if yo drink it at the rigth time lean body is the suplement with the best flavor i 've ever tasted . 
great meal replacement drink that tastes great ! you get plenty of protein and other vital nutrients i prepare one of these whenever i'm on the go and i wo n't have to worry about missing a meal the best bang for your buck , especially if you subscribe to the amazon subscribe and save program . 
so i was doing my daily grocery shopping on amazon and i was like awwww yeah there are some rice krispie treats sure can just make them in the kitchen but then you have to clean the spoon and wash the stove and then find some saran wrap in the kitchen to keep them more yummy for the next days instead order these its simple a nice size treat that will give you plenty of treats for one day high five to snap crackle and pop you guys rule have a nice day k . 
this product is perfect for my cavalier king charles spaniel puppy his stools are very regular and healthy my vet was very pleased to know i picked this product instead of a regular store brand it 's all natural and my puppy loves it \) . 
flour type 00 is better than regular flour whether frying it or baking it , dough maintains softness and pliability br i like it a lot . 
bought four , 2 lb bags and use them to make bread and pizza dough if you have fantacies of that perfect italian pizza you had while touring through italia , this flour is just the thing the dough even smells slightly better , the final product produces the closest thing to that wonderful crust you ca n't find in the usa it 's worth the dough , for the dough . 
this is the best flour for home made pizza it has the best tasting crust i have found it works best in a super hot oven if you do n't have a pizza oven . 
i make a lot of bread my family 's favorite is my focaccia i had been purchasing a very well known flour prior to trying this i am so happy i did try it i thought my italian breads could not get any better , but this bring it up a notch i am comparing this to all the other 00 flours if you are a bread maker i urge you to include in your next order maria domenica . 
i have been to new orleans at one of the pat o briens and had there hurricanes and this mix can taste just like what you would get at the restaurant the key is that the mix makes twice as much as it says it makes , so if you go by the directions it will takes powdery so either use half as much powder or twice as much water , mix with your favorite rum \( what they use \) , vodka or gin and a nice sweet hurricane . 
this is the best quality chamomile tea i have ever tried ! this is only 1 oz so it 's a little pricey , but i will buy it again anyway , because the quality is out of this world you will get three nice cups of tea out of one tablespoon , but the first one is the best , of course i like mine strong chamomile fans will love this tea . 
chamomile tea is great with lemons and apriva chamomile tea is caffeine free that 's great for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure . 
love this coffee have bought this flavor and several others in the past recommend it to everyone will continue to buy it as long as i can afford to br the french vanilla is excellent as well ! . 
these are a great value , great size snack to have , or even share , great snack yummy have n't tried other flavors , but just might have to . 
this hot sauce has an excellent taste , unlike most of dave 's insanity sauces i put 6 10 drops into a bowl of mild chili to make it hot like the other reviewer , i 'd put it at about 1 million shus having eaten fresh bhut jolokia \( ghost \) peppers which are supposed to be 1 million shus , i 'd compare it to those br br 4 million shus would mean that the sauce is 25 pure capsaicin that would make it prohibitively expensive to manufacture or consume . 
reaaaly hot stuff way hotter than dave 's ultimate insanity rivaled only by some of blair 's sauces i do n't think it is 4 million scoville though maybe 1 million . 
listen if you want a good taste and hot this the stuff ! it wo n't melt your eyes out but it is too hot to take straight one dab will do ya on a bite of pizza ! . 
a friend brought over a bottle as a gift and i loved it enough to hop on and write a review br br i'm just arm chairing this , but i 'd put it at somewhere in the range of 300k scovilles , or somewhere around half the heat of pure cap or mad dog 357 with bullet i tested the three side by side with a dab on the finger , dubious of the 4m claim maybe they mean it was made with 4 million extract before diluted with the vinegar \? br br the thing with all those superhots is that after a point it really does n't matter they do n't have flavor , and you can always just add in a few extra drops \( i still appreciate the novelty ! \) br br either way , it is aggressively priced , nice and hot , and unlike the other two sauces i 've mentioned , has a bit of flavor from the peppers and vinegar besides being simply being 'spicy oil' i like it ! br br this is certainly going to become one of my regularly stocked hot sauces ! it would go really well in a bit of soup , pasta , mashed potatoes , pizza , chicken wings , and so forth . 
this hot sauce is great im new to the extreme heat sauces but i have previously tried fear sauce which has 1 , 100 , 000 scoville units and this sauce is by far alot hotter just two drops mixed with a little salsa on my taco had my mouth on fire its unlikely 4 , 000 , 000 scoville probaly more like 2 , 000 , 000 but i would recommend this product . 
not only does this sauce have a great taste but they have a small enough pour spout on top to allow you to pour small drops on your food , if your careful , or pour a lot it makes it easy to make something rather hot to , whew , what a heavy burn ! i love this stuff it 's in a large 5 ounce bottle and compared to sauces with less heat it has a great price \) . 
i have tried daves ghost pepper hot sauce back to back with z 's , and z 's is considerably hotter i do n't know if someone got a bad batch , but it 's painful to use more than a drop per square inch of food the first couple times you try it , nice to mix with something you want hot without a vinegary taste makes anything spicy without changing the flavor , but has a good flavor if you really go overboard with it . 
really not much i can say abut this soup mix it taste great to us we always bought the canned stuff when making pot roasts or whatever then tried this well we will never go back to canned again well worth the money will be buying more . 
these things are seriously beyond delicious ! ! just the right touch of saltiness to go with the sweet a perfect dessert or cheat snack for those long work days \) . 
i had no idea something could taste this good i'm not really a caramel person , but if i had dreamed up the most perfect balance between sweet salty buttery richness it would be these caramel sea salt squares i found them at whole foods and they are expensive , but worth every penny milk is the perfect compliment get some and you will not be disappointed you may be ruined for chocolate brownies . 
grilled out brats , chicken , and burgers for the entire family yesterday covered all of it with country bob 's seasoning and all purpose sauce ! the family loved it best sauce available ! ! ca n't wait to use it on my steaks tonight ! . 
i am very happy with this tea i hesitated to order because of price but it comes in a nice tin with 50 round tea bags it is great tasting i add ginger chips to it and it really is great when i have an upset stomach i just recently received my second order . 
i got it for under 7 dollars shipped i wouldnt pay more than eight because your not getting much cereal . 
the company has been around for over 160 years , is the company that started pg tips and started and owned red rose tea so you know you 're dealing with a quality tea company the flavor is very similar to pg tips to me but stronger it 's definitely a milk and sugar or honey tea due to it 's strength and you 'll be happy that the milk does n't 'water it down' in any way with milk you 'll still enjoy the full tea flavor the milk only enhances the taste it is a very strong tea , so be prepared for that otherwise it is a high quality , full flavored tea at an economical price pg tips is still my favorite but since i ca n't find it in my area but can find brooke bond red label at my local walmart i'm a convert due to the quality and the very similar flavor to pg tips maybe it 's just me , but i taste the similarity you wo n't regret trying this tea ! . 
my brother robert that he has purchased this exact product in this size from local indian grocers in houston tx and in austin tx area , including one purchase at a walmart store in an area with significant indian populations the tea was reported to be a wonderful product for iced tea with a faint pleasant flowery aftertaste he will purchase it again and again . 
these david 's signature beyond gourmet bacon jelly beans do indeed taste like a very sweet and smokey piece of bacon this is not flavor that i'm going to snack on , but would make a great gift for the many bacon fanatics out there my wife commented that with a little vinegar flavor added in , they would taste like pa dutch bacon dressing br br this flavor is from david klein , the creator of the famous jelly belly jelly beans , so i was thrilled to be offered this in a href http www amazon com gp product b007jbo41e david 's signature beyond gourmet jelly beans flavor sampler a to review since my family loves jelly beans br br i also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors br br cfh . 
if you are the kind of guy who really enjoys a huge slab of bacon with your breakfast , not that wimpy kind of stuff they serve at a restaurant , but the kind that hunters grab when they are together , thick , with lots of fat in the middle , you will enjoy these ! you can almost feel your cholesterol count go up as you bite into them br br now i must admit i am a wimpy , crispy kind of gal , and i like my bacon on the lean side , in fact with my allergies i have to use morningstar soy bacon \( do n't cringe ! \) so when i bit into these , i realized from the very first bite i was not their intended audience br br nope , these are not girl food they are man food if you want to carry a bag of these out to serve to your fishing or hunting buds early in the morning , this is the perfect selection for you however , you might want to consider the a href http www amazon com gp product b007jblamk david 's signature beyond gourmet jelly beans man mix a for a selection , or the milder and tamer a href http www amazon com gp product b007jbo41e david 's signature beyond gourmet jelly beans flavor sampler a both will give you a variety to try , just in case you do n't like bacon as much as you think you do br br i am grateful to have received samples of all of these from the company to try , and am basing my review on the samples which they sent \( oh , i passed the rest of my bacon ones on to my guy buddies \) . 
i bought two types of edible glitter to decorate a plain cake this one was by far the most stunning the other silver went on grey \( not that appetizing \) whereas this one had tonnes of sparkle and really made a statement highly recommended nice fast delivery too . 
i need every color that is available ! love this product ! ! received shipment very fast ! very happy with this product , will buy more . 
this stuff worked out great for my disco ball birthday cake my customer loved it ! check it out br if you are looking for a great way to add that little extra something for your treats , you found it . 
i used this product on a cake topper for a wedding cake that i made it worked out so well bride groom were very happy and got non stop compliments ! ! . 
simply wonderful ! it adds that last little bit of wow to your cake creations i will be back for more ! . 
totally amazed at how far a small amount of this glitter can be spread i bought 3 to decorate a wedding cake used less than 1 2 of one ! it was beautiful worth the money . 
this is a very tasty product this is my first time trying this , and i am glad i ordered it to see how it tastes as a product i 'd order it again br br one odd thing though that will cause me to lower this rating from 5 stars to 4 is that the listing here says a pound , but on the label 16 ounces is crossed out and 14 ounces is written next to it i did n't weigh the container to confirm this , but if it is 14 ounces , then then they need to update their listing to show such br br since i consider shipping to not be part of a product review i wo n't lower my star rating for this , and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was slow i ordered it on june 20th a usps tracking delivery confirmation number was generated on the 21st to be fair , but it took until july 5th for me to get this even taking into account that there was a major holiday july 4th , that just seems too slow everything was packaged well enough \( although without anything like a blue ice pack to keep it cold for summer shipping \) but just took a long time to get here i do suspect the order was n't truly shipped until the week before the july 4th weekend , despite a tracking number being generated on june 21st . 
this was a gift from my lil sis awesome great flavor can taste berries and rhubarb i love it most likely will order more . 
vimto , love it fekkin expensive here though ! br that 's the problem with no longer living back in blighty , stuff like vimto becomes much more difficult to get . 
it 's true you also need a decent scale \( i used a href http www amazon com gp product b001okr89g jennings cj300 300g x 0 1g scale a \) i tried the caviar cointreau recipe and everything worked perfectly on the first try \( it 's fast too under 20 minutes i'm sure faster once you get the hang of it \) it 's fun very easy to make \( a juice recipe would be a really fun way to do an edible chemistry experiment with kids \) the kit comes with large enough samples that it looks like it 'll be good for 40 uses . 
soon after one dog was diagnosed with renal failure \( yes , she ate all the foods on that recall list \) , my westie became ill and could n't hold any food the vet did all sorts of tests , but i had to find something gentle enough for him to keep down that night i met a rep from nutro at my local petco she told me all about natural choice , gave me literature and a website to learn more i purchased this canned food along with a small bag of the dry food to mix with it turns out the dog had some sort of virus , but the food was the only food he could keep down to regain his strength due to skin allergies known to westies , i have kept him on this food and find it 's the best for him br br i just do n't understand , though , how this is sold so cheap on amazon thru petco it 's 16 99 case in the store and 15 99 on their website i think they should keep the price regulated throughout . 
now i know this formulation is not the most natural or high grade one on the market right now believe me , i have tried to get her interested in just about every brand with the word natural in the title , and she is not having it she wo n't get the benefit of the food if she wo n't eat it so when i noticed she was eating all of her food when i put this in front of her , i decided to stick with what is apparently working this is still premium food , formulated for my twelve year old 's needs , and she really , really likes it 'nuff said . 
these are perfect if you want to add some beans to another soup , or just to have any size portion of black beans right away as they are dried , they last forever , and you can have any portion size you want with a little water and microwave , they perk up to give you really good quality black beans i like these better than canned black beans , and i do n't have any more at any time than i want adding them to soups which are too watery is a great way to thicken them up you ca n't do that with canned beans which are mostly water in the first place i have n't calculated the price out , but these are probably not any more expensive than canned beans because you are n't buying any water would be perfect for camping food as well . 
i was born and raised on the east coast trenton new jersey \) i have loved tasty kakes my whole life , so its a great present to find some mew flavors or twists on old familiar receipes . 
i got this product for my husband beause he loves dr pepper it came before the date it was suppose to arrive on he loves it he wants to drink it but he doesnt , he is keeping it as a collertors item beause they dont make them anymore the item was packed good and safe and everything was there no complaints ! . 
shipping was quite a bit but the bottles were all unbroken and in good shape since dublin no longer makes d p i wanted some bottles for a keep sake these meet the bill over all good experience . 
especially as we get older , the lining of our stomach gets more sensitive to harsh chemicals and substances low acid coffee is a common sense substitute that loses no aroma or taste in the process highly recommended . 
i was delighted to find this product online , because i cannot always find it in the stores however , each package i have opened thus far is at least half reduced to crumbs because of poor packaging for shipping i doubt that i will order more using this method . 
these chips are some of the best i 've had ever ! they 're so good i dare say that they 're addictive from the very first time you try a few the taste of the salsa is delicious and the fresh chips go with lots of other foods br br the main ingredient is whole grain brown rice and yes , this is good for you i have n't had regular potato chips in quite a while but i would imagine that these chips have less fat then potato chips have there are no trans fats , no cholesterol , no preservatives , no and artificial flavors they are even wheat and gluten free ! very good ! they have less than 1 gram of sugar per serving br br they do have some sodium they have about 200mg of sodium in every serving and there are roughly five servings to a bag br br if you have further questions , the company maintains a website and an email address so you can contact them good pr ! br br overall , these are some very awesome chips ! i highly recommend them enjoy ! . 
these are the best tasting chips ever ! i ca n't get them anywhere here in denver area so went to the internet to find them would n't you know amazon came thru ! only concern is that they arrive a little crumbled i guess understandable considering they 're being shipped however , not so in store , when i could still get them here really grateful that i can get them at all . 
love these chips i think there are so many gf baked goods \( be they less than exciting rice chips , heavy breads , grainy cakes , etc \) that just fall short of taste and texture i am knocked out by how crisp and tasty these are ! they are much like a popular orange triangular chip but better , even fresher tasting if i do n't take a serving and put the bag away first , i'm very likely to mow through it in one sitting products like these make me feel like i'm not sacrificing anything at all for the sake of going gf . 
i love these chips they are addictive it 's hard to just eat a few i tried the chili flavor that has great reviews and i do n't think they compare to the salsa fresca if you like a chip with a little kick these are perfect . 
the chips are delicious ! ! i absolutely love them they are very addicting excellent for people with gluten wheat allergies the only thing was that during the shipping process the chips became broken and crumbled , not as bad as i thought after reading other reviews but still quite a few crumbs in the bottom of the bags i would order again . 
these are great chips i have tried both the salsa fresca and sweet chili and love them both \( if i had to choose one over the other would take the salsa fresca just my personal preference \) will be trying the sea salt in the near future br br ca n't go wrong with these chips ! . 
i make for my wife capuccinno in the mourning befor she goes to work br and i use flavored coffee in the esspreso machine and it is hard to find br hazelnut flavored ground coffee at a reasonable price or finding just flavored br beans this 5pound bag from coffee bean direct was an excellent price and br the flavor was very good also a great choice for paople who grind their br own coffee beans . 
this coffee tastes like a good cityroast coffee with a mild hazelnut flavor it 's good i am a big fan of hazelnut , and i would like the flavor to be a little stronger br br my husband loves the aroma of this one and he prefers it to the boyer hazelnut because it is a little darker roast than the boyer . 
smells great , looks great and tastes great as a guy who likes strong espresso type coffee , i was surprised and impressed by the bold flavor with just a hint of hazelnut with just a little half and half its great first thing in the morning . 
my husband loves hazelnut coffee but the price of flavored coffee is so high , i used to only give it to him once a week , but now i can afford to give him his favorite everyday ! he loves the rich flavor ! . 
i have been buying this coffee for at least 3 years and i love it smooth taste with a hint of hazelnut friends enjoy coming over just for a good cup of coffee . 
this is a nice middle it 's a good tasting roast coffee , with some hazelnut flavor i 'd say it is as good or better than the wal mart millstone hazelnut coffee more of the hazelnut flavor is often too much for moi br br it 's not the best coffee i ever had , but it 's just fine considering that it only costs about 6 25 lb in the current market \( millstone is about 9 \) br br my only problem is what the product is 5 lbs it 's hard to keep that amount fresh , unless you are a restaurant when a package is opened , i package the full 5 lbs in wal mart \( \) coffee bags , 1 2 lb per bag , then double bag it into freezer bags , and pop that into the freezer that way it stays fairly fresh , as defined by the aroma which is really nice when fresh , and less so when not . 
trying something new with this coffee did n't blow me away but for the price , it 's excellent i do n't have anything bad to say about it other than it 's a big bag and i am mildly concerned with freshness toward the end , but we burn thru beans pretty fast d . 
i have been so called a hazelnut coffee freak for about 10 years and i have to say that i finaly found the match to the hazelnut coffee my father in law offered me whenever i was over visiting he has passed away so i can not say if it was from coffee bean direct but darn it it sure taste just like what he brewed up thanks you for the good cup of coffee and at a reasonable price i got this page book marked for later orders tla . 
this coffee is good i have tried a lot of hazelnut coffees and this is one of the best i got from amazon it has a darker and richer flavor than most hazelnut coffee it was fresh and tasty and the price was great at about 6 per pound with subscribe and save i will order it again . 
finally , an affordable flavored coffee worth drinking br coffee bean direct hazelnut is a really smooth , medium roast coffee with a definite hazelnut flavor br the flavoring is not sweetened , which is a real plus , especially if you do n't like sweeteners in your coffee \( if you do , you have complete control yourself \) br the flavor is not overpowering , but is enough to let you know you are drinking a hazelnut coffee br those who have complained may have received a bad batch usually the blend is good and roasting consistant , but , as with any other food product , variations and accidents do happen br i have been using coffee bean direct coffee for about five years and have not yet received a bad batch br this one is a winner . 
since folgers discontinued their hazelnut i have tried atleast 10 different brands finally the best this coffee is the best hazelnut whole bean we have found in years love the taste , the smoothness , , , it is wonderful finally amazon found a good one we put this on regular shipments do not want to lose them thrilled with the taste thank you amazon tried so many my husband and i love it and will follow them where ever they will go br br mj wood br br because of amazon and it 's fast shipping and regular monthly program we will buy more grocery products from them it is easy , fast and cheaper than the store br br now looking for more products that save us a trip to the store thank you amazon you make it easier for us br br i remember years ago when my grandmother would call the grocery store give them a list and they delivered it to her home now i have amazon to help us in our senior years br br great program for seniors or busy people reliable , money saving and great quality br br only problem i had was with chrystal light i ordered was hard as a rock like it had been in warehouse for years br br mj wood . 
before i say anything else , i am mindful of differing tastes , as well as differences in processing from one batch of coffee to another that said , i found the coffee bean direct hazelnut coffee to be evenly roasted \( medium \) and bearing a robust and rich hazelnut flavor from the first to the last cup since this is my first bag of hazelnut coffee from cbd , with which i am very pleased , i will update my comments , specifically addressing the consistency of the roasting flavoring process from batch to batch with my next purchase if my other cbd purchases are any indication , i anticipate a consistent product . 
anyone who knows yaucono will like the new packaging of mylar laminated plastic i wonder how long they packaged in layers of paper \? br br if you have not had this very rich puerto rican coffee , you must sample it and then buy in bulk juan valdez might have a good bean , but the puerto ricans do it better . 
i love this coffee i tried it in puerto rico on our honeymoon and am hooked ! i may even go back to puerto rico and get more ! . 
this is a hefty roll of mylar ! the 50 width allows more coverage , obviously , but the 1 ml thickness is what 's really nice it 's not flimsy ! . 
this creme brulee is as good as any homemade ! why bother with homemade when you can get just as delicious from a box ! easier to make too ! . 
oetker products are always the best i 've used them for years because they have unique items that are tasty and easy to prepare you absolutly cannot go wrong with this creme brulee why spend a ton of money at a restaurant when you can serve it by candlelight at home \? . 
this creme brulee is better than some of the better french restaurants i 've been to i just wish my local grocery stores would carry it ! . 
we use this coffee at my office people like it a lot and i feel good about it being organic and fair trade . 
organic , fair trade , cafe altura coffee brews a great pot of coffee 'organic' makes it healthy , and 'fair trade' makes it a responsible choice the dark blend is a flavorful choice . 
we like dark roast coffee because it has more body and tastes stronger this coffee is just that ! it 's great that it 's both organic and fair trade the 3 pack means you have coffee for a while , and the price is very good you can either recycle the can , or repurpose it around the house all in all , a very good deal ! . 
nice body and full roasted flavor at a reasonable price for a organic fair trade i 'd buy the discounted pack again , but full price cost it too much to overcome my desire for an affordable coffee . 
i ordered this for my mother in law who could not find this product anywhere near where she lives she is really enjoying this product . 
very fresh and tasty soft buns that go well with my omaha steak burger patties br they store well . 
i have n't ordered this item yet , so i ca n't speak to the customer service angle however , i have purchased this product at a local specialty food store that sadly no longer carries it and i must say it 's one of the five greatest things i have ever put in my mouth it 's so great i have literally eaten it straight from the jar ! if you 've never had lingonberries , they are crimson red , roughly the sized of blueberries , and taste a lot like sweetened cranberries , only better they do n't have the acrid taste that cranberries sometimes have , but i will say that if you dislike cranberries , this may not be your favorite thing br br of all the lingonberry products i 've tried jams and preserves the fellix preserves are my very favorite the berries are whole or in halves , the color is true and the fluid part is completely smooth , rich and has a dense texture the flavor is strong enough to stand up to the density and full flavor of a biscuit , but it 's also great on bagels or english muffins or toast and although i have n't tried doing it , i 've heard this is a great product to use in baking this would be great in a berry muffin , or as a complement to game dishes br br i highly recommend this ! . 
all of my family members are fans of fruit jams , jellies , and preserves because they are versatile food products that any person of any age can consume these food products are also friendly for people with tmj jaw problems as well when i tried hafi 's cloudberries preserves from sweden , i decided to try felix 's lingonberries preserves , too like the other amazon reviewer said , if you like the taste of cranberries , then you 'll probably like this lingonberries preserve this lingonberries jam has berries in it and looks beautiful as you spread the preserves on pancakes and soft bread it 's the color red , and kind of reminds me of cranberries , the taste and look of them , especially cranberry dressing and salads during american thanksgiving meals swedish lingonberries are very sweet and tart my recommendation is to buy both hafi 's cloudberry preserves and felix 's lingonberries preserves for your household and when you 're entertaining guests why \? because each person has different tastes , and swedish cloudberry preserves is more mild with less tartness , and would accomodate the people who would n't appreciate the tartness of swedish lingonberries if you have both swedish cloudberry and swedish lingonberry preserves , then you would cover all your bases in terms of pleasing every family member and guest when it comes to eating this jam straight from the spoon , personally for me , it is really tart , tangy , and a little strong while with cloudberry preserves , i could probably eat the whole jar without tasting or sensing a strong tartness personally for me , this lingonberries preserves tastes great with vanilla yogurt it reminds me of yoplait 's fruit in the bottom yogurts according to felix , on their jar , they say that these lingonberries ripen during summertime in northern sweden the ingredients in these preserves are wild lingonberries , sugar , and fruit pectin felix also suggest putting these preserves on meat i ordered these jars from the seller on amazon , and they did a good job wrapping and taping bubble wrap to protect each jar from breaking during transport anyways , i highly recommend trying swedish lingonberries and swedish cloudberries preserves both of these swedish treats offer different tastes that are yummy and good ! . 
very excelent quality preserve lingonberry , , i will order it again , , but the shipment pack should be covered better with strong materials , , thank u for the great felix lingonberry . 
i ca n't imagine why but it seems that grocery stores have stopped stocking this item if you have n't tried it you must , it is the best coating mix available and my family keeps asking me to make chicken only with this shake and bake it has a very different flavor than any bbq sauce on the market , a flavor all it 's own that is really delicious and goes with any side dish i have made stuffing , mashed potatoes \( a favorite \) and almost any vegetable to go with it and everyone always has a second helping of chicken it 's perfect for company because it is unique and tastes like something you would cook for a special occasion i am always afraid that they will stop making it , it really has become a staple in our home and even the most finicky people love it , kids all seem to love it and i love it because it is quick and easy it 's a very unique flavor , i want to say a little sweeter than most bbq sauces or flavorings but not really sweet , kind of like a honey bbq but better , that can be used on pork chops as well there is a plastic bag enclosed to shake it in but i find that more of the mix sticks to the sides and it is very hard to coat the chicken , a lot of wasted mix that way i put it on a plate a little at a time and add as needed , then i rinse the chicken pieces and kind of lightly roll them on the plate in the coating \( shaking a little out of the packet on spots that are not coated \) and then place them into a baking pan that i line with foil , it makes clean up much easier after cooking , almost do n't need to wash the pan this way try to get all the pieces covered especially on the tops because the bottom will come off a little bit from the grease that cooks out of the chicken any mix left in the packet i shake on pieces that do n't look completely covered and then just on top of all of them i usually get a package of about 3 or 4 half breasts and a package of 6 thighs and one pack of mix will cover it all if you roll it on a plate it becomes very sticky when it gets wet so it will stick to the plate , your fingers and of course the chicken pieces i have also used a little bit of plum jam brushed on the chicken before coating it and thats very good too , but honestly you do n't need to add anything it is delicious the way it is cook it long enough to get browned and crispy and remove it to a serving dish right away so it does n't sit in the grease and you will be extremely happy with the results i would really be interested to hear from someone who has never cooked with this before and see what they think . 
have you ever try bbq chicken wings \? br use this glase and it would be delicious br i used it a lot but usually bought it in super market today i did n't find it there so i came online and order more here price is much better here . 
for some reason they stopped selling this in stores in fort worth this is my favorite for chicken . 
i had used and come to love this product and suddenly could not find it in stores near me i came to amazon and there it was ! i could not get my card out quick enough ! i share with my daughter who also can't find this item locally br thanks amazon ! ! ! ! . 
this is the best coating glaze to help make bbq chicken i never can find it is the stores so i always buy it here and it is so much cheaper then a store i pour it in a pie pan roll the chicken in it then bake after i roll all the chicken i put the remaining glaze in a zip lock gallon bag and place in the freezer till the next time sometimes i mix the glaze with plain chicken shake n bake for a crunchy bbq coating . 
this bbq glaze shake'n'bake is great for other meats besides chicken and pork br they made great christmas gifts for grandchildren in college . 
we live in tucson az and all of a sudden we ca n't find this one product anywhere in tucson i makes the chicken so juicy and tender and the flavor is beyond compare so happy to be able to purchase some and looking forward to buying more ! ! ! ! . 
they stopped selling this at walmart which made me sad but then i found it on amazon which made me glad you have to buy in bulk but \( going by the ones that i received \) they do n't expire for over a year so as long as you store it correctly you should be able to buy in bulk even if it 's a small household like mine . 
this item is so hard to find i was so thrilled to find i could buy more than just one at a time . 
delicious , easy and quick ! kraft shake 'n bake bbq glaze for chicken and pork br br kraft bbq shake 'n bake is a great option to traditional bbq recipes and brimming with flavor perfect for company , everyday family meals , or a solitudinarian \) br br may i suggest bbq shake 'n bake chicken , cream potatoes , steamed broccoli , and a lettuce wedge salad you 'll have a great meal in under an hour br br a href http www amazon com gp product b0005zyn4o kraft shake 'n bake seasoned coating mix barbecue glaze 2 pack with shaker bag 8 pack a br br buy it now \) .

for whatever reason the only 2 grocery stores where i live no longer carry this product it is my husbands absolute favorite i am so glad i am still able to buy this product on line . 
i remember the old days of having shake and bake bbq \( i had a mother that was raising 5 girls alone \) chicken and the s b were cheap to buy in these days and we ate it a lot br br i never thought those memories could be recreated through smell and taste again , but oh my godness it was ! ! br it is just a delicious as i remember it being as a kid i bought a case of 8 and have 6 more left i do n't know why the stores do n't have this in stock one clerk said its the msg in it well people should be able to make there choices of buying it or not buying it br i am still amazed at the granular style it is and how it ends up this red sticky delicious old style bbq sauce that sticks to it like glue br it is so gooood ! ! i highly recommend buying it and it would probably be good on ribs too ! ! a href http www amazon com gp product b000e1hvw0 shake 'n bake seasoned coating mix , bbq glaze , 7 ounce boxes \( pack of 8 \) a . 
welcome to heaven , judy br what \? br yes , you have arrived br what \? br you are asleep now , thanks to celestial seasonings sleepytime tea br but i do n't remember going to sleep br my point exactly that 's why i call it heaven br but who are you \? br i am sleepytime judy and i am asleep br br what welcome relief , knowing there is a pleasant , calming antidote to the stresses of a relentlessly busy mind that sometimes refuses to shut down just walk to the kitchen , put the kettle on , pull out a celestial seasonings sleepytime teabag , place in a favorite cup mine is a slender version of a blue willow cup , pour on water at just the boiling point , and wait for the tea to steep br br meanwhile , pick up the box how many times now and read the the words br 100 natural herb tea , caffeine free br a comforting blend of chamomile and spearmint creates a lullaby of tender flavor to soothe your senses br it lets you curl up under a quilt of flavor and quiet the tensions of your world br 'the sweetest way i think of you is when the day is done ' emily dickinson br ingredients chamomile , spearmint , lemon grass , tilia flowers , blackberry leaves , orange blossoms , hawthorn berries , and rosebuds br br but before i take my cup back to bed , i look at the last panel of the box there 's papa bear asleep in his cozy chair in front of the fire , mama is carrying the baby and holding the hand of another , taking them to bed through an open door one can see two little bears already asleep in their bed all in all , a cozy room of happiness and warmth and the promise of sleep br br i sip my cup of sleepytime tea quickly , almost gulping i have learned that if i sip my usual slow sipping , i will fall asleep only halfway finished that is how efficacious the tea really is . 
sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality the natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years ! the predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint but the additional ingredients including rose buds create a satisfying , complex blend that is very tasty and soothing not only is sleepytime caffeine free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey br br sleepytime contains chamomile , spearmint , lemongrass , tilia flowers , blackberry leaves , orange blossoms , hawthorne berries and rosebuds the healing qualities of some the herbs in sleepytime are listed below , however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect blackberry leaves , which are soothing to the stomach , contain tannins which provides a tea like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect it also can be used to soothe tummy aches , headache , menstrual cramps and is a mild anti fungal br br celestial seasonings gets extra points for their packaging they utilize 100 natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they do n't package each tea bag individually instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it it keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag the art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface br br quote from the box br br ultimately , the bond of all companionship , whether in marriage or friendship , is conversation oscar wilde . 
tea has a great flavor almost what i 'd call 'spearmint' flavor which is great with honey or sugar with or without cream i drink it hot and if it does cool , it 's still good it does help me relax and go to sleep when i 've had a long day my grandchildren love the flavor and we often share a pot of tea as it is perfectly safe for them celestial seasoning teas are great teas always but sleepytime is one of their classics ! i 'd recommend this tea to anyone , as out of all of celestial seasonings teas , this is probably ranks as close to number one on my list of favorites and i do have a lot of their tea in my pantry my son swears i must own stock in it , lol if you like tea , try it , i really think you 'll be glad you did as i feel sleepytime truly is one of their best teas \) . 
at it 's best i have been drinking this tea since high school and the flavor has not wavered i 've tried plain chamomile and it did n't make the cut nothing beats a cup or two of sleepy time before bed as it calms the nerves and settles the tummy what a perfect way to drift off into slumber ! . 
just 1 cup in the evening caps off my day and gets me relaxed and is a permanent part of my bedtime prep this cs sleepytime tea is my absolute favorite evening tea ritual ! i think it is the wonderful flavor of camomile plus the spearmint that adds that extra something refreshing ahhhh \( sigh \) big yawn i'm toddling off to sleep now p s i also love a cup anytime i'm feeling somewhat stressed and especially whenever i need to wind down like after a long time on the computer or after stressful shopping trips take a cup and you 'll really be in a mellow place . 
tea 's are very personal and everyone has their favorites i really enjoy this tea when relaxing , or before bed the subtle mint flavor seems to comfort and sooth a little sugar \( i'm not a fan of honey \) really makes all the flavors pop ! being a fan of this tea it was a no brainer to order it in bulk , the price at the time was great , cheaper then the grocery store \( by far \) the packaging was efficient and made it really easy to store . 
i love sleepytime tea at night while i'm laying in bed reading a book , winding down for sleep it has a fresh , comforting flavor , and a really great scent it is a main part of my relaxing bedtime ritual , and i make use of amazon 's automatic re ordering program , which saves me so much money compared to grocery store prices i only gave 4 stars because after about a week of drinking it every night it kind of loses it 's charm that 's when i alternate it with celestial 's tension tamer , just to keep things interesting great product for herbal tea lovers , and again , a much better price here than in the grocery stores . 
i love sleepy time tea , i used to give it to my children , since it is caffeine free , as they grew up , it helped them warm up and fall asleep quickly br br just a little story and a small cup of warm tea , that was the routine especially in the winter they are all grown now but i find that they are now serving it to my grand children and it is having the save effect br br i still drink it between all the other teas i enjoy but this one is just a little more special . 
we make most of our tea from loose leaf in a press pot sleepytime is the lone exception we 've been drinking this tea for many years now and it still rates among our very favorites it 's the perfect blend of camomile and mint and you gotta love the bear . 
have used this herbal tea for sometime now one cup before bedtime and it always helps me rest better love the discount for ordering the six months supply . 
i have been purchasing and drinking this tea for years in fact since mo siegel used to advertise it on tv now that is a long time ago it really helps calm frazzled adults as well as hyper children before bed but what is more share worthy is the fact that it is a great tea for children that suffer from motion sickness br our oldest daughter used to be car sick all the time we carried an endless supply of baggies for her as she would 8 out of 10 times relieve herself when commuting back and forth to school br we discovered that this tea , given 20 minutes before the ride and every hour or so on long family trips curtailed her horrid events completely the main ingredient is chamomile and it really helps relieve motion sickness and soothe frazzled nerves . 
when ordering in bulk with the repeat shipping option , this tasty tea is a great value . 
sleepytime tea is one of those teas that can always be counted on it 's very mellow , with a great taste and smell perfect for relaxing after a long day this is the tea that all other herbal teas should be measured against . 
valerian and chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves , lemon grass , hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams this tea is much more effective than regular sleepytime and i can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning you may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general this could be due to getting a good night 's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect valerian is a very effective herb if you ca n't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia unlike sleeping pills , you wo n't feel groggy the next morning blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea br br the rebecca review . 
what a wonderful product ! br i can drink it all times of the day , so obviously the original sleepytime tea causes no real drowsiness br br i start my day with the tea and end it with the tea br it makes me so relaxed and it 's healthier then smoking lol br br it 's also made me a fan of sugarless tea br never again will i go back to sweet tea or terriable diet sodas ! br br try some sleepytime tea if you love tea ! the flavor is amazing and very smooth as well as unique it 's great hot or cold ! br you will not be dissappointed . 
this product is so great my daughter who is extremely pick loves it and she is also gluten free ! ! so she can actually have this ! ! ! ! ! br not bad for 100 calories per serving ! ! ! ! ! br this will be a great dish to take for thanksgiving dinner . 
i like to make this when i make chicken fajitas or dirty rice , it is a nice compliment and does not dry out as much as jiffy 's corn muffin mix \( which i used to use \) this packet , water , half a stick of butter and a can of creamed corn is all it takes , then bake for 45 minutes it is moist and sweet , it does not last long in my house ! . 
easy and delicious ! have made it in a 9x5 loaf pan as well as in a mini muffin pan both methods yield a great tasting product . 
i make this product when we have any kind of tex mex meal everyone loves it it is easy to make and tastes great . 
seems stange that any item this good and tasty would disappear from stock iun the stores so glad to find it on amazon and at the rate we eat this especially in the winter with chili , wo n't have any problem going thru the bulk order of 12 pkgs br thank you amazon and chi chi 's ! . 
i had a taco party and almsot every single guest asked me how do i make the corncake \? i run out every year . 
this little packet makes a whole pan full of sweet corn goodness is it a side dish or a dessert or both \? you decide easy to prepare and delicious on the table . 
i love chi chi 's corn cake and i love that i can purchase it from amazon my local grocery store stopped carrying it and i was so happy to see that i could order it from amazon i would give it 5 stars but not everyone in my family loves it \( i do n't know why , it is so yummy \) it is a delicious side to any mexican meal ! . 
i grew up in southern california , so i 've had my share of sweet corn cakes at local restaurants this mix is a great way to make these at home i prepared a package of these for a friend of mine \( who lives on the east coast and had never tried a corn cake \) she 's now addicted but ca n't find them at her local store thank goodness for amazon ! . 
i have tried to duplicate this without having to buy the prepackaged stuff , but have never come close the stuff this creates is outstanding in texture and flavor i have always like the little dollop of corn yumminess that they sell at the tex mex chain chevy 's and this is almost a spot on replication of it great stuff for even picky eaters like young kids . 
i made the recipe on the package and my family loved this dish i will make it many , many times my grandson said he wanted a whole dishful just for himself ! . 
i had never made this or had it at a mexican food diner , so i did not know what to expect it is good and very moist , but if you use creamed corn with added sugar in it your muffins or corn loaf will be very sweet i will make my own cream corn to add next time instead of using libby 's canned cream corn which is high in salt and sugar i like sweets but this was a little over the top using canned cream corn the first ingredient in the dry mix is sugar , not corn masa as listed on the amazon site so be advised this is definitely a dessert . 
sooo happy amazon sells this ! the one grocery store that has it in my neighborhood is closing ! ! ! ! this is delicious ! ! ! perfect for a fiesta night ! . 
delicious reminds me exactly of the corn cake they use to serve at their restaurants i make this with every mexican night we have at home . 
i 've got no talent in the kitchen but in today 's economy hosts really appreciate guests who contribute to the atmosphere by bringing a side dish i 'd sampled this corn cake at a friends and could n't believe it came from a mix i immediately ordered the mix from amazon and put it to the test so easy \( water , melted butter and a cake pan \) even i could n't mess it up ! ! i took it to the next gathering where it was a hit i only wish it came in a smaller shipment \( min shipment is a pack of 12 \) but since everyone always seems to want the recipe , we can share . 
i too am so glad amazon sells this ! ! i sometimes add a 1 4 cup of sugar when i want it sweeter \) . 
all the chi chi 's closed in my area i was able to get this mix at the grocery store , but lately it has not been on the shelves i am so happy to have found it on amazon this mix is awesome great for taco night ! ! ! . 
our daughter was very unhappy because she could not find chi chi 's sweet corn cake mix in her grocery stores thanks to amazon com the fix was easy we had corn cake while dining on lake powell heard the grand kids were enjoying more chi chi 's corn cake last night thank you ! sr . 
i really like this product when my grocery stopped carrying it , i ordered it through the mail this is more of a quick bread than a cake , and it requires a can of cream style corn the result is very moist and has a good corn flavor i bake it in muffin pans in cupcake papers , and a dozen are small it makes about 8 good sized muffins i also bake these longer than specified on the package , because i seem to like things that are more done than many people these store well in a plastic bag in the refrigerator if they are not all eaten by the end of the meal . 
chi chi 's sweet corn cake is awesome the stores in our area stopped stocking this item so happy to have found it on amazon com no other corn bread cake mix comes close to being as good as this it goes great with taco 's , nacho 's and chili we also like to add in some frozen corn before we bake it yum ! ! ! ! . 
i 've been a fan of this stuff for years make sure you stir it up after you pull it out of the microwave since the grease seems to float to the top it is quick , easy , and makes for a tasty lunch when you are short on time or do n't feel like going out for lunch . 
it is n't healthy , despite the description above , though i did not buy it for that reason i love pasta , but for my uses preparing a fresh batch , then adding the sauce would be both expensive , and time consuming this is the best solution i will buy this variety again in the future , in the can version , for more days . 
great for a snack \( i eat a 2500 calorie day diet \) i eat this between lunch and work and it hits the spot an entire bowl is 400 calories arrived on time and its easier and cheaper than buying in bulk at acme or other such \( not costco but i dont have my own member card \) . 
i received the box of chocolate and was very pleased the box was in excellent shape and was wrapped well the candies were fresh and delicious would get again . 
this 2 lb box of chocolates was a wonderful gift for my 20 year old niece ! the quality of the chocolates was amazing , but more importantly was the long lasting pleasure the young lady got a double gift ! thanks amazon ! a href http www amazon com gp product b0042gwkwo see 's candies 2 lb assorted chocolates a . 
speaking as another texan , i think the first rule for these delicious treats is to not order them during spring or summer in fact , your safest bet is to only order them in the dead of winter lol ! as long as you do that , be prepared for a truly amazing treat ! this package comes with 12 bite sized delicacies the chocolate is high quality , the nuts are crunchy , and the overall taste could n't be better definitely worth the price ! . 
i cannot believe that i found these on amazon ! ! ! ! i became addicted to the little , choclate covered , macadamia delights in tokyo and thought that i would be doomed to a life without them back in the states be warned consumer ! highly addictive ! ! ! highly addictive ! ! ! recently , i mourned the devouration of my last box but i 've found them again ! ! ! ! i can live ! i can live ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . 
i really enjoyed eating this macadamia delights from meiji the chocolate has a great , and not too sweet , taste the nuts are a bit small , if you are used to larger varieties , but that is a small problem br br i found they were not good for my feeding frenzies stuffing a whole box down in about 3 minutes is not a good idea , as the chocolate can leave a bit of an aftertaste in the throat taken at a more leisurely pace , they are a real treat . 
the actual product deserves 5 stars , the reason i gave it 4 stars is because its like three dollars at asianfoodgrocer com that 's where i order it from , not amazon much lower prices . 
i did n't buy them here but i did buy them from buford highway farmers market here in atlanta and they are wonderful they are worth a try \) . 
this will be a short review \( for me \) br br i am somewhat of a tea connoisseur , so for me to give a tea 5 stars well this is a first for me in an amazon review br br like other reviews of this product , it is a beautiful delight to watch this hand sewn tea unfold in the pot delicate , thin first flush leaves surround a beautiful red center of hibiscus the liquor is a light honey color , and the apricot overtones are pronounced on the palate br br i would recommend this tea for anyone who enjoys green \( or white \) teas wants to become more familiar with them , or as a gift for someone . 
this is the sugar i use for all my white sugar needs it 's very fine , somewhere between the dust like qualities of powdered sugar and regular sugar it dissolves very well into drinks without that somewhat odd tastes powdered sugar can have because of the corn starch or the granularity of not dissolving completely like granulated sugar which makes it perfect for cold drinks br when baking with it , because it 's so fine , i usually use a scant cup \( 1 cup 1 tablespoon \) instead of a full cup that seems to work well for me br excellent for meringues and fudge because it 's so fine and dissolves so well . 
we 've been trying various rices including aquarello carnaroli and this vialone nano is by far the best it 's very forgiving of lapses in technique and produced the creamiest risotto of the five brands of rice we 've tried br br be sure to have an airtight container to store the unused rice from each package the vacuum pack plastic is too stiff to close well . 
great for risotto creates creamy finished product , while maintaining a good 'al dente' bite , better than any other rice i have used . 
if you want to make authentic italian risotto for a reasonable price , buy this rice ! vialone nano is in my opinion the very best for making risotto you have to follow the true process , starting with sweated shallots , then parching the rice , then deglazing with white wine , and finally adding hot stock in small amounts while stirring often if you follow this procedure \( and or find a good recipe \) , you will be rewarded with some of the creamiest , most mouth meltingly tender rice you 've ever had why pay for it in a restaurant when it 's so easy to make at home \? . 
my dog is simply crazy about these treats but what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi long lasting morsel of enjoyment in additon to that , since these treats are all natural , they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats , making them extra healthy br br the price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you ca n't beat the quality . 
all the dogs on my christmas list loved this they ate it right away . 
these seeds are awesome , good size with the perfect amount of spice buffalo to ranch flavoring i 've only been able to find them here locally at 2 or 3 other gas stations , ordering them via amazon is obviously cheaper and saves me nearly 4 5 dollars buying the box . 
this new flavor is great not too spicy as i thought it would be in fact , it has the flavor of buffalo sauce but not the heat which i like i tried these from the local convenience store but from amazon , the shipped price is really good so i bought a couple of ten packs ca n't wait i 've been out for a few days now and need something to snack on at work . 
these are jumbo and flavored nicely , i ended up saving 40 per pack as well , good deal once u go jumbo u never go back . 
these are good sized seeds , and they taste good , not over roasted i know this as i rinse them before i eat them the flavor is a little strong for me , which if you knew me would not surprise you i'm not the biggest fan on spices that add heat if you like buffalo wings , i'm sure you 'll love these it was the ranch part of the flavor that caught my eye . 
looking for a good tasting jumbo sunflower seed that is not too salty and has an outstanding flavor \? then these are for you ! br br they have an awesome flavor are jumbo size and the price wo n't hurt your pocketbook i would recommend them to anyone unfortunately they are hard to find and when you do find some they fly off the shelf , so they must be good ! . 
the seeds are large and roasted perfectly i lived in upstate ny near buffalo when the buffalo wings phenomenon started and have been eating them ever since these seeds do n't even have the faintest resemblance to buffalo wings if you are looking for that taste do n't buy them if you are looking for a great spicy ranch taste then these are for you the only flavored seeds available near me are the plain ranch they are ok , but these have that extra bit of spice that really makes them great br br will be buying these again and highly recommend them to anyone who likes the spicy , yet not too hot ranch taste . 
it was this or a big tub of spice drops these are better for diabetics they did n't last long , and my wife enjoys the mess i make 'round the la z boy . 
the only thing keeping this product from five stars are all of the broken shells at the top of the bag , i found a number of half shells however , when i got to the bottom i realized that many of the seeds had collected there in a pile of shell remnants and seasoning salt blow the seasoning off and you may lose some seeds as well otherwise , a great eating experience . 
the jumbo size is great , and makes for easier consuming those of you ranch heads like me , do yourself a favor and immediately upgrade this flavor is even better , easily the best david has to offer great price on amazon , especially since these flavor seeds are pretty hard to find in regular stores . 
these are the best sunflower seeds ever the bigger size makes them easier to eat load of flavor in every bag ! . 
the maxwell house international coffee vanilla nut cafe is absolutely my favorite flavor ! seems to be extremely difficult to locate now , though last purchase was made through amazon and hoping it will become available again soon ! . 
excellent energy drink , i drink one a day before i go for my daily walk , gives me a nice boost ! i like the taste , may take a few too get used to it ! no jitters just a boost ! . 
i started using celsius over two year ago gives just the right boost i needed to exercise in the mornings no crash or after affects has a great taste , nothing strong or overwhelming . 
my cat loves fancy feast cat food and this variety pack in particular makes mealtime a veritable newsworthy event ! he always eats it down and he loves it i can tell br br you get eight cans of ocean whitefish tuna feast eight more cans of savory salmon feast with cod and eight more cans still of sole shrimp feast very good ! br br the food does have some nutritional content i always look for that when i buy food for the cat there 's some vitamin e , a , d3 , b12 , and b1 i like that naturally , ask your vet if you have any concerns about your cat 's personal individual needs for nutritional content in their daily diet br br if you catch a sale on this , stock up ! however , i would use these cans of food within six months of buying them br br overall , this is one of the better brands of cat food out there and i recommend it your cat will love it and it has nutritional content which is great for them , too . 
these fancy feast variety packs , which contain twenty four cans , always ensure that you have a good supply of cat food on hand i also do not have to waste my time stacking individual cans i always have a box of this one , the gourmet variety pack , which is fish and seafood based , on hand it contains eight cans each of ground ocean whitefish and tuna , salmon and cod , as well as sole and shrimp br br i also always have on hand the fancy feast sliced variety pack , which contains eight cans each of beef , chicken hearts and livers , and turkey in addition , i also have a box of the fancy feast grilled variety pack on hand , at all times , which contains eight cans each of grilled beef , turkey , and chicken , each in their own savory sauce my cat , mamushka , loves them all . 
great oysters , fast shipping ca n't find them local so i took a chance and they were great ! they were frozen when i got them and package was well packed . 
i was just a little wary ordering this because of the other reviews that said it was super salty and way too tough but i gave it a shot anyway i do n't know if it was because i ordered a different flavor \( teriyaki \) or if i just got lucky nonetheless , i think these jerky strips are some of the best i 've ever had i will admit to the fact that they are just a little salty , but nothing an ice cold cola or beer of your choice wo n't fix as per being tough , i munched down five or six right out of the container as soon as i opened it i just could n't stop myself , they were that good for all that chewing my jaw is none the worse for the wear so for those of you out there that are real jerky fans , this is definitely worth trying br br update i did a little research because i was curious as to why everyone thought this jerky was too salty i looked up the nutrition facts on all 4 flavors both the original peppered contain 650mg of sodium , the wood smoked had 570mg , and the teriyaki has only 440mg of sodium so if you thought the others were too salty , or are worried about this jerky being too salty , try the teriyaki i highly recommend it it 's not too salty , just a hint of sweet from the teriyaki , but still nice pepper flavor as well . 
with jack links buying king b , it looks like they have repackaged the original beef jerky strips in this label with the same great results i hope they keep up with the demand as everyone else finds them as i did thanks for bring them back jack links ! . 
i dont review often , but this stuff is just what i was looking for i ordered about 150 of jerky to try all the types i havent yet tried , and i popped this can first br br i already found what i want ! the taste is excellent i'ma fan of hickory smoked stuff as it is the texture is good not too tough , and definately not too tender br br what else do you need \? good taste , good texture wish it was a bit cheaper at 25 lb but what can ya do . 
these beef jerky strips are really good texture is just right flavor is peppery , but also just right could be more smoky for me this is a repeat buy on my part . 
just like old style jerky whole strips of meat , not compressed chips yum yum peppery . 
this stuff is the real deal ! not too soft , not too hard , not too salty , no fat , and a great smokey flavor with just a touch of spice that makes your tongue tingle for a commercially produced product , this is really a satisfying strip of jerky i was pleasantly surprised and will definately purchase again . 
walked into a convenience store and bought this for 99 and was like , nice asked the counter person if i could buy it at their rate and got the brush off did a little research and voila ! amazon comes through again bought two jars , and the wife and kids cleaned me out i will be getting this sent to me monthly soon . 
as processed , mass produced jerkies go , this is one of the best i 've had it compares with king b i do n't care for all of the poisonous preservatives and processing , but that comes with eating anything these days unless you go and find a hunter you can buy from direct br fresh game jerky would be the next logical step if you can find it . 
we had been looking for king b brand jerky for months before contacting jack links to find out what happened they informed us that their smokehouse brand was indeed new branding for the king b products with speculation on them keeping the same recipe , we orderd a jar and were not disappointed ! ! the product was exactly what we had remembered the original king b to be i will definetly be ordering this again ! ! . 
this jerky reminds me a little of the artisan jerky i used to be able to find in california the strips are thin , so they 're easy to bite and the flavor is slightly spicy and definitely smokey br br my husband absolutely loved it he 's been taking 2 3 pieces per day in his lunch and they never come back home with him the way other snacks sometimes do ! i'm buying more while they 're on sale ! . 
let me tell you that this beef jerky has me wanting more i have never tasted a jerky with more flavor and taste i recommend it to anyone wanting a little more out of their jerky a . 
over the past two years , thanks to amazon , i have been sampling jerky from literally all over the u s i finally found a tasty , jerky that does n't give my jawbone a workout great meat flavor , an excellent snack . 
i miss the king b ripple style and the regular jerky too thanks jack links for at least offering this . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b001awbl82 jack link 's smokehouse beef jerky strips , wood smoke , 30 count jar a these are the real deal when it comes to jerky the whole family loves them when the grandkids come over they wipe me out the 2 year old looks for the container sitting on the microwave and says paw paw , stick these come once a month via the amazon subscribe and save just another great quality jack link 's product one of the few companies that got big , but never sacrificed quality in the process ! . 
you will love this jerky if you are a beer drinker recommend this product for sure for them nights around the campfires ! . 
these are great tasting and have good consistency and meatiness easy to eat on the run \( no mess \) . 
this jerky is the bomb ! ! ! it is by fare the best i have ever had and i have had a lot of jerky in my day . 
great flavor , and texture it may not be the best jerky out there , but for the price , i could n't find any better it comes in a few different flavors , so there 's bound to be one you like i just wish the shelf life was longer , i 'd love to keep this with the emergency food water . 
this is for all the beef jerky lovers out there if you like jerky this is the best tasting stuff that ive found anywhere all of the flavors are great the black peppered in my opinion is the best and the wood smoked is a little dry but still good i would recommend it to anybody . 
i used to eat these king b beef jerky sticks all the time when i was younger , they were my favorite ! i figured once king b was gone so was my beloved jerky , but luckily jack links has brought it back this jerky is above and beyond any of that overly sweet bagged jerky jack links sells no , instead this is the way jerky should be , nice and chewy and salty yum i know some people on here complained about the saltiness but i do n't think they 're overly salty , they 're just plain delicious order some , you wo n't regret it . 
these are the best jerky strips i have ever tasted our family has been eating them for years and they are typically a christmas delight . 
the smokehouse jerky is some of the best out there , a perfect quick snack it has s great smoke flavor and texture i even started a subscription to get it once a month save 15 by doing it br the only con would be a little on the salty side if you like jerky you ca n't go wrong with this . 
there are literally hundreds of jerky type products out there this is simply my favorite real strips of beef , not ground up hamberger , that tastes like meat instead of preservatives without teriyaki or any other flavoring or sauce good price , good product and great taste you 'll be happy with this one when i'm looking for a non sugary snack , i reach for this first . 
a coworker brought this yummyness into the office and i am so greatful i am not big beef jerky fan but this stuff totally falls under my much yum category . 
this jerky is extremely addictive ! i have had most every other brand of jerky and this is by far the best jerky i have ever had it was originally king b jerky . 
this is the only food my cat will eat if i buy another variety or brand , it sits in her bowl until it gets stale i throw it out . 
this flavor of fancy feast is decidedly the favorite of our waif of a cat she is usually a very picky eater , but this trout flavor really gets her excited br br the local store ran out of this flavor and may not restock it , so i ordered online we got a good price and the case of food arrived in good condition br br i was a little confused by the old label image that was on the web site that is just different enough from the new label that i had to double check that i was getting the item that i was expecting br br it turned out to be the correct item , so all was well . 
i think 9 lives does a better job on this variety than friskies or i should say my cat does friskies does n't look as fresh or as appetizing as 9 lives , and my cat does n't like it as well it just smells nasty and looks not quite as good as the 9 lives i think they could definitely do better on this variety maybe even add cheese to it ! my cat leaves this one in the dish but eats the 9 lives version . 
this version is ground not my current cat 's favorite version , but he really likes the taste i do wish they 'd make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too my previous cat really liked this one and usually licked the bowl clean but , neither wanted it more than once or twice a month why , i do n't know but it seems to be a little richer than the others . 
according to my cat , this stuff is just great he just licks himself for hours after eating this one and just loves the taste he will lick the bowl clean on this one and eats it usually pretty quickly but , he still does n't want it more than 2 3 times a month because it 's fish not exactly his favorite food it 's a great diversion from his regular fare and one that he truly appreciates . 
i'm so glad to shop at amazon com it have everything you need , i br love getting my season from marshalls creek spices it fresh , and br taste , and good try it you will like it i'm so glad to know about br amazon com i would n't know about marshalls creek spices br br thank you br miss andernette anderson br god bless . 
i love lemon pepper i was amazed with this one large grain and fresh very large jar that delighted me because i use this in nearly everything good tight jar to keep it fresh very inexpensive good buy for home cooks . 
this squeezy fruit as my daughter calls it , is great convenient , yummy , no added sugar i love it i just do n't understand why it is so expensive \? \? i find it at the grocery store for 2 for a four pack do n't pay this price , that 's crazy ! . 
this is my cat 's favorite one he just licks that bowl clean whenever he gets it i usually buy a case of this one at a time and judging from how often it sells out , other cats must love it too the cheese hunks are large and look quite tasty it 's just a very nice variety and something i'm sure every cat loves my previous cat about ran me down whenever i got it out to give to him and my current cat is no different give this one a try you 'll be glad you did ! . 
my cat is so picky ! i 've tried every brand and flavor and this is my cat 's favorite . 
at 60 years old i have had the care of cats my entire life presently have four cats , three of which were barn cats and one came out of the woods and adopted us these cats love and gobble up friskies pate varieties mariner 's catch , sea captain 's choice and ocean whitefish with tuna i also serve as a foster parent for the local pet shelter and find that these 3 varieties of food are the best tolerated and completely consumed of all varieties the salmon pate is very rich and i use it only as a special treat incidentally , my cats always reach great age on friskies our cat kitten died at 23 years old she jumped off of a high bed and severely injured her spine and at the time it happened the vet asked what food we used all of those years it has always been friskies dry and wet pet foods i find it is the best value and maintains our pet 's good health right to the end the youngest cat that has died in our care was 18 years old and i have have had 28 cats as permanent pets , and countless foster pets over the years . 
of course , nobody can ever figure out what cats will like , but our experience is the opposite of the one star review br br our two bengal cats ate kibble for years , but after some serious teeth problems , they had to switch to canned food we tried a few different brands and flavors they 'd eat it for a few days , then turn up their noses even expensive food from the vet 's did not please them br br so , we tried the friskies sea captains choice flavor , and they went nuts , gobbling it down like candy we only bought a few cans at a time , figuring they would tire of it , but no , they have been eating it with gusto for a coupe of months now , so we buy it by the case br br i do n't understand about it not smelling good perhaps they got a bad batch , but it smells like other cat foods to us , and the pate is easy to dish out as long as the cats love it , who are we to complain \? . 
i would have given this 5 stars but took one off for the high cost this product otherwise is just yummy ! this is spoken from the perspective of a diabetic who has n't had regular taffy for years but i think this would hold its own next to regular taffy pretty easily br its sweetened with sucralose , not maltitol so there is n't the worry of gastric upset which is the 1 reason i ordered it i do n't see why more companies do n't forgo the maltitol and just use other sweetners that have less of an impact on digestion the flavors are full and all different depending on color and yes even the dreaded bannana flavor tastes good br its soft and chewy and i feel like i am cheating when i am not at all br i am glad i found this ! . 
i bought this along with the easy freeze ice cube trays for my two dogs my vet put my lab on a diet so i have been looking for low calories treats to feed him for his evening snack each packet is only 30 calories and will fill one easy freeze ice cube tray \( six large ice cubes for the extra large size \) one packet will also fill my labs kongxl and my terriers kong medium they love it and make sure they lick their kong 's clean without getting bored with it overall a great snack ! . 
just right for making dan dan noodles and other delicious recipes glad to have this in my pantry flavorful vinegar will be useful for various dishes product delivery was great just as expected . 
milder than most vinegars , but with its own very special taste to add to ume plum vinegar , and cider vinegar for that hmmmmm layer of flavor ! . 
this is terrific honey what more can one say about it \? there was a great price when i got it , too much better than at the local supermarkets . 
this is my cat 's third favorite food it 's great stuff the gravy is so very thick and the food looks like bits of steak slicked off for your friend my cat licks the bowl clean every time and wants more they should send me discounts for as much of this stuff i buy i buy it by the case if that gives you some idea ! . 
this is another favorite in our house my cat does n't want it more than 4 times a month or so , but he still wants it and licks the bowl clean it is fish , not his favorite , but he really likes his salmon and this one is outstanding it 's ground \( why do n't they make a sliced or bits version \? \) , not his favorite either , but he does get it down pretty quickly try this one it 's a definite winner . 
this one is a great basic food whatever is in it , cats really go for and mine is no exception my current cat really does n't like the ground variety which is what this is he will eat it occasionally , so i only buy it about twice a year my previous cat had to have it more often and really enjoyed it it 's hard to judge what a cat will eat so if your cat likes ground , give this one a go because it really seems to be a big favorite . 
taste amazing the honey flavor goes well with the smoked barbeque taste it 's soft , but not too soft it also has a nice tang and spice to it , but nothing too extreme br smell as soon as i opened it , everyone in my section ran up to see what the smell was i 'd describe it as alluring and inviting not overpowering or off putting br price for a pound of this quality of jerky , i 'd expect it would cost more needless to say , you get more bang for your buck br br in short , if you want a good jerky to snack on , you ca n't go wrong with this selection do your tastebuds a favor and get this jerky . 
delicious , pretty good stuff its sweet and not like chewing on leather like some products i 've tried deffinately worth the money and for people who dont like crazy hot jerky but still like a little bite , this is for you . 
this jerky is flavorful and tender ca n't ask for much more the only problem i have with it , is that it does n't last long enough around my house \) . 
i bought this product because it looked good not knowing if it would taste as good as it looked well it finally showed up by usps well packaged it 's soft smells great and tastes even better you wo n't be disappointed i 've already eaten five strips . 
this is the absolute and complete best beef jerky that i have ever had you 'll be hard pressed to find better , if you can it 's tender and has a good bite but at the same time you wo n't rip your teeth out either it 's also not too salty . 
i 've been trying different beef jerkeys and by far i find this product to be the best tasting nice meaty chunks and very flavorful . 
so good so perfect so tender so meaty so tasty so delicious you will not be able to eat just one , believe me i have tried all caps is rude . 
i am always on the lookout for good old fashioned candy funny i do not even have a sweet tooth however i really appreciate a quality candy i picked up one these purely for the fantastic packing they come in after just one taste it was obvious that the company has put love and care into producing these candies if you are looking for unique smooth and delicious old fashion candy look no further highly recommended . 
if you like a lot of flavor in each bite , this is it a little messy to handle but worth the fuss ! ! ! . 
it 's difficult to describe herbal type pills with no quick results it takes blind faith really i reckon these are ok \? i got what i ordered quickly . 
this tea is full of flavor without bitterness no additions needed you will not be disappointed do not try this earl grey if you do not like bergamot . 
i ordered this for my daughter , who does not like coffee she says it is the best tasting tea , and it brews perfectly with the keurig also like the large quantity box . 
this is the best cat food i introduced it to my 16yr old cat slowly and she is much healthier , has a shiner coat and sheds less each time i purchase , i switch up the flavors , cats love variety br great product ! . 
my two siberian cats refused almost a dozen canned foods , but this , they could not get enough of ! thank you ! a superb supplement to their dry food diet . 
just like anything else from new zealand this food is amazing my cat ca n't wait for it , and plate is always clean she loves it and i feel great buying ziwipeak they even put green muscles in this food overall food looks solid , packed with proteins and kiwi love . 
we all know how picky cats can be it may be grain free , but food still smells , looks like , and fine details in label indicate highly processed with all the extra vitamins minerals , which i think is the turnoff for the kitties does n't say up front , but also contains new zealand green mussell , which i am not sure how that ingredient fits in as i am not from new zealand , but suspect locals rely on that for nutrients as we do mussells in this country they are spoiled on the real thing minimally processed or raw rabbit , chicken , bird , wild caught salmon they will eat canned only if minimally processed another cat food bites the dust but gives the dogs another treat ! 1 star for not knowing about the new zealand mussell for still being highly processed therefore unpalatable as food for cats that love rabbit 5 star for a dog treat without the added hormones , grains , etc . 
i have a friend from england who adores fruitcake for her birthday i sent her a package of fruitcake she swooned , fruitcake in june is so decadent she loves claxton fruitcake so this was a no brainer now i want some too ! . 
this is simply the best chocolate i have ever tried in general , 3kg packages are much better than 70g valrhona 's if i had only tried 70g valrhona manjari , i would have never known how good it can be try the 70g to see which one you like and then buy 3kg package \( it will be 3 times better \) it has around one year of best before left when you buy it \( which is enough , beleive me \) br br great for cooking and sublime for eating . 
this is amazing chocolate for most baking manjari in general is wonderful , fruity and deep in taste but the feves in the 3 kg package melt super easily , the package is resealable and you can keep it in the fridge . 
so , i moved from europe to the us , i settled in my apartment etc , and after a week or so i decided that i wanted some candy i went to the supermarket and started looking for some m m 's then this weird red bag caught my eye and i thought , hah ! , this country is funny , they put an 's' instead of an 'm' on their m m 's here , and the bag is all different too br br so i took one bag home to try it i grabbed a handful of the presumed m m 's and what a surprise this was obviously not what i had bargained for , and i considered ditching this wrong purchase , but instead i figured i 'd give this weird stuff another chance at some other time br br do you realize that my mortal soul could still have been saved , at that point \? \? br br it was only in the next few days that the addiction set in i found myself longing for more of that flavor when the bag was through i would n't have reckoned at first , that i would actually buy many more of these bags on purpose br br now my willpower has been eternally challenged my stomach will never be like before my jaw is numb from the endless compulsive chewing and i can just feel my teeth desintegrating right when i take another dose why do i forever ache for that soothing acidic taste \? they 're so delicious they ought to be outlawed ! . 
never gave much thought to this treat until marshawn lynch came to town awesome have a big ole candy dispenser at work with a big seahawks sticker on it now we have matt flynn beast mode cajun style . 
i 've always , always loved skittles ! they are sweet and chewy , and they will give you plenty of cavities if you 're not careful ! br br enjoy them , and buy this 3 5 lb bag today ! br br 4 5 stars . 
my title was my reaction when i first opened the box it came in i did n't really plan on eating the whole bag since they are mostly gonna be used as reinforcement to get my kids potty trained my two year old girl does n't really care so much but they work wonders for my four year old with autism i give her one after she potties and washes her hands and she could n't be happier i do find myself reaching in and getting handfuls at times but i try not to go overboard if you love skittles than this bag will probably be good for you but if you are just a casual candy eater than maybe not . 
i have an interesting relationship with skittles when i was about 10 years old , i absolutely thought they were average at best and could n't understand what everyone loved so much about them too sour , not tasty enough was my impression later however , i entered my teenage years and it actually took until i nearly graduated from high school that the taste caught on with my tastebuds and became super delicious to me what also got me hooked is this kid i remember from 10th grade science class who would always bring in a bag of skittles every single day and chew on them , and all the girls liked him because of his good looks and smooth personality , so skittles sort of gave me the impression that cool kids eat skittles however , please buy bags of skittles from your local grocery store it 's not worth it here on amazon with the high dollar price you can find plenty of places in your area selling them for cheaper prices my only complaint with skittles is that , despite the color , they all taste exactly the same to me ! purple , green , red , orange , yellow i really ca n't taste a difference between these supposed different flavors then again , i do n't have a favorite color in a rainbow so maybe this makes perfect sense ! . 
i just love skittles ! for a while we had them here in brazil \( south america \) , but then for some reason i could n't find them anymore , so when my aunt is coming down for a visit i ask her to bring me some this time i decided to spare her the shopping trouble and i bought it through amazon and had it sent to her place the bag was a bit larger than i expected , but i guess this was a good thing , right \? . 
so this bag of skittles is really worth it comes with a load of skittles filled too the top of the bag skittles is my favorite candy now i order the 3 5lb all the time its enough to share and still have a lot left over . 
there is n't much to say other than the delivery was great and the candy was fresh and chewy eating alone the bag lasted me 2 months great for the price and i 'd order again ! ! ! . 
i ordered these because i couldnt seem to find this size at the store there were a couple skittle shells at the bottom of the bag from the shipping of the product , but everything else was fine . 
the add on program makes this a great deal for a natural , very tasty sugar br br you can add to any order over 25 or buy 8 \( like i did \) and have all 16 delivered free either way an outstanding value ! br br there are lots of good reasons to eat natural sugar i use in my coffee and making bread use 1 to 1 instead of white sugar for your needs you may find that yeasts will proof faster and more bubbly with this type of organic sugar br br the zip loc bag does not seal all that well so i store in a quart mason jar in the dark cupboard each bag is sightly more than one quart the balance is added to the sugar bowl br br give this sugar a try hope you enjoy it as much as i do ! . 
i buy syrups to make soda with plain seltzer water , and this one is by far the absolute most delicious one i have found this particular flavor is incredibly true to a real red grapefruit flavor , yet sweet and powerful what 's great is that the flavor works whether i want just a little or a lot , depending on how sweet i want my soda to be on any given day it 's comparable to squirt fresca , but honestly i think the actual flavor is much richer and more satisfying if you like the taste of grapefruit even a little bit , you wo n't be disappointed . 
i love goat cheeses and buy them on a regular basis a lot of people seem unaware that there are many other types of goat cheese on the market other than the ultra fresh chevre i have purchased this selection by igourmet for both myself and for others as gifts the reactions from my friends have been mixed they all enjoy the harder chesses , such as the goat cheddar and the ibores however , some people do n't like fresh , soft goat chesses and one of the reasons that i send them this selection is so that they can try a variety of different chesses however , in the selection that i was sent it contained two versions of chevre type cheeses including the delicious buche de chevre still , i wished they had more of the harder to find goat milk versions of cheeses traditionally made from cow 's milk such as the goat 's milk cheddar and gouda br br as for as price goes , this is a surprisingly good value you are getting two pounds of very expensive chesses for a little more than i have paid for one pound of some of the varieties here one of my friends did receive a substitution for one of the chesses instead of the cheddar they received the cypress grove 's midnight moon i can certainly understand why substitutions would be necessary and i felt that they replaced the listed cheese with an even better variety overall i am very pleased with both the price and the quality of the cheeses , i just wish that they had less fresh and more unique forms of this wonderful type of chesse br br a href http www amazon com gp product 1423603680 goat cheese a . 
ordered this goat cheese and it is just fantastic ! i ca n't digest cow milk so finding these goat cheeses was a great treat ! i would order them again they are that delicious ! looks spectacular on a cheese platter with fruit and selected crackers . 
mine came with a wine soaked variety thats purple i have n't tried yet , the cheddar is delicious and melts smoothly marigold \( actually has marigold bits in it \) very nutty , earthy soooo tasty my favorite so far and the bouche de chevre mmm runny creamy delicious ! i have never been disappointed by any of the igourmet cheese selections even if its different than pictured this is no different ! . 
this soup is like a combination of vegetable , lentil and spanish rice soups it has a slightly gelid texture , though i never add as much water as i should 4 5 stars to be exact . 
tried this in a turkey burger and it was sooo good i definitely recommend faery free salt can be added or better yet add a sprinkle of goya adobo . 
it would n't be very smart to replace real veggies with these veggies straws but if you want a healthier salty snack i personally ca n't think of a better one on the market the portion size for 130 calories is absolutely gluttonous one portion is equal to 38 straws that is quite a bit of snacking for 130 calories these are crispy and taste great there is no trans fat , no preservatives , and kosher certified the single serving does have 7 grams of total fat and 11 carbs eating these all the time might not be great for your diet but when you want something this is fantastic option i have lost 92lbs in the last year and half by following a sensible diet and i am happy to say this brand of veggie straws has helped me along the way . 
someone grabbing a bag of veggie straws may mistakenly believe veggie straws are made primarily of vegetables other than potatoes in fact , a quick read of the back of the bag reveals they are made primarily of potatoes and flavored with tomato and spinach this explains why they taste so much like potato chips the texture is light and crisp , and while it 's been many years since i 've had pork rinds , that 's what i think of when i bite into these straws br br sensible portions is the name of the company a 20 ounce bag contains 20 servings , which is about 38 straws each serving has 7 grams of fat compare that to a href http www amazon com gp product b0071byok8 frito lay baked ! ruffles original potato crisps a , which contains only 3 grams of fat per 1 ounce serving br br if you can overlook the fat content , veggie straws are actually quite tasty , and they do have that psychological edge with that name i feel like i'm eating healthier , even when i'm not . 
my kitties love these other goodlife treats are good kitties adore these beg and plead for them i think they must be addictive for cats . 
my dog is 12 years old , and his breed \( powderpuff chinese crested \) is very subject to gum disease and tooth loss after the last visit to the vet , with surgery that cost 13 of his teeth , i have struggled to find him a food that he could eat , that he liked , and would maintain his weight , his energy level \( very playful pooch ! \) , and be good for him he does n't like soft food , so it 's been a real task br br this food does it it 's not brittle or dusty it is shaped like pellets \( almost like rabbit food \) and breaks really easy it 's tasty , cause he scarfs it right up , and he also has managed to get some weight on him he looks better than ever before i can at last rest easy knowing he is getting a decent nutritious food . 
i have a fourteen year old chihuahua who is missing half his teeth he has always been a dry dog food grazer who enjoyed picking out a piece or two of kibble and taking his time playing with it a while before he ate it but he got where he could n't chew the dry kibble , and for many reasons the canned wet dog food was not working out this bil jac senior proved to be the answer he is able to have the comfort of food in his bowl all day like he 's used to , and he can actually eat it when he 's hungry i am grateful for this product because we are both old dogs who are pretty set in our ways . 
both of our dogs are fed bil jac my older dog , dixie , loves this senior version it 's nutritionally dense , with meat as it 's primary ingredient and without empty fillers and fats dixie 's weight is easier to maintain with this formula , and she has the most marvelous shiny coat too . 
i 've had the other nana 's no gluten cookie bars in berry vanilla , and they are n't that good but , the chocolate munch flavor is good they are more moist , have a good flavor and a little crunch the only reason i'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the texture is a little bit crumbly i will be buying these again . 
i agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote in their review i gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick this is because i have severe allergies to wheat and soy pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants so when i found nana 's cookies i was as happy as can be yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it 's better than going without cookies it also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious if you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are a very welcome addition to that diet . 
i actually tasted the berry vanilla flavor if you 've ever eaten a fig newton , then try to imagine a fig newton , minus the fig center , with rice crispies mixed up in it it tastes a little grainy at first , but once i read the ingredients and realized that the grains were puffed rice , i was more at ease really a good taste one of the better gluten free casien free egg free cookies i 've eaten . 
i have to disagree with the other review here ! i love the little bits of crunch in these otherwise really soft cookies i love the banana taste , and i love these cookies ! it 's so nice to have a a gluten free cookie option that does n't suck ! i totally recommend these ! . 
my daughter who is type 1 diabetic and has celiac loves these cookies have had a hard time finding them in the local health food stores so was so happy to discover them on amazon so bought 2 cases of them so now there is enough for the whole family . 
i have a 3 year old and a 9 year old that love these ! the best thing is that they are healthy they are vegan , so no dairy , eggs or other animal products they are also fruit juice sweetened and made with whole grains absolutely nothing artifical they have little chocolate chips in them and taste yummy ! i'm so glad that amazon carries them because they are much cheaper to buy by the case then at local health food stores or through the company website . 
i crave these day and night best cookie brownie bar i have ever tasted not too headache y sweet , but a rich cocoa flavor with a really great texture they hit the spot wish they were at more grocery stores ! . 
i have a 7 yr old w food allergies and both he and my 3 yr old love these i have compared to several other cookie snack items made with no dairy eggs and i think we all liked these the best definitely a must have for restricted diets . 
i love love love these cookie bars i ca n't have any sugar or any gluten and happened upon these at whole foods what a saving grace ! the big cookies are also excellent , but i would eat the whole big cookie at one time these little bars are perfect . 
i have celiac disease , and i try to keep the refined sugar to a minimum , and i was suprised by how good these are ! the light crunch is a shock at first , but is tasty it is a tad dry , so i am only giving 4 stars but the taste is great considering how healthy it is ! ! . 
my kids love these and i feel good about giving them to them they 're all natural and sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar we like to pop them in the microwave for about 10 seconds then they taste like fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookies yum . 
my 3 year old son was just diagnosed with allergies to wheat , egg and milk i was so upset when i found out but a little relieved as i started finding foods he can eat yes , they are crumbly but they taste good , my kids like them and they meet his new dietary restrictions since the option is not giving a 3 year old cookies i do n't mind some crumbs ! . 
nana 's cookies are good eaten plain they are a bit crumbly compared to cookies made with wheat flour br br the cookies are individually packaged i find it better to cut the plastic open with scissors to avoid breaking the cookies br br if you want the cookies crumbled , just break them up in the packaging and then cut open with scissors to dispense neatly br br i like to cut up strawberries and crumble a nana 's cookie over them with a little whipped cream , it 's just like a good strawberry shortcake they are great crumbled over bananas , too br br despite being somewhat fragile nana 's cookies from amazon usually arrive intact . 
let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten free world , baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the glue \( gluten \) that holds them together taking this into consideration , nana 's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar br br at only 130 calories , 4 5 grams of fat , and 7 grams of sugar \( natural fruit sugar \) , the nana banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults the amount of banana is just right , and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside br br each cookie measures approximately 3 5 inches long by 1 5 inches wide perfect for a light snack or dessert , especially for kids amazon has the best price around on nana 's cookie bars , so rest assured that you are getting a good deal , even though they are pricier than regular cookies made with corn syrup and sugar br br good cookies are n't cheap , and cheap cookies are n't good ! give nana 's banana cookies a try \( no , i do n't work for nana 's but am a happy , loyal customer ! \) . 
my 2 year old eats the chocolate munch cookie and loves them i bought them not because they were gluten free , but because they are sweetener free he calls them chocolate treat , if that gives you any indication of how good he thinks they are i would definitely recommend this flavor to everyone i have found that with the subscribe and save discount i can get the boxes cheaper on amazon than in stores like sunflower , sprouts and whole foods . 
these cookie bars are great for packing in a lunch or having alone for a snack try all the flavors for a variety . 
i love these banana cookies even though i can eat any other brand ingredient yes , the texture is different , but that 's what i really like about them it kind of reminds me of mexican wedding cookies dry , melt in your mouth texture they are really expensive compared to name store brand cookies , so i have to maintain my self control and eat only one every few days \( . 
i tried the nana 's bananas cookie bars for the first time this week i love them ! i do n't have any gluten issues so i ca n't speak for that , but i really enjoyed the real banana taste of these cookies some people complained about the drier texture , which i will admit is a little different than an actual cookie , but it i always have it with something to drink anyway so the drier texture is not a problem for me the cookies are nice and soft and there are little delicious crunchy bits in the mix i bring them to work for a nice afternoon snack \) i will definitely be buying them again soon ! . 
lots of double fudge cookies ! what could be better \? i bought these because the texture and taste remind me of the cosmic brownies i ate when i was a kid , the super unhealthy ones by little debbie nana 's fudgy wudgy cookie bars are so much healthier and pretty darn close to the real thing \( without the fudge topping \) they are delicious and a healthier blast from the past for me ! yummmmm ! . 
my daughter is very picky , but she like this cookie very much i have n't seen any product gfcfefsf this good great product . 
my 3 5 yr old daughter with autism loves these ! she is on a special gluten free , casein free and soy free diet and these are a wonderful snack for her . 
my 9 year old daughter has celiac disease , and these are one of her favorite cookies \( other than the ones i make ! \) they are a great quick snack for her to bring and have on hand so that she doesn't feel left out or deprived when cookies are offered to kids in social situations . 
these are the best ! what a wonderful way to provide a treat for yourself and your kids knowing how healthy and pure they are the taste is excellant and satisfies that sweet tooth highly recommend that you try these . 
very tasty and the perfect size snack reliable in availability and shipping time . 
these were good for a snack but found it a little expensive for the size they come in . 
the berry vanilla is one of my favorite from nana 's i also like the chocolate munch when i am wanting something with a chocolate flavor they are dry amd crumble that does n't bother me i have been gluten free for five years and have tried near everything nana 's has become part of my weekly grocery list they are easy to take on the go i think these would be great for parents with allergic children because they are packaged for on the go it can be frustrating to be out and you suddenly get hungry and there is nothing gluten free to be found . 
since i cannot eat sugar , and there are so few healthy options out there , this is perfect for my chocolate fix ! . 
our daughter has several food allergies , so nana 's chocolate munch cookie bars are perfect ! out of all the gluten free cookies out there , my daughter just loves nana 's no eggs , no dairy , no refined sugar , no hydrogenated oils , no cholesterol , no casein , no soy , no corn they are made from natural ingredients and sweetened with fruit juice br br now , do n't get me wrong , for the average person these do not taste like a regular cookie i do not personally like the texture , but the chocolate flavor is good i will say that this is a wonderful product for people with food allergies , but not someone who can have regular cookies . 
we have a two and four year old and they enjoy these cookies br good tasting br very convenient packaging \( individually wrapped \) great for stuffing in glove compartment for emergencies br br the right size for our kids br no bad stuff br no complaints . 
these cookie bars are fudgy and yummy and tasty and healthy and br so good ! ! i am a big fan of these when i order a case of these i always think , man that is a lot of cookie bars ! i am probably not going to be able to finish them all probably being the operative word well low and behold \( with the help of my husband and 6 year old daughter \) they are gone quickly and we are ordering more if you are adding more whole wheat to your diet , these work if you are looking to get rid of refined sugar in your diet , these work if you order them and do n't like them you must have been one of those really picky kids that grew up to be a picky adult ! they are fabulous ! to eat them is to love them . 
my 8 year old son has numerous allergies plus autism and these cookie bars are a life saver ! they 're made with fruit juice as opposed to cane sugar , so i do n't feel bad about giving them to him we 've tried many gluten free cookies , these are by far his favorites ! unfortunately the local stores do n't keep them well stocked , so i'm glad i found them here if you 're not used to gluten free products , you probably wo n't like them the texture is very different than wheat , but if you have n't had wheat in quite a while , these are very tasty and not as crumbly as other gluten free products they are fabulous cookies and i'm so glad nana 's makes them do n't ever stop ! . 
i was excited to find nana 's line of gluten free cookies , and have tried all the varieties that they offer of the various flavors and styles of cookies , these are my favorite i find their individually packaged cookies \( the large , round ones \) to be way too heavy for one meal and end up splitting them for two snacks these 8 pack cookies are the perfect size for a little snack or to keep in your purse i can understand why some reviewers might not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste , and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals i happen to like the berry crystals , and it 's nice to eat a cookie that you do n't have to feel dietary guilt over ! a great hearty cookie that goes well with coffee or tea also , i am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever in my opinion , a good product however , because it is natural and does n't have preservatives , the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging , the better i have noticed that nana 's cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around , even sealed probably a good idea to try this product before buying a case of it , because i have noticed that people either seem to love or hate the nana cookies . 
they are fabulous and not bad for you , what else could you ask for ! . 
they taste great and are healthy we keep our home stocked with nana 's cookie bars . 
when i found out two of my children were allergic to dairy and eggs , it was quite an adjustment fortunately , we found nana 's fudgy wudgy bars fairly soon after their diagnoses the kids think they are delicious , and i love them as a parent because they are a bit healthier than most treats they are also conveniently packaged so that if we go to a birthday party , the kids can just grab a bar , and take it with them so they are n't left out when cake is served i give a package to their teachers too at the beginning of the year so that if there are any special occassions celebrated at school , my kids still get their treat the fact that my kids consider them a special treat , they must really be yummy , although i have yet to try them myself btw , we tried a few other flavors of nana 's bars and cookies , but this one is the only one my kids like \( or should i say love \) . 
the most awesome cookies on the planet we need a treat that is not full of sugar and nanas fits the bill for us . 
i love it ! it 's strong enough to start at least 10 gallons of wine , yet light enough to be flexible , very important for pushing the lid down inside for a sanitizing solution future models should come with calibrations so you know how much liquid is inside but that was easy to overcome with a sharpie and a measuring container . 
i got disgusted with the garlic powder sold in bulk at health food stores and natural food groceries it rarely has much garlic flavor and was way too hot and the quality was very inconsistent at stores that did sometimes sell something good br br i'm now half way through my second jar of tone 's , which is consistently excellent it has a strong garlic flavor and is not hot unless you use a lot on something like broccoli it is way better than raw garlic cloves they must have an excellent source of garlic for their powder if you have doubts about your current garlic powder , smell it if it does n't have a strong garlic smell , it 's just white powder get this tone 's and you 'll get your delicious food back . 
i used to buy this product at the local walmart , but they no longer carry it it delivers more garlic flavor per ounce than ordinary garlic powder , and i use it whenever fresh garlic is not practical on my burgers , in potato salad , etc . 
the garlic granules make cooking with the garlic flavor without adding extra salt the tones quality is exceptional arrived quickly . 
my 9 1 2 month old daughter has loved this since she tasted it when she was 7 months i have tasted it , and it 's delicious it 's convenient for on the go or to have handy as a snack the ingredients are mangoes and lt 1 organic lemon juice the consistency is nice and thick \( like that of apple butter \) so it is n't dripping off the spoon also if you feel confident enough , you or your child can squeeze it right in his her mouth ella 's products are expensive , but i think their products are worth it , and my daughter has loved every variety we have tried except the pumpkin combo love all the fruits pears , apples and these mangoes this also provides 40 of vitamin c . 
my baby loves this it 's a great first food to start with when teaching your baby to have solids the pouch makes it easy to get the product out , without making a mess and the lid is easy to refasten , so you can use it again over a few feeds . 
this is excellent for a baby 's first taste the pouch size is perfect and it actually lasted me two days , as my baby is still just learning to eat solids , therefore did n't have it all the top makes it easy to refasten , so it does n't go to waste and can be used again i love the pouch , it 's easy to get all the product out wihtout making a mess .

no matter how wholesome a snack may be , it 's worthless unless the girls approve in this case they both give the science diet jerky treats two paws up i like that beef is the first ingredient in the recipe and there are none of those unrecognizable ingredients created in a science laboratory br br the treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy for piper , our shih tzu with a few missing teeth , i break the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them br br on the package br use within 3 weeks of opening br 100 satisfaction guaranteed br keep this bag out of the reach of pets and children . 
at first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack to be fair , this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair by the third and fourth and subsequent offerings , the hesitation stopped though the girls genuinely like these treats now , there is n't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries br br i like that the first ingredient of these snacks is real beef \( not the undesirable artificial beef \) , and they are made with natural ingredients the treats are small and chewy and are good for training , rewarding , and bribing for most dogs the consistency is probably perfect , just enough chew to add interest for piper , our shih tzu with a few missing teeth , i break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left br br science diet backs these treats with a 100 satisfaction guarantee . 
i'm usually a caffeine guy , but i had to switch to decaf while my wife is pregnant this is definitely the best decaf out there full flavored , smooth , and very aromatic it 's the best ! . 
i got this product a while back it was very delicious i love trying to cook korean food i would recommend this product for those who are people new to cooking korean food the hot pepper paste came in perfect condition . 
this is wonderful stuff , exactly what i was looking for of all gochujang pastes available , this one is spicy sweet , with a wonderful depth of flavor a good addition to soups , stews , sauces and marinades , occasionally i just eat a spoonful straight from the box ! it 's a good topping for noodles and rice bowls , too . 
i love all of joray 's flavors watermelon is my favorite ! joray 's fruit rolls are more natural than other fruit snacks . 
these are delicious they have the same consistency as a spree or runt , and they are sour all the way through i'm sure i 'll be ordering some more . 
this candy is similar to the cry baby tears that you find in the boxes only , as the seller mentions they are coated which does n't seem to bother me one thing you want to keep in mind unlike the individually boxed cry baby tears these ones do not contain the grape flavor great candy it 's too bad that this is so hard to find in stores . 
my wife uses this coffee in our espresso machine to make cappuchinos with cocoa powder and it is great she says it has a nice strong coffee flavor but smooth not bitter i do n't drink coffee but i took some to work for the drip machine there and several of the coffee drinkers love it . 
our two golden retrievers have been on beneful weight control now for at least 3 years we did n't see any out of the ordinary pooping problems that others mention they love it and both have lost considerable weight both were considered obese , but now one is normal weight and the other is only slightly overweight my only real complaint is they stopped selling it \( at least around here \) in the larger 40 50lb bags now you can only find these 31lb bags but the price is the same we go through about 2 bags a month , so it 's a little pricey . 
i put all my dogs on this food about a month and a half ago i began to notice my older overweight dog become more playful and energetic he has already lost some weight also all of the others have more solid stools and they actually enjoy eating this i would recommend this to everyone . 
this is one of my favorite potates dishes but i always have a tough time finding them in my local supermarkets so , like usually , i go to amazon and sure enough , they 're available at a much lower price in a shipment of 6 boxes as i know they 'll be gone in no time \( my family loves them too \) i put them on automatic delivery no more searching the supermarkets , love it ! . 
these are very good they are very close to home made , but when i'm in a hurry , i really appreciate having them at hand . 
i was amazed at the actual taste of this product the amount of protein and the lack of fat is really good they have a lot more flavors and all of the combinations are really good . 
i purchased a keurig so my husband could make just one cup of coffee for breakfast instead of making a french press full and pitching half of it i use it to make unsweetened iced tea with the plethora of sweetened iced tea k cups , it 's great to have one with the good , clean and fresh taste of unsweetened tea i use the largest setting and then add about 1 2 cup of cold water to the pyrex liquid measuring pitcher with the addition of water , it cuts the strength to the proper consistency i do n't bother with all the glasses with ice and then brewing over ice i just make the tea and pour it from the pitcher good stuff . 
this tea makes extremely dark and strong tea on the 11oz setting which is my largest water capacity setting i use the keurig iced beverage tumblers filled with ice and ca n't drink it straight my solution is to fill a gallon pitcher with ice , add some water , make two iced brew k cups and pour it over the ice water for what i consider perfect iced tea you can forego the water for stronger tea , or add more water to dilute the tea depending on your mood or tastes this tea has excellent flavor , it 's just too strong right out of the keurig for my tastes and in my opinion requires diluting excellent for making a pitcher of tea ! . 
great taste there is a slight bitterness to this tea , but it 's black tea it 's bound to be a little bitter , especially for being so strong the strength is perfect for customizing to taste some people like strong tea while others like theirs very mild , so you can add more water if you want i like to make a fairly strong tea \( the melting ice dilutes it just fine \) and sweeten it myself i like sweet tea , but usually when i get it , it just tastes like sugar water these give me the strong tea flavor i love , and i can add the perfect amount of sweetness great product ! . 
this is definitely too strong if you make one glass from one k cup i 've experimented now i run two k cups through the large cup brew three times each i add each cup to a pitcher then i add enough water to fill my three quart pitcher i sweeten it with stevia , and add juice from one lime great iced tea ! . 
great tea i have checked other stores ie target , kohls and they are more than this tea costs plus the boxes you get on amazon are bigger quanities . 
the best , tastiest and fast making ice tea by the glass , does not leave an after taste , like a delicate summer breeze in a glass , fresh ice tea anytime of day or night , great for company . 
i prefer to sweeten my own tea and so this is perfect it makes a strong cup of iced tea , and some may choose to add more water after brewing easy to make and great to have around taste is very good . 
i love my keurig and especially like to fix my iced tea with these kcups they are very flavorful and every glass is fresh brewed ! i drink iced tea all year so i a glad i found an affordable optuion ! . 
i ordeed this product because this tea is really good the shipment came as expected i love the taste of this tea it 's not stong at all . 
i adore these k cups ! on a keto diet , it can be hard to find pre made drinks that are n't loaded with sugar with these guys , i can control the sugar content but still enjoy that perfect glass of iced tea . 
i have two chihuahuas and they absolutely love their little bites ! the ingredients are the best quality available organic chicken , flax seed , nutra drops , and tons of vitamins and minerals ! the best part about this food is that toy breeds can be on this from the time their little puppies til they 're full grown for life ! try finding another dog food that does that ! this is a must if you have a toy breed dog it helps balance their glycemic index even at the most stressful periods of time overall , it is just a really healthy food that will make your dog look and feel beautiful inside and out ! . 
i ordered this assorted bartons turkish delight 6in1 it is delicious i took it to my parents house for my sister 's birthday among her gifts which i also bought at amazon everyone at the party loved this turkish delight so much they even wanted to buy it for them and i told them amazon go there they have everything , amazon thank you as allways bringing us international flavors without leaving our homes . 
we have a 3 year old maltese that we used to shower with greenies \( 1 2 a day \) even though it says to limit them to one per day the last time we took him to the vet , we told her what kind of food he 's on and what kind of treats he gets she was concerned with the amount of greenies he gets and told us to limit them to one every other day she said that greenies contain wheat and that could be problematic for dogs later on in life so i searched on amazon for a wheat free dental chew br br our dog has tried three different kinds of dental chews \( including this one \) and likes them all he 's tried a href http www amazon com gp product b001g96uk8 greenies dental chews for dogs , teenie pack , 96 chews a and a href http www amazon com gp product b001mwrt18 zuke 's z ridge mini carrot fresh breath dental chew bones , 15 count pouch a br br after reading mixed reviews , i decided to give these a try my first impressions were that these were pretty large for a small dog they are twice the length of a greenie when our little guy got one , he ate half of it , then tried to hide the other half he did like it though i will say that he usually devours his greenies but he takes his time on these \( he did the same with the zukes at first \) after a few days , he seems to really like them br br if you 're doing a side by side comparison between the get naked dental chew , greenies and zukes , i think these are better they 're really low in calories and they 're wheat free , corn free , soy free and gluten free they 're cheaper than zukes as well br br my recommendation is to cut them in half that will give you 36 treats for your dog per bag three bags will give you 108 treats vs greenies 96 at around the same price he likes the zukes but they are just too expensive seeing how you only get 15 per bag br br i suggest buying one bag to see if your dog likes them if they do , then they are a great alternative to greenies . 
my four year old chinese crested mix loves these dog treats he is somewhat of a picky eater when it comes to dog treats but he loves these they smell nice and minty and take a little while for him to eat so it gives him something to work at they are made with good ingredients no meat byproducts or corn ! and they are made in the usa which is definite plus i will continue to get these for my pup . 
my dogs really like these my six year old adopted spoodle came to us with bad teeth and a weight problem she had 14 teeth pulled and is halfway to her weight goal , and has learned to like crunchy snacks br br my ten year old lab likes anything , but also needs to watch his teeth and his weight br br i like to give them a treat before i leave the house , so that they are happy instead of anxious when they see me get my coat and keys br br these treats are perfect at only 18 calores each , and the dogs are excited to eat them the lab makes short work of it , but the spoodle gets to give her remaining teeth a workout christinejw . 
my dog has many food allergies , but these made in the usa treats are free of wheat , corn , egg , and dairy my dog ca n't get enough of them . 
my dogs love these ! ! when i ran out of them recently , they were counter sniffing trying to find some i have a service dog that has to maintain his weight , and these are perfect for him . 
my dog really enjoys these and they do not last long she is not a big chewer , and does n't like bones , so i wanted to get something that she could much on from time to time so to help clean her teeth i was attracted to these because they are low calorie and made in the us when you get them out of the package they do n't look like food , but the dogs do n't really mind they are flexible enough to cut in half with kitchen shears if you have a small dog . 
these are great treats ! my dog is older and has a few extra pounds so i decided to buy these for her she loves them also keeps her occupied for some time while she is eating it . 
i have a larger breed of dog , about 90 lbs and she loves these at first they seem kind of hard , but she has no problem eating them they do n't take her very long to finish , but they are a nice little snack or treat for her while still being healthy my moms smaller dog , about 12 lbs also likes these , although the smaller ones are best for her . 
my dogs loves them glad to know that i have found a snack that is appealing to my dog but also something that wo n't have him breaking the scales ! . 
my dog really enjoys these treats and the plus is that they help keep his teeth clean too will definatly purchase these again . 
i just got these and my dogs love them , they smell pretty good and their breath is a little better smelling they are excited when i open the treat jar and they see these yummy treats i like them for the low calorie and better breath . 
these dental sticks are perfect for my two dogs that have food allergies and they love them and i like the price for them here at amazon . 
my dog absolutely loves these ! i try to give one to him everyday , either in the morning or before we go to bed at night it does n't take him long to finish it off but long enough to put dishes away or brush my teeth \) . 
my dogs are very tiny and i needed a chew that would have the benefits of teeth cleaning but without any weight gain , and these did great , plus my dogs enjoyed them if a dog does n't like the taste and wo n't chew on a dental stick , then it would defeat the purpose so these fit the bill all around . 
i was skeptical that my dog would chew on these treats , but he does seem to like them they smell like cinnamon and are very low in calories my mini dachshund suffered kidney damage after contracting leptospirosis he is on a special diet of rice and a small amount of protein dogs on these diets often suffer from dental disease i needed something to clean his teeth , but also not introduce high protein to his diet these chews are 18 crude protein , much lower than other chews , and contain fiber \( chia seeds and flaxseed \) and antioxidents like green tea a win win situation for my dog 's overall health . 
i'm a runner doing 30 50 miles a week and am currently \( 9 10 \) training for the chicago marathon i 've tried all of the gels and chews that are out there and these are my favorite i do n't like gels as that squirt of mush activates my gag reflex plus you always need water with them i 've tried all of the other brands of energy chews \( i think \) sharkies \( good but sticky and not very tasty \) , clif shot bloks \( nice package , very sticky on the fingers \) , gu chomps \( super sticky and caused some nausea \) , powerbar gel blasts \( very good but tough to chew if cold \) the honey stinger chews are very easy to chew and you do n't need water they do n't stick to your teeth either the main selling point for me is that they taste good and do n't cause nausea no matter what i'm sticking with these ones . 
they 're not as compact as gels like gu , but these are great for marathoners i empty 2 bags into a small plastic baggy i carry the baggy in a neoprene pouch br br i try to eat about 2 chews every 1 5 2 miles , beginning at mile 4 water to wash them down helps , but is n't a necessity easy to eat on the run good consistent and natural energy and electrolytes no stomach upset , which i always got w gu . 
when i'm riding and hit the wall where my legs are just out of gas \( glycogen \) i can eat a pack of these chews and within minutes feel relief and renewed energy ! i never go on a ride without them oh yeah they taste pretty good too . 
these are tbe best fruit chews i 've ever had ! the flavor and texture is great my son had these last summer for the first time when he was at the boy scout ranch , philmont , in new mexico he , of course , said this as a real treat while he was there i'm so glad i found them on amazon ! well worth the price a great value ! . 
great seller the product was as described the seller shipped the product quickly good , fair price honey stingers are by far the best training race day nutrition you can buy they taste great , easy on the stomach , and organic i love them . 
i hate to just echo everyone else , but these things br really are that good like a lot of folks , i had n't br heard of these before backpacker magazine br raved about them in april of '09 br i gave 'em a try and was blown away br br over the years i 've found that i find food br on long hikes less and less appetizing br especially when the temperature is over 90 br the thought of chewing and swallowing is br not appealing br br obviously some nourishment is still necessary , br but i came to dread powerbars , and then next , the br tastier bars they spawned so i switched to gels , br but after awhile , i came to dread those , as well br but these little chews are delicious i 'll eat them br even when nothing else sounds good br between hikes , i keep them out of sight , because br otherwise i 'd snack on them at home br i'm on here now ordering another dozen for a big hike . 
i ca n't stand gu anymore so i found these for me , i feel like i got much more energy and so much better tasting these taste as good as any gummi candy out there sometimes during the week i 'll open a package and eat a few every day before my workout , and i really notice the extra energy towards the end of the workout . 
these are really good ! ! ! also , be sure to try the cherry blossom flavor if you can that one tastes absolutely wonderful ! ! this does n't stick to your teeth at all and it has a very pleasant taste and even smell to it one pack has just enough pieces great to bring along when you 're traveling i gave some to a 7yr old and she loved it ! because it 's not too sweet \( none of that dreaded corn syrup in here \) , people of all ages would easily approve of this i certainly do and would not hesitate to recommend this to everyone ! . 
they have a great fruity flavor they are pretty sweet but you can taste the honey in them and the sweetness doesnt overpower the fruit flavor the texture is perfect , not too gummy like gummy bears that you have to chew forever but also not stick to your teeth like sharkies kinda like gum drops and there 's lots of them in a bag so you dont feel like you got cheated i think i like these more than any other sports chews i have tried they also dont leave your fingers sticky after handling them i hope they come out with new flavors . 
these energy chews are absolutely delicious ! they hold up really well in your pocket or backpack when you 're backpacking or mountain biking ! i really could n't imagine eating any other energy chew ever again ! . 
these honey stingers are great i 've used them a handful of times on runs lasting over an hour they do seem to provide some much needed energy they 're easy to chew , taste great , do n't stick in my teeth or make me extra thirsty , and the packet is small enough to be portable i really like that the ingredients are pronounceable and healthy enough \( organic tapioca , cane sugar , fruit juice , etc \) br br however , i do n't see how they 're any different from organic fruit snacks \( like annie 's bunnies \) , which i can get much cheaper in a multi pack from my local wholesale club the ingredients and nutrition information are virtually identical for that reason , i gave them just 4 stars . 
they taste so good easy on my stomach when i am running help keep my energy up on long runs love them ! ! ! . 
these taste good kind of like cherry koolaid 95 organic ingredients make it a bit healthier than koolaid better than the clif bloks \( i say that b c the cola clif bloks have a medicinal after taste \) . 
i love these things unlike other products , this actually tastes really good i would recommend this to my family and friends . 
a great pick me up when exerting energy i eat these while biking honey base is apparent in the after taste , but is n't over powering the chews are great tasting and provide energy without caffeine . 
my kids love these ! they have a great flavor and , for us , are preferred over sharkies my daughter sometimes gets stomach aches from fruit snacks , but has had no trouble with these . 
we do a lot of bicycle riding in the heat and longer rides as well we do n't want to crash from lack of carbs in our system other energy products do n't taste as good as these do they are conveniently packed in little pouches so they are easy to grab and take along when we ride good stuff ! . 
heard about these from a triathlete who said that they worked fast an avid hiker , i have used other energy gels with limited success taken about 15 minutes before an uphill climb , they provide the extra boost you need the chews have a great texture and taste like gummi bear candy highly recommended . 
i ordered these to use for marathon training i have a sensitive stomach , but have had no problems with these they do give me energy during those long runs ! . 
these organic energy bites are delicious and work great i use them for golf tournaments or long bike rides a few bites every half hour and you will have ample energy for hours of activity . 
i'm not a fan of messy gels , or stopping for powerade during a race when i do my own long runs or if i'm doing a half , mess and inconvenience factor aside i also do n't want to consume junk these are organic and contain honey , and while soft squishy somehow do n't get stuck to each other when shoved in a gel pocket during a run the taste is so delicious that my son tries to swipe them as well ! . 
i tasted a few of these and they are pretty good i was expecting something a bit flavorless and i can imagine happily snacking on these for a multi day packing hike i will write more after i have taken them on the trail . 
tried the pink lemonade flavor today during my long run unbelievably awesome tasted great , no stomach issues , no sticking to my teeth , water not required to wash it down and most importantly it was the best run i 've had in a long time ca n't wait to try other flavors . 
i start popping a package when i can feel that wall coming on these are easy to open while cycling and give a decent boost within a relatively short period of time as always , organic is a definite positive not a lot of water is needed to get these down and i have n't had any heavy stomach feelings after consuming them very happy with this purchase and will get more when this case is gone . 
i'm training for my first marathon in november 2011 and these chews have kept me going during my long 18 to 20 mile training runs i dissolve them in water rather than carry them as chews and sip steadily after mile 8 they taste like concentrated hawaiian punch and do not upset my stomach whatsoever i also eat them prior to a workout if i am feeling low energy and will even snack on them in lieu of candy seriously , they are that good i have tried gu as well as powerbar gels and both do the trick but are nowhere near as tasty the consistency of the chews are slightly softer than dots candy . 
stingers are better tasting and more convenient than gels and work just as well to provide energy when exercising over long periods of time . 
i was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running i am 60 years old and about 50 pounds overweight i find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising first of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary i was surprised though to see that the ingredients were n't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup i guess with the package calling it honey stinger i was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers still , everything is organic which i suppose should add to it 's value i found that i felt no energy boost during my activities but i can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going it 's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going i do n't like feeling like i'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that i think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising the only drawback to me is the cost of these 16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them i will purchase again when my grocery money allows i would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy pickup to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost . 
these energy chews have a great flavor , will give you good energy before or during a workout , and are a reasonable price i would recommend this to any endurance athlete such as a cyclist , runner , triathlete , etc strength training and sports nutrition for cycling . 
i did n't want caffeine , do n't want the high calories went through many types of energy chews gels drinks online to see what would be the best option for myself br br i love the honey stingers ! no caffeine , calories can be controlled depending on how many pieces you take , and most importantly , it lasted me through my marathon trainings \) br br fruit smoothy is delicious have n't tried the other flavors . 
i use honey stinger energy chews on all my long distance bike rides i ride over 100 miles a week and love all the different flavors . 
last fall i bought a slew of different protein bar brands to see which i liked the most of the many brands i tried , most all were roughly the same in taste , texture , etc but these honey stingers stood out to me they have a much smoother texture , and have a great sweetness to them that really makes them taste great i'm a huge fan gonna by a bunch more boxes for snacks and workouts . 
yo soy corredora , y he probado muchos tipos de productos , este es el que mejor resultado me ha dado . 
when i opened the package , i only found 11 packets of the honey stingers there should have been 12 i counted and re counted 4 times to be sure the packets were in a thin cardboard display box , wrapped in a sealed plastic bag , and shipped in a sturdy cardboard box i do n't really want to go through the hassle of returning the item , so i guess i'm out a pack it 'd be nice if amazon shipped me one more packet ! \) . 
these are the most awesome little energy snack possible ! brought a box of these on a hunt for a week with some buddies for the first time along with a box of sharkies prior to this , sharkies where our mainstay when needing a boost and energy replacement have to say , even the sharkies fan in the group had to admit honey stingers fairly surpassed sharkies in both taste and performance will still probably bring both next time for variety , but definitely twice as many honey stingers honey is the perfect food ! . 
if you have been out to philmont on a treck or as staff these are given to you in your trail meal they are organic and made of honey they good and healthy a . 
i had gotten a box of malher hilachas style sauce from my mother and set it aside for a rainy day well , today it rained i mixed the package with water , added rice , some peppers , onion , chicken and potatoes and let it simmer my entire family just loved it even my picky grandson ! now , i want to find more ! ! ! ! . 
the box is very impressive so i had high expectations \( especially when it comes to chocolate \) br the combination of chopped up nuts and small pieces of dark chocolate is brilliant unlike anything i have tasted before amazing flavor somewhere between velvet \( chocolate \) and crispy \( nuts \) made me feel almost relaxed weired br yesterday , i had it for breakfast , instead of granola , with milk it was really good i did n't crave food and i did n't snack until mid afternoon i am impressed . 
i have to agree with several other reviews here that state the the switch orange tangerine is too sweet on it 's own i ended up making a cool summer drink out of the can that i tried served over ice mixed with soda water it was fantastic ! the soda water ice mixture helps cut down on the sweetness and improves on the refreshment factor br br a little more about the switch the can claims that this product is 100 carbonated juice with no sugar added and no preservatives one can is 8 3 fluid ounces and provides 140 calories total sugars per can are 34g 36g of carbs one can provides 100 of the daily recommended dose of vitamin c br br that being said , i ca n't see myself drinking the switch everyday even without preservatives and added sugars this drink still packs in a lot of sugar in every can though to be fair , i rarely drink soda or sweetened carbonated beverages still , for a nice alternative to the standard soda i recommend the swtich the tangerine flavor is reminiscent of tang . 
for those that want a more natural soft drink , this is a good option because it has no added sugars it still manages to pack 140 calories in an 8oz bottle so do n't drink this regularly if you 're trying to lose weight the taste has good complexity but like most fruit drinks , is a little too sweet for my taste i would definitely drink this instead of a typical artificial orange soda though . 
here we have a refreshing drink , not one you 'd want to drink three of in a row but just one for a picker upper or to quench an urgent thirst br br the flavor \( orange tangerine \) is subject to peoples' personal tastes but i liked it okay it 's not the best drink i 've ever tried but it 's okay for something different people will have to make their own choice as to whether to buy it or not in regard to the price br br unfortunately , either the manufacturer , the amazon vine people , or both , goofily \( is there such a word \? if not , i just invented it \) placed two useless stickers on the can which covered half of the nutrition facts on the can there was plenty of space to put them elsewhere but some non thinker failed to use his or her marketing sense so all i can tell you on that topic is that there is a 1 sodium content , total carbs are 30 grams , and there are 140 calories per 8 3 ounce serving \( 1 can \) br br i would n't buy this product but that 's chiefly because i normally drink only non sugar beverages . 
not too sweet , not overly carbonated can be best described as a good orange punch mixed with perrier and while it is all natural , it is also reconstituted br br and that 's the rub , while tasty \( tangerine is the most prevalent flavor with hints of white grape and a slight grapefuit finish \) , this is basically just expensive , carbonated juice can size is the same as a red bull , 8 3 oz versus the industry standard 12 oz serving br br is more better \? not necessarily , but then again sometimes less is just less at approximately 2 per can , which category the switch orange tangerine is , is for you to decide . 
this tastes great and i like that it 's more natural than most other sodas available basically , it 's a carbonated juice i generally prefer a larger 12 oz size though . 
i enjoyed the taste it is close to orange soda initially but then there is another sweet taste at the end of each sip but unlike orange soda , this is healthier and no added sugars even though this product tastes like orange soda i think it would do well for breakfast it may even become preferred over traditional orange juice for children and for businesses that worry about short shelf life on the downside , the price is a little high for such a small can when buying 24 . 
while switch orange is very orangey , it also tastes of something else interesting it 's fizzy \( but not , in my opinion , excessively so \) and tasty , and i 'd consider buying it i seldom buy or drink soft drinks or sodas i just do n't care for all the fizz burning my nose switch did n't do that hurray ! ! ! . 
hubby and i both shared the dring and we both liked it i really liked the fact that there was no added sugar in this drink it 's a nice combination of flavors i found it a little too carbonated but he thought it was just right br br i would buy it if it came in a larger can hence only 4 stars i think this can is too small too much aluminum thrown out i recyle everything but most people i know just toss it otherwise i would buy this drink . 
i drink too much soda i 've started looking for alternatives and one of the things i 've tried is switch i first tried it because while it 's like an orange soda , it 's really carbonated juice br br i like br the carbonation br the flavor br all juice br no added sugar , no high fructose corn syrup br no artificial flavors or colors br br i do n't like br the small can \( 8oz \) br the flavor took a can to get used to it it 's a mixture of orange , apple , tangarene , grape , and acerola juice \( acerola is a fruit high in vitamin c , so i assume that 's why it 's used \) if you do n't expect exactly orange soda , the flavor grows on you quickly br br if i really want a cola , switch is n't good enough to be my replacement but it 's a very easy replacement for an orange soda i ca n't wait to try some of the other flavors i usually really like black cherry drinks and i'm interested in seeing what fruit juices they use in that one ! . 
it is so hard to find a nice juice drink that is either too sugary or , even worse , has additives like artificial sweeteners the switch orange tangerine delivers on flavor if you like juice and want a full flavored orangy carbonated fizzy drink , this one fits the bill very good ! . 
refreshing and light a little on the sweet side but not overly sweet i enjoyed the orange flavor ! . 
i am not one for canned juice drinks , but this one was exceptional in flavor i am also not a big fan of orange flavored drinks but the tangerine is distinctive and nice it kind of reminded me of one of my favorite soft drinks in the world , ting \( from jamaica \) which is made from real grapefruit juice very nice , if you need more vitamin c in your life i would consider buying it . 
everyone at my house , even my mother in law , enjoyed this drink it tastes very much like a quality soda , but is made with 100 real juice small cans mean you do n't consume a lot of calories at once , because although this is healthier than regular soda , you should n't drink too much it 's still a lot of sugar . 
perfect size can and a refreshing drink i think it 's proof that simple is best this would be my first choice for a drink if i were out and about . 
i like the taste of this drink in many ways it takes me back to my childhood with the orange ice lollies i used to eat as it has a similar flavour the thing you should be aware of is that although it has no added sugar because it has so much fruit juice it does have a lot of calories i also found that the can needed to be bigger as i wanted more at the end ! . 
switch definitely managed to keep its carbonated juice drink 's intended flavor fresh though just a combination of sparkling water , the juice concentrates of several fruits \( including apples , grapes and oranges \) and , oddly enough , soy , it definitely maintains its taste of tangerine br br i 'd love to see what other flavors switch has to offer , with my only hesitation coming from natural flavors and colors but , hey , i'm willing to grant them a little leeway in that department thanks to the no high fructose corn syrup ! . 
it 's very refreshing to find products without sugar added , but make no mistake , this tiny can still packs a solid 34 grams of sugar , enough to give you an energy rush followed by the typical adrenal fatigue crash perhaps you can sip just a few ounces every few hours to avoid the crash \? br br the flavor is very good and will tempt you to chug the whole can in one quick drink not exactly a health drink , but it 's a nice improvement over the usual junk sold as a soft drink . 
nice alternative very lightly carbonated i 'd say if a normal carbonated drink ranges from 80 to 100 on the fizzy scale , this one 's about an 11 br br at 26 grams , it 's still a lot of sugar \( mostly from apple and grape juice , i think \) i 'll order a case just 'cuz i thought it was good and i'm calling it 4 stars but honestly , i 'd rather have it 50 splenda or stevia sweetened . 
after taking my first sip of switch orange tangerine , i raised a suspicious eyebrow because it did n't taste the way i expected it to then it dawned on me that my mouth was prepared for more of a fake , amped up orange soda , but what i was tasting was real , natural juice yes , i knew that from the label , but that 's not the same as experiencing it br br the taste was a nice blend of orange and tangerine , not too sweet , and the carbonation adds a nice touch a bit like a non alcoholic mimosa cocktail br br my only reservation is that the calorie count is \( perhaps unavoidably \) too high for me to drink this on a regular basis though let me be quick to point out that this is a no sugar added product for those who are n't counting calories , a nice refreshing switch from soft drinks ! . 
this drink is a nice blend of juices \( mostly orange \) and carbonated water there are no other ingredients it has a decent amount of natural sugars from the juice , so it is not a low calorie drink i thought the balance of flavors and sweetness was quite nice and would definitely buy again . 
in the beginning there was fruit juice , and there was soda pop , and never the twain should meet unless you mixed them yourself but then somebody got the great idea when reconstituting fruit juice after pasteurization , why not reconstitute it with carbonated water \? thus was born br br soda juice ! br br and i tasted it , and it was good ! frankly , i found black cherry , kiwi berry , and watermelon strawberry pretty similar in taste , orange tangerine more distinctly tart , but i enjoyed all of them br br in the cans you have 5 other flavor choices a href http www amazon com gp product b001lg940e the switch black cherry , 8 3 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a , a href http www amazon com gp product b001lggh2c the switch fruit punch , 8 3 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a , a href http www amazon com gp product b001lg943g the switch grape , 8 3 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a , a href http www amazon com gp product b001lggh40 the switch kiwi berry , 8 3 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a , and a href http www amazon com gp product b001lggh54 the switch watermelon strawberry , 8 3 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a br br since virtually nothing is added , the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used fruit punch , orange tangerine , and watermelon strawberry have the highest calories , 140 kiwi berry is next , 135 black cherry is next , 130 and grape has the lowest , 125 orange tangerine and watermelon strawberry have the highest total carbohydrates , 36g black cherry and fruit punch are next , 35g kiwi berry is next , 34g and grape has the lowest , 33g finally watermelon strawberry has the highest sugars , 35g fruit punch and orange tangerine are next , 34g black cherry and kiwi berry are next , 33g , and grape is the lowest , 32g br br note all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice all contain acerola , apple , and grape juice in addition to their title juices kiwi berry contains raspberry and strawberry , and fruit punch contains cherry , lemon , and pineapple orange tangerine also contains soy br br compare and contrast a similar product is worth considering a href http www amazon com gp product b0014wyy1e izze all natural sparkling juice , apple , 8 4 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a , a href http www amazon com gp product b0014wyxyw izze all natural sparkling juice , blackberry , 8 4 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a , a href http www amazon com gp product b0014x5o1c izze all natural sparkling juice , clementine , 8 4 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a , a href http www amazon com gp product b0014wyxtc izze all natural sparkling juice , grapefruit , 8 4 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a , and a href http www amazon com gp product b0014wyxqk izze all natural sparkling juice , pomegranate , 8 4 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a the difference \? the izze products are fortified with vitamins b6 and niacin in addition to c and have roughly three fifths the calories , total carbohydrates , and sugars of the switch products . 
i'm not sure what i expected maybe something thin and bubbly but switch delivers a rich , full orange tangerine flavor br it 's got a lot more flavor , and good flavor at that , and a bit less carbonation than other carbonated fruit drinks br an 8 ounce can has 140 calories , no fat , 15mg of sodium , 35 grams of carbs , 34 grams of sugar \( they claim no sugar added \) , and no protein it also contains 100 of your daily requirement of vitamin c and 20 mdr of vitamin a br i tried it chilled with breakfast and thoroughly enjoyed it . 
this product is like orange juice that is fizzy it reminds me of another product , izze , but this product is slightly sweeter and is n't as carbonated as izze i would recommend this product , just make sure it is cold because it tasted alot better cold than warm . 
i put my orange switch in the refrigerator overnight to make it nice and cold , and i had it with breakfast i love the taste of it mostly orange , with a hint of carbonation it tastes sweet naturally and i'm sure it 's good for you i would buy this product \) . 
it really is ! i am not a fan of carbonated drinks because most of them are simply not healthy i even know people who have developed physical problems because of too much consumption of them , especially those who even drink them as a starter in the morning br br but this one is different it has a real full bodied orange tangerine flavor , although the label says it is combined with other juice concentrates apple , grape and acerola juice \( i had to look that one up it is the cherrylike fruit of a small tree of the west indies which has a high concentration of vitamin c \) anyway , it 's just darned good ! br br i experimented a little on the best way to serve i drank it cold as is , then poured it over a glass of ice cubes neither of those ways seemed quite right then i poured the beverage on ice , left it for a minute , then removed the ice by pouring juice through a strainer this left it nice and chilled , not just cold , and not weakened by melting ice br br i live in the colorado desert where temperatures are scorching in the summers orange juice does n't quite quench my almost constant thirst , but has been the best thing available to me until now yes , i will definitely switch to switch , forgive the pun ! br br it 's actually good for you too hope one day it will be in all schools . 
i liked it ! br br did n't know what to expect it has a variety of fruit juices such as apple , orange and grape , but clearly had a strong orange taste i liked the fact there was no added sweeteners such as hfc or sugar i'm not a pop soda drinker , but i think if i served this instead of the traditional orange stuff in a 2 liter people would n't notice the difference br br it 's a bit pricy for orange soda and i'm sure orange juice would be better , but if you are looking for something healthier , this one 's for you . 
this is a very good tasting carbonated juice drink that makes a great alternative to soda there is not an overload of carbonation just enough to make it taste more like orange soda br br it 's made with 100 juice \( more apple and grape than orange , surprisingly \) , it has 100 rda vitamin c , it 's all natural with no sugar added , no corn syrup , no preservatives , no artificial colors , and it 's gluten free br br the flavor of the drink i tested was called orange tangerine , and it was an 8 3 fl oz can , with 140 calories and 34 grams of sugar br br the only reason i did n't give it five stars was that i really cannot picture myself paying for it it 's rather expensive in comparison to the orange juice i buy at the grocery store , and if i want an alternative to regular soda i would go with a href http www amazon com gp product b001htir6c blue sky jamaican ginger ale , 12 ounce \( pack of 24 \) a now , that is good ! however , if you 're looking for an orange flavored soda substitute this is your product 100 juice how could you go wrong . 
with the new fad of making sodas that are good for you too , we have plenty to choose from in the drink isle switch 's orange tangerine has a great taste , a fruity nose and is refreshing but with the same calorie content 140 as a can of coke well , i'm sticking with coke had switch produced this product calorie free like a href http www amazon com gp product b00247d46e nutrisoda immune , tangerine lime , 12ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a it would gain a greater market share with established soda drinkers while switch offers 100 rda of vitamin c , the nutrisodas pack on extras without padding our bodies . 
this is a very refreshing carbonated juice drink with no aftertaste i love the flavor and the fact that there is no added sugar it 's more subtle than orange so really kills a thirst the size is perfect for times when you do n't really want a 12 ounce drink . 
there is gum acacia in the list of ingredients not sure if it adds anything to the flavor the orange and tangerine flavors do come through the fixx it seems to be a bit sweeter than orange juice have achieved more satisfying and natural tasting fizzy juice drink by adding sparkling water to oj . 
i really like this drink my only complaint is that i 'd need to drink 2 3 cans at a time 8 3oz is a wee bit on the petite side for me br br if it came in a 20oz can , i 'd be much more likely to buy it , and the packaging would be much less costly br br really tasty product , though , and i 've got no quarrels with the ingredients yum . 
boy , i really loved this drink br br it tastes much like orange soda , only with no oddball aftertaste it 's plenty sweet , but the sweetening is so naturally orangey that it does n't seem overpowering like a coke can it 's much smoother and easier to swallow than a conventional soda , with carbonation that is plenty strong , but not quite as strong as a can of crush br br it 's a drink that is subtle not only in tone but in flavor you can taste the various other fruits mixed in with the tangerine and orange , but it 's still very much an orange drink with no fruit punch aspirations br br it tastes perfect , and there 's no doubt that someone carefully went crazy saying 'too much ! ' 'not enough ! ' to every little facet of the drink before it was just right br br no corn syrup or other bad additives at 36 carbs per 8 3 ounce serving , it 's still got quite a lot of sugar in it if you 're looking for an orange soda style drink that is really just carbonated juice , this is the best possible product i am quite sure . 
i enjoyed this drink it has a tangy citrus flavor which tasted a little less orangy than i expected , but was still good i liked the carbonation in the juice it was about the right amount for me the drink has about the same calories as a regular soda , but i feel better about drinking it because of the natural ingredients the drink does not have the syrupy feel of a traditional orange soda which is a bonus this is definitely a lighter tasting , very refreshing drink the only reason for reducing the star value by one was because of the price which is a bit extravagant for me i recommend this drink . 
silly me , i did n't read the packaging terribly closely i was actually rather pleasantly surprised basically , it 's carbonated fruit juice from concentrate , or as they say 100 juice \( filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates , apple , grape , tangerine , orange and acerola cherry juice concentrates \) br br gone is the usual second ingredient in such beverages high fructose corn syrup or the old standby sugar br br basically , it reminds me of a carbonated version of tropicana pure or one of the odwalla beverages , watered down just slightly \( not quite as sugary , but still pretty darned sweet \) br br overall , i rather liked it it 's a bit smaller than your typical pepsi or coca cola can but i could see it being handy for kids' lunches and such slightly better than typical soda with corn syrup though i'm not sure whether it would be preferable to straight up fruit juice br br personally , i 'd rather have the fruit juice \( like a hansen 's smoothie or something , granted they 're a bit sugarier \) but some folks like carbonated beverages so , why not make one out of actual fruit juices rather than all sorts of more artificial stuff \? br br rather liked the orange tangerine one i'm interested now to try some of the other flavors and see if they 're as good especially a href http www amazon com gp product b001lggh40 kiwi berry a but possibly also a href http www amazon com gp product b001lggh54 watermelon strawberry a or a href http www amazon com gp product b001lggh2c fruit punch a . 
this is almost the kind of fruit soda i 'd make if i were going into this business the difference is that i 'd go the odwalla route and not use reconstituted juice concentrate and only use orange tangerine juices since it 's a carbonated beverage i 'd probably use a stabilizer too so it would n't have to be shaken before drinking that would result in a higher price , though not sure how much higher than the almost 1 can price it 's being offered as a grocery item \( imagine the price in a vending machine \) br br for this product the first ingredient is apple juice and the second is grape juice , then comes the tangerine and orange juice and finally acerola juice \( a fruit high in vitamin c and apparently popular in puerto rico and barbados \) there 's acacia gum \( as a stabilizer probably , do n't want to have to shake a carbonated drink \) and then additional natural colors and flavors , ascorbic acid and soy br br my 13yo daughter and i shared a can and liked the taste on a par with orangina my personal preference would be for a little more carbonation , but this was ok i'm a traditionalist so i definitely prefer a 12oz can , the quantity at this price makes me feel a little ripped , but then , i prefer to make my own lemonade in the blender adding in some raspberries or strawberries or mint to vary the flavor cheers ! . 
no sugar added br no preservatives br 100 juice carbonated br all natural br br but it tastes just like soda br br if you are a soda lovers , but want a healthier alternative , this may be just the ticket it 's an especially great product for kids , because they really think they are getting soda , but without all the added sugars ! . 
my daughter thinks this tastes like sunkist orange soda , my grandson likes it and drank the rest of it \( most of the can \) i thought it was okay \( by i am not a fan of orange sodas \) i would undoubtedly like it better in another flavor , like grape , or fruit punch , or kiwi berry br i think this is , of course , a much healthier alternative to any regular soda and judging from my dautgher 's and my grandson 's experience with it , it would be hit with most kids . 
our family , wife , 2 year old and 4 year old , have had other switch sodas in the past , and liked them quite a bit they had a bit of an apple flavor overrode the main that 's definitely not true for the orange tangerine it tastes almost like fresh squeezed orange juice with bubbles far better than orangina or orange soda br br my kids kept asking for more sips of the soda throughout dinner , and we all have enjoyed it i appreciate that there 's no caffeine , and it 's all natural , so i have no problem giving it to my kids i 'd definitely recommend buying the soda , we 'll keep some around the house regularly . 
4 stars is a compromise between my rating of 2 and my grandchildren 's rating of 5 stars i thought the flavor was too heavy on the apple grape juice combo and light on the orange tangerine flavor also , it left a mild , canned aftertaste but my 9 year old granddaughters loved it and consider it a treat equal to soda it is 100 juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water , so it is much healthier for them than regular soda while it is true it still has sugar , natural sugars from the juices are healthier than processed sugars found in soft drinks the can i was sent contained 8 3 ounces which is a better size for them than a regular 12 ounce can of soda for children , this is a tasty and healthy alternative . 
i do n't know how to describe 'switch orange tangerine' without sounding like a cliche advertising slogan , but the truth is it really is very refreshing just the right amount of carbonation too this stuff tastes like what you would get if you squeezed part tangerine and part orange and then poured in a bit of sparkling soda very fresh tasting not too sweet at all the label says there is no sugar added fine , as it doesnt need any the label also says it has apple and grape juice i taste mostly the tangerine myself but you may find your mileage varies finally , it is supposed to give you a full days worth of vitamin c ok , a lot of drinks can do that nowdays , but without any refined sugar of high fructose corn syrup \? \( or artificial sweetener \? \) i could totally see replacing my orange soda with this stuff i have not seen this in the market yet , but i would be willing to try other flavors and add switch to the many beverages i enjoy really , for a fruit drink , it is pretty darn good ! . 
there 's nothing wrong with this drink , but it really just tastes like any other orange soda kudos to the switch for not adding artificial flavors , sugar , or corn syrup , though it tastes pretty clean and refreshing , but a bit expensive for what it is br br do n't let the small sized can \( 8 3oz \) fool you , this is n't an energy drink , it 's just an orange soda . 
i was really looking forward to this beverage , as i love tangerine juice and the thought the combination of orange , tangerine and carbonated water would make for a great soda br br i have to say , it is different , but not what i expected while it was different than a typical orange soda , i did n't find it that different , either in sweetness or taste i probably prefer it to traditional orange sodas and i believe it to be vastly superior to many supposedly natural sodas , but i was surprised how similar it really is to artificially flavored drinks a bit more \( maybe a lot more \) orange and tangerine juice would be good . 
i have always been a fan of premium beverages and sodas i will never buy pepsi or coke products at a minimum i will by jones because they use pure cane sugar i really enjoyed getting to try this product , and i am actually going on now to start ordering it on a regular basis br br you can really tell the difference between pop and juice with sparkling water it is a bit on the sweet side , and i did not think they needed to add the extra juice flavors to make it just right however this is a great product , good size for individual servings , and it arrived in good packaging by amazon . 
if you 're a regular drinker of orange soda pop , you might like this switch orange tangerine carbonated juice beverage i thought the flavor was very good and appreciated that it was only mildly carbonated , not so fizzy that i had gas after drinking it at 140 calories per small serving , however , this is n't something i would regularly drink it 's much healthier to eat whole fruit since it 's more filling that simply drinking the extracted juice , in part because of the fiber associated with eating whole foods still , this is a healthier option for those who regularly drink sugared sodas . 
my impression of the switch beverage was good overall br br i was curious to see how good it would be after all , its not difficult to add some club soda to your own orange juice for an identical benefit at a lower price br br the taste is fairly good it is heavy on the tangerine flavor its a bit syrupy , with a high carbonation typical of many european drinks i 've had br br the juices that comprise this beverage , in order of quantity , are br apple br grape br tangerine br orange br acerola cherry br br needless to say , i think it would be difficult to mimic the exact flavor at home , due to the mix of the 5 juices they have overall , you probably will be pleased with the drink certainly , the canned beverage is more convenient than mixing your own , which is impossible if you are on the go br br i will probably be buying more of this product , however , i did not find the flavor to be so compelling that i would recommend it heartily to a friend . 
i am a die hard soda pop fan i will drink juice but normally only certain brands or with a little soda \( 7up or sprite \) mixed in to kill the after taste and to sweeten it up a bit br br well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda it has a crisp , clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after taste it is effortless to drink and does n't make you feel sluggish afterwords it is hard to describe other than to say they got it right no extra sugar , yet it is very sweet , but not too sweet br br i shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments 100 we both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case ! br br while i am not sure it could replace my coke , it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake the only problem \( there always seems to be something \) is that it is about 4 times the cost of my coke per oz i could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason i have n't ordered more so far i do expect to breakdown and buy a case , but i still wo n't be happy over the cost difference . 
this is a wonderfully refreshing citrus drink not too sweet or too sour just enough bubbles to make it sparkle i would imagine it could make a great addition to a punch , if you chose to add it to your favorite fruit juice the only draw back for me , is that it is a tad bit too expencive to replace our families normal beverage of choice but it sure does make a terrific treat to keep around for an occational indulgence . 
very nice drink i enjoyed it , especially when it was chilled the flavor is powerful but not overpowering i loved the bubbles great drink . 
i enjoyed the flavor of this orange soda it was not overly sweet and the orange flavor had just enough tartness to it i am glad it does not have any hfcs in it , but the calorie count is still quite high from the natural sugars all in all , if you are looking for a good orange soda , try this one . 
this drink is very good especially after a long hot workout it quenches the thirst without all the added sugars and preservatives i highly recommend . 
this has great flavor , but i am not sure it would be a soda alternate i am thinking it would be good for a lunch or mini fridge at work ! tastes great , but i really did not get the carbonation kick i get from a soda . 
note i tried the watermelon kiwi flavor first , and this review provides comparison to that flavor as well as unique information br br design packaging i really like the can size it 's narrower than a soda can , but the same height as a soda can it fits very nicely in my hand , and i could easily toss one of these in my purse or daypack br br nutrition the calorie and sugar count seems high on this drink , but if you compare it to the nutrition of the same amount of pure , unsweetened grape juice , it 's the same calorie and sugar count , plus or minus 10 \( it 's worth noting that grape juice is the first listed ingredient , so this makes sense \) thus , they 're probably not adding sugar or calories to the juice to make the drink the thing is , you probably should n't down ten of these a day , but one can as a snack or pick me up seems reasonable br br flavor here 's where switch fell short in the watermelon kiwi flavor , but i was pleasantly surprised to find that this flavor was refreshing and delicious it was not overly sweet like watermelon kiwi i'm also very impressed with the flavor it 's like a less sweet orange soda , except that it 's with real juice instead of artificial sweeteners i think this would be a great mixer as well as a nice snack beverage . 
i tried two flavors of switch the orange tangerine and the watermelon strawberry i liked the watermelon flavor a lot , but found that with orange tangerine , the flavor of the can came through a bit too much it reminded me of why i 've never really enjoyed drinking canned orange juice still , it was fairly good and the carbonation made it light and refreshing both flavors were a big , big hit with my 8 year old son . 
this stuff taste just like flavored carbonated water br in this case flavored with orange and tangerine br i imagine it 's better for you than plain soda br i really found it tasty it has a strong citrus flavor br that i preferred to some of the other flavors . 
i like sparkling water a lot perrier is usually my first choice but sometimes i want something a little more then the fruit flavored seltzer water this drink fits the bill nicely it contains all natural fruit which is a big plus over the fruit flavored options it contains some calories but since it is from a natural source and not just plain sugar , i'm okay with it this beverage is in a slimmer can with only 8 3 oz versus the usual 12 ozs of say , a can of soda so you save a few calories but not much it hits the spot when i want something sweeter then plain mineral water and it 's healthier then soda br br i 've tried other sparkling fruit drinks with lower satisfaction marks most of them claim to be all natural but list funky ingredients such as natural flavorings huh \? this beverage lists ingredients that are easily defined also , it avoids the overly sweet taste of other similar produts this one stands out as a winner but less calories would make it perfect i guess you cannot have everything . 
our family is a huge fan of izze and this was right in line with that the flavor was not too sweet and refreshing my favorite way to enjoy this was with some ice and vodka obviously that 's only for those of you reading this that are 21 yrs or older ! . 
i also got the cherry one and this is just as good it 's a break from soda or water or coffee i really liked the light refreshing taste and it does n't fill you up like sodas can it 's very very tasty and it had a very fresh orange taste , not artificial tasting i really liked it . 
we are big izzie fans , but we were excited to try this sode we were very pleasantly pleased it is a very orange taste , delicious and it feels good to know there is absolutely no sugar so , when our children want a soda we serve this and they are delighted it 's a win win ! . 
i repeat , carbonated fruit drinks can be too sugary this drink reminds me of other orange soda brands without the extra sugar that combined with the metallic can always leaves an odd taste in my mouth orangina has a bit more flavor , but switch tangerine orange is light and refreshing , . 
if you love orange soda but do n't want to drink soda this is the perfect product for you this taste just like orange soda but is actually made of 100 real fruit juice no joke it really tastes good i loved it br br however just b c you do n't have all the fake soda ingredients it still has tons of calories for 8 3 ounces 140 to be exact a can of soda has 150 for 12 ounces so i am not sure what the trade off is unles you want 100 of your vitamin c ! . 
i love everything about this drink it 's got plenty of carbonation even without added sugar or artificial sweeteners , it 's plenty sweet , without being too sweet i love tangerine , and this has a very tangerine y flavor and aroma if you love oranges or tangerines , this is the perfect drink for you br br i ordered this from the vine program out of curiosity , but it will be one of my must buy items in the future i'm also going to buy some for my grandchildren since it has no added sugars , and i know they 'll love it , it will be perfect for them . 
living in germany for several years , i acquired a taste for apfelsaftschorle or schorle for short , apple juice and sparkling water the soda water cuts the sweetness , gives the juice a little tang , and makes the drink a better hydrator the juice makes the soda water a little more interesting i usually drink any fruit juice this way now br br switch premakes my schorle the blend was and orange citrus rather than apple , but very good regardless i tried it straight , but it would have been better over ice or if it had been mixed with a little more soda water and a little less juice the ingredients were juice , sparkling water , and a couple of stabilizers , without two of my pet peeves artificial color , especially red 40 , and high fructose corn syrup br br i enjoyed it and can recommend it as an excellent alternative to conventional soda br br e m van court . 
the switch orange tangerine is one of the most refreshing drinks that i have ever tried it is 100 pure orange and tangerine juice and the difference from the regular sodas is quite obvious right from the first sip it feels richer and tastier than any soda product out there after drinking it , you may never go back to regular sodas again it works well by itself or with a meal this may be an ideal substitute for sodas for kids , as it is a much more nutritious drink the only problem that i have is the size of the can at 8 3 ounces it may be enough for a kid , but you would need more than one of these to quench an adult 's thirst . 
no harsh after taste , no tangible negatives it just does n't have the bite that i crave from other carbonated beverages like ginger ale or root beer it 's a good option for a healthful drink with some fizz . 
i think sodas are a big waste of money that said , i had the opportunity to try this and it is divine ! ! ! . 
i thought the drink was delicious , but too sweet i mixed it half n half with sugar free ginger ale and loved it , however , i rarely drink sugared drinks you need to make a sugar free version . 
this drink has a wonderful orange citrus flavor it is robust but not too strong a great natural alternative to soda my 13 year old likes it as well would not hesitate to purchase . 
i really liked the tatste of this it actually tastes like you 're getting the juice from a tangerine i think the carbonation gives it that zing taste you can only get biting into an tangerine , orange , etc br my daughter , however , really did n't like it not sweet enough for her br i think it 's a little pricey , not sure i 'd be willing to plunk down that much for it the can is very small , 8 3 fl ozs , which is a proper serving of orange juice , which makes it around 1 a can , or a little less br but overall i truly enjoyed that zinging tangerine taste ! ! . 
this carbonated 100 juice drink tastes incredibly good ! it reminds me of eating fresh tangerines when i was a kid , yet this is a drinkable version of that ! if you like oranges and tangerines , you 'll love this ! these ought to be in every school vending machine \( instead of sodas ! \) br br this is made from 100 juice , so great for adult \( or kids' \) lunches , picnics , etc a great drink for exercise as well , and does n't have the sugar in it , so no spikes in blood sugar likely a good choice for diabetics as well , and without the artificial sweeteners ! . 
i say all these reviewers who say this stuff is too sweet are wrong ! have it on the rocks ! the melting ice will water it down just right i tried four flavors and here is my ranking br br 1st place a href http www amazon com gp product b001lggh40 kiwi berry a br 2nd place a href http www amazon com gp product b001lggh54 watermelon strawberry a br 3rd place a href http www amazon com gp product b001lg940e black cherry a br 4th place a href http www amazon com gp product b001lg945o orange tangerine a . 
switch orange tangerine soda comes in a smaller can than a regular soda \( a little over 8 ounces , compared to the usual 12 ounces in a regular soft drink can \) it is labeled as all natural because the sugars in it come from fruit juices rather than added corn syrup i chilled the can of switch in my refrigerator overnight , and then sampled it poured over ice in a glass the color is not so neon orange as some orange sodas it is a softer orange color the fizz is also less than in a regular soft drink br br i found the flavor pleasing , with none of the chemical or metallic taste which can occur in many brands of orange soda the soft fizziness of the drink complemented the orange flavor well i did n't really get a true tangerine taste from the soda tangerines are a very acidic fruit , and have a very distinct taste , which i did not really get from this soda however , the taste is very smooth and quite refreshing my teenaged daughters and their friends loved this soda , and i have been re ordering it every so often as a treat br br switch is a bit pricy you can cut down on the price by signing up for regular deliveries , but so far i have n't given in to that temptation however i am buying it for special occasions , for the travel cooler , and for planned teen get togethers . 
this small can of juice is tasty ! the carbonation makes this beverage very delightful , and the juice is not too sugary it is good to see this drink in the market although i would have liked a larger size container so i could drink more at a time , the switch drink is loaded with tangerine goodness ! hooray ! . 
yes , you should order this drink because it does taste great \( as long as price is no object \) br tastes like orange juice with seltzer water br but dont feel guilty about drinking it because it is 100 juice ! . 
i usually cringe a little before i do a natural juice carbonated beverage there is frequently something of an aftertaste that is unpleasant br br this is refreshing , light , very bubbly and leaves a bright taste after with no cringe effects br br i definitely would buy this drink . 
i certainly hope that switch will be selling this product in larger packages i was very disappointed when my tangerine soda was gone it was very good ! actually tasted like tangerines , which was a surprise as most of the sodas on the market do n't have much distinctive flavor at all switch sodas are pleasantly carbonated , sweet without being overwhelming so , and very satisfying , particularly when drunk very cold ! . 
this relatively expensive convenience packaged item is 100 percent juice and contains 140 calories worth of concentrated apple , grape , tangerine , orange , and acerola juice reconstituted with carbonated water acacia gum some soy and added vitamin c to provide 100 percent of the adult minimum daily requirement there are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a natural beverage br br i often mix juice with seltzer water , and i like the combination quite cold the switch orange tangerine tasted more like orange soda with a tangerine chaser than what i am used to as juice flavor br br the carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice , but not as light and refreshing to the mouth as juice and seltzer br br the tangerine flavor made the taste seem more appealing than orange soda , but the orange and tangerine flavors do n't last as long as soda flavors do on the palate br br i would drink this again on a hot day if i could buy it inexpensively enough . 
who knew juice could be so cool \? it has a very refreshing taste and lightness , just the right amount of sweet \( not too much \) switch is an apt name for this beverage i am guessing that lots of folks will be making the switch from cola to carbonated juice once they get a taste of this product line . 
this was actually a surprisingly refreshing drink that is lighter then oj and reminds me of a virgin mimosa there was little after taste and the flavor is n't overbearing like an orange soda the best thing is its all natural with no corn syrup the bad thing is that the size is a little small at only 8 3 oz , which is probably to keep the calorie count down overall , a good , refreshing pick me up , but you may want to drink more then one . 
the can size is like a redbull drink 's however , its sugar content is 34 grams attached is a photo of the nutrional facts br br in terms of its taste , in my opinion , it 's quite tasty , sweet , a bit tangy and very orangish ! . 
to be blunt i 'd call this orangina \( a href http www amazon com gp product b000121by6 sparkling citrus beverage with pulp 4 glass bottles a \) sans pulp basically the drink has minimal carbonation , and a light orange juice flavor with hints of rind zest undertones of grape and apple come across as well being that they are ingredients but i still feel this beverage is distinctly orange compared to the cherry which i tried earlier i feel that this is a far more refreshing drink personally i find this drink to be rather good and fans of orangina should definitely take note . 
i like orange soda but usually cannot drink an entire can or bottle of sunkist or a href http www amazon com gp product b00168a9kg orange crush case 4 6pk a because they are so sickly sweet this has just the right touch of natural sweetness , and the tangerine gives a nice little tang to the orange flavor reminds me of the great orange sodas you can get in europe or specialty shops , like a href http www amazon com gp product b001gn4ohk orangina sparkling citrus beverage with natural pulp 24 cans a or a href http www amazon com gp product b0001fqucg san pellegrino aranciata 6 pack 6oz bottles a br br dare i say it \? yes the flavor and size make it a perfect mixer after my intial sip , i immediately thought it would be great to fill up the rest of the glass with vodka . 
i found this to be a nice alternative to juice and to the usual pepsi that i normally drink br br it had a nice light flavor with just a little carbonation i do n't believe tangerine is the right name for the taste i would say a tart orange juice is more accurate however , the name of the drink does not take away from the quality of the product br br i let my children try a little bit of this and they too thought it was a very good taste br br the cans are small , smaller than a coke can , but i found one to quench my thirst better than any of the caffeinated drinks i would normally pick up . 
fruit juice has lots of calories , so at home , we often dilute grape or orange juice with water or seltzer and ice we like the flavor and the bubbles make for a more refreshing drink the switch is a portable alternative a little carbonation , nice flavor , more like tangerine than orange , and 100 of the daily requirement for vitamin c when convenience is important , the switch is a good , healthier alternative to soda . 
i really liked this drink it provides the pleasure of a carbonated beverage without the sickly sweet , sticky feeling that drinking a soda leaves behind despite containing apple and grape juice , it tastes mainly like the orange and tangerine it advertises if you 're looking for a carbonated juice , i 'd definitely suggest this i 'll be drinking it again . 
refreshing orange juice drink with a good kick to it if you drink this first thing in the morning with breakfast , it 's sure to be a real eye opener ! it 's a juice drink , not soda pop but it is carbonated , so it has the same bubbly , zesty fizz the tangerine taste is better than switch 's black cherry i would definitely buy a whole case of this orange flavor highly recommended ! ! . 
if you want a quick pick me up that is not full of added sugar , then this is a refreshing alternative to a soda the flavor is more heavily tangerine \( which only makes sense \) it is n't overly sweet , which is a good thing . 
i quit sodas over a year ago due to the unhealthiness of them i do , however , like bubbly drinks , but i do n't need the sugar or sodium that 's why this product is perfect it is 100 fruit juice , carbonated for the bubbliness br br orange is one of my favorite flavors this drink is the perfect drink br br i think this product is even better than orange soda orange soda is sticky , but this product is not it has the perfect amount of sharpness which i love because it is 100 fruit juice , it also has the perfect amount of natural sweetness br br so this product is all the good things rolled into one br br 100 fruit juice br no added sugar br bubbly br awesome orange flavor br br it 's so good , it 's hard to believe you 're drinking something healthy . 
if you like tangerine and you think you need carbonation , then i think you 'll like this product no sugar that i could taste to cut through the sourness of tangerine though there was a hint of the orange that helped take the edge off of course if you really like tangerine , i mean you really like it , then you will get more than enough of it in this drink br br we do need to be wary though of claims that natural equal healthy is no sugar added really healthier \? what about the carbonate process that adds the fizzle and bubbles , what are those health affects if any \? much like claims of organic we need to remember that not everything in nature is good for every person there is still a nice chunk of calories here , far more than water if you are allergic to citrus you should n't drink this even though you might drink things like sunkisk br br did it taste good , oh yeah , it did to me because i like tangerine and orange but it did also have a slightly sour after taste that was annoying , easily solved with water since i do n't normally drink carbonated beverages though i felt a bit off after drinking this as well br br this is n't just juice and you should n't make this a substitute for juice or fruit i do n't doubt that it is slightly better for you thank other carbonated beverages though i think it would be better if they could cut some calories out as well . 
like izze , the basic idea here is soda made with actual fruit juice no sugar , no hfcs , no preservatives , no coloring just 100 fruit juice concentrate and sparkling water fruits listed are apple , grape , tangerine , orange and acerola \( whatever that is \) br br intriguingly , the can mentions contains soy at the end of the ingredients list there 's no protein content listed , so it must be a trace amount something to bear in mind if you have a soy allergy , however br br flavor is fantastic i 'd have a hard time choosing between it and izze , but i think i might just give switch the edge . 
switch is a fun alternative to traditional soft drinks it 's 100 juice and all natural it contains no added sugar , no corn syrup , no preservatives and no artificial color what makes it fun is it 's carbonated and just the right amount br br the first sip is perhaps a little tart or bitter , but that 's because most of us are used to soft drinks with added sugar , corn syrup and a bunch of largely unpronounceable chemical compounds switch has none of that and , although different from traditional soft drinks , the taste is very refreshing the carbonation makes it a fun drink that you can feel good about consuming \( it has 100 of the recommended allowance of vitamin c \) br br should coke and pepsi be worried \? probably not , but it does taste good and it 's actually good for you you should try it ! . 
i sampled a can of switch orange tangerine and found it to be a tasty beverage as advertised , it is a balance between juice and carbonated with a light carbonation so it does n't taste like orange crush or fanta but not like orange gatorade either the 8 3 oz can has 140 calories , with a 12 dv carb sugar content but 100 vitamin c and 20 vit a it 's marketed as 100 juice coming mostly from filtered concentrates no sugar added , no corn syrup , no preservatives , no artificial colors , gluten free , if you 're concerned with all that most important is that it tastes good and i would try it again . 
i 'll admit that i do n't care for drinks that are carbonated the carbonation in soda makes me burp , they tend to be too sweet , or the diet drinks have a weird taste to them so i was n't sure what to expect when i drank this br br to my surprise , the carbonation is very mild it 's more like a light buzz in your mouth instead of a lot of carbonation \( you wo n't hear the contents fizz when you drink this stuff \) the orange tangerine flavor is a nice combo stronger in the tangerine flavor than orange , though as someone who does n't like any sugar in my drinks , i found it to be a tad sweet \( though it is advertised as no sugar added \) , but less than i expected br br i'm not sure when you would drink this though it 's a small can and i ca n't imagine someone who drinks cans of soda drinking one of these instead especially at the price they charge for this are they thinking that this will replace a glass of orange juice first thing in the morning \? br br overall i think it 's tasty and if someone offered me one , i 'd take it , but it 's not something i would buy . 
this is a mix of apple , grape , tangerine , orange , and acerola juices br br taste is obviously subjective and that can be seen in the reviews i like the flavor but will try to describe it rather than raving or ranting about it br br the tangerine is the dominant flavor however it is the taste of a very ripe tangerine or , perhaps , a clementine there is that slight alcohol or medicinal overtone to an otherwise good flavor i could see people not liking it while other do br br each can has 34 grams of sugar , 100 vitamin c , and 20 vitamin a and not much else these are n't nutrients that are otherwise hard to get so this is n't necessarily a healthy alternative to regular soda on some level \( e g producing fruit instead of sugar cane \) it might be attractive to some . 
this was a very interesting drink ! it was refreshing , tasty and healthy ! it was very tangerine tasting , no after taste and very refreshing ! . 
this is a wonderful alternative to soda pop it 's delicious , refreshing and most of all , natural i ordered the tangerine orange i'm anxious to try the other flavors my only gripe is that the cans are rather small other than that , it rocks ! ! . 
so , i sampled this switch orange tangerine blend low on the carbonation , high on the orange taste , and worth every sip in gold ! plus , healthy to boot give it a try , and you may discard those brand names once and for all ! . 
i loved it ! good taste , pleasant carbonation , fun can br br ok , so all it is is carbonated fruit juice big deal , right \? but it actually is a big deal if you are a soda junky and want to cut down on the negative effects without losing all the experience i hate diet soda because it just does n't taste right and has way too many synthetic chemicals in it however , this drink has no sugar , corn syrup , or preservatives i suppose the co2 may not be the best for you , but you gotta live a little . 
this can of juice was delicious it reminded me of the orangina beverage i did find it strange that they chose to package this product in a can normally associated with energy drinks like red bull since they market it as all natural nevertheless , it 's yummy and i recommend it ! . 
the switch orange tangerine beverage is a mix of orange and tangerine juices with carbonated water , and , i must say , it tastes amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it 's similar to soda , but without all the unhealthy artificial ingredients and high fructose corn syrup if you find it , buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . 
i decided to try the switch orange tangerine because it was promoted as a drink that is 100 juice , 100 rda vitamin c , all natural and it happens to be carbonated br br the taste is like drinking orange juice at first with carbonation and i have to be truthful , at first i wondered if it was an alcoholic beverage at first br br but after tasting it , you do taste the combination of the orange tangerine and the carbonation br br the drink contains no sugar or corn syrup and no preservatives br br overall , a tasty carbonated beverage with only 140 calories and no fat 15mg of sodium and 36g of carbs br br if you are interested in the beverage that combines the taste of juice and carbonation , give switch a try ! . 
i enjoyed this drink it has good fizz and flavor ingredients include apple grade juices as the main fruit elements tangerine , orange and acerola \( type of wild cherry \) round out the other fruit juices for my taste , this is not citrusy enough i find an orangina to have better flavor , but it is loaded with added sugars \( high fructose corn syrup is the second ingredient in orangina \) ! i also compare this to the izze version and the izze wins for flavor i think the health benefits of the switch or izze drinks outweigh the flavor differences though , and if i was but one of these types of drinks , i would not look at orangina again . 
i love this flavor the best for it lightness , but zesty and orange tanginess very refreshing taste and not over powering with no additives what a plus nice carry size , but why should such a good thing be in such a small size good that the product is in a can recyclable there are other similar carbonated juice out there and this is definitely one that could compete with the low saturated market . 
orange tangerine switch is a crisp carbonated citrus beverage unlike its sugar laden brethren , switch does n't leave a sticky film in your mouth after you 've finished drinking it , presumably because there is n't any sugar added to the drink my only complaint is the price at about 1 per can , you do n't get a whole lot of bang for your buck , especially since you can get a 12 oz can of regular soda for a much lower price i guess that 's the price you pay for something that 's better for you . 
i have long been a fan of mixing juice , such as orange joice , with a carbonated soda like 7up it provided the best of both worlds , fresh juice and carbonation the down side over the last number of years is the high fructose corn syrup that has replaced sugar in the carbonated sodas br br but , of late there have been alternatives first there was orangina , which mixed 12 orange juice with carbonated soda still had the sugar , but far better than mainstream sodas then a number of drinks have become available that mix the carbonation with a high percentage of real fruit juices some of these have been underwhelming to say the least the best so far is izze with its 70 fruit juice and 30 carbonated water no added sugars br br now comes along the switch the switch is 100 fruit juice with carbonation added and , like izze , i really like this drink it is different than izze drinks the switch blends their juices different to achieve a little more subtle flavor where izze has more tang and punch i ca n't say one is better than the other only that they each deliver a different refreshing experience br br i have tried the switch in orange tangerine and black cherry the orange tangerine is very good ! i highly recommend it the black cherry is good , better than some other cherry drinks of this sort i have had , but it could be a bit better it does n't quite deliver the same flavor experience of a really good black cherry soda . 
as part of amazon 's vine program i received two trial cans of the switch , a href http www amazon com gp product b001lg940e black cherry a and a href http www amazon com gp product b001lg945o orange tangerine a i tried both flavors cold \( over ice \) and rated them 4 stars each , although i prefer the orange tangerine flavor to the black cherry br br whether or not the switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda if you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed these are 100 juice drinks the orange tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the black cherry has 130 calories br br i recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout either way , you are getting 100 of your vitamin c and there 's no added sugar or corn syrup , no preservatives and no artifical colors br br the black cherry flavor was too mild for me i was looking for more bite i could taste hints of the apple , grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend the flavor reminded me of blends i 've tasted from treetop again , the switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in a href http www amazon com gp product b0014wyxyw izze fortified all natural sparkling blackberry juice a , for example br br the orange tangerine flavor should be renamed the tangerine orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma the switch 's blend is as flavorful as a href http www amazon com gp product b000bdhbwq essn sparkling minneola tangerine juice a or a href http www amazon com gp product b001l4eme4 san pellegrino orange a although , again , it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands br br in summary , these all natural , 100 juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda the switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and or juice after a workout remember to keep them the cans ice cold , though preferably , serve them on the rocks br br btw if you are looking for a full flavored black cherry soda , try a href http www amazon com gp product b001p9gb4y thomas kemper black cherry soda a , which has 170 calories per bottle there 's a low calorie \( 10 \) version as well but it is n't available on amazon . 
very natural flavor not loaded with sugars and other things not good for you has a fresh taste of orange tangerine and the carbonation is great great taste i enjoyed this product and would recommend . 
and you 'll have a pretty good idea what this tastes like the tangerine \( and or the added flavoring \) provides a nice 'tang' to the flavor i found it to be quite tasty and refreshing i'm not sure why they are packaging it in the small 8 3 oz energy drink size cans , unless it 's to keep the calories per serving down at 140 cal can , it certainly is n't low cal , but there is no added hfcs \( high fructose corn syrup \) or sugar the surprisingly high price is also a downside true , real juice is a lot more expensive than water and hfcs , but at this price , i 'll give it a pass br br pros br good taste , not too carbonated br br cons br small can , expensive , fairly high calorie oz . 
overall , this is a nice , light , refreshing drink the sweetness is a bit sweeter than juice squeeze , but not as sweet as hansen 's soda i tried two flavors this orange tangerine , and the strawberry watermelon i preferred this orange one the flavor was cleaner but , there are so many different juices in both those drinks , it kindof gets muddied i think i prefer juice squeeze because the flavor seems true er my 10 year old daughter prefers hansen 's , because it is a bit sweeter but , like i said , overall , this is a very nice drink no corn syrup yea ! . 
well , this drink was surprisingly tasty the reason it was surprising because there is no sugar added it 's 100 juice carbonated it was like drinking a soda but it was a drink of juice that is carbonated this would be a good drink if you want a healthy drink that is carbonated br br now i'm curious about the other flavors to see if they taste better however , i do have to say if you 're expecting something extremely sweet , this is not the drink to get you may want to go buy kool aid for that this drink has a natural taste to it i can actually taste the mixture of orange and tangerine i wish the tangerine flavor was stronger , because i like tangerine more than orange , but considering the fact that there is no sugar , it 's a good drink . 
this is a nice , light , refreshing carbonated fruit juice it 's something like orangina , but far more natural tasting which makes sense , because unlike orangina , it 's all juice and has no added sweetener br br my only complaint is that the 8 3 ounce can is rather small i generally prefer a larger drink it 's definitely not a bargain if you have to drink two cans at a time . 
i love the taste of this soda it 's sweet with no bitter aftertaste that can be found in some orange sodas i 'd never guess this was a natural drink from the taste alone br br my only complaint would be the serving size it 's correct for a serving size but not what i'm used to in a soda can \( 12 oz \) . 
the switch is marketed as 100 of what you want , 0 of what you do n't meaning , the only things in the can are juice and carbonation there is no added sugar , no corn syrup \( high fructose or otherwise \) , no preservatives , no artificial colors \( natural flavors and colors are added \) , and no gluten br br the orange tangerine flavor seemed to taste almost like carbonated sunny delight according to the label , the juice flavors are apple , grape , tangerine , orange and acerola it was quite tasty and had just the right amount of carbonation almost like a soda that has been opened and left to sit for just a few minutes to let some of the excess gas escape it was light and , dare i say , refreshing for what it is marketed to be , it does quite well br br the only downside is that i could probably do something similar at home buy some sunny d and add some sparkling water or seltzer , and it would probably be cheaper however , if you 're out and about and need something light , tasty and not loaded full of extra nonsense , then this would certainly fit the bill . 
taste is good enough to maybe purchase a 24 pack of this sugar free , 100 juice carbonated orange tangerine flavored drink with more folks \( like myself \) these days seeking out sugarless soft drinks , this switch product is actually quite good , i thought easy and small enough to carry might want to bring two ideal for a summer night outing at a theater in the park event , friend 's outdoor bar b que , kids softball game , etc . 
i'm diabetic , so i'm always looking for natural , flavorful drinks without a lot of added sugar switch fits the bill for me it 's lightly carbonated , much less than a regular soda the fruit flavor is very natural br br the orange tangerine tasted primarily like orange at first but then i noticed a distinct tangerine aftertaste the drink actually tasted very much like the tangelos i had the day before ! excellent ! br br the can is also smaller than a regular soda can that 's okay with me , it 's fine for a light drink when i'm thirsty a full can of soda is sometimes a bit too much br br switch will probably become one of my drink alternatives , and i'm looking forward to trying the other flavors . 
i like carbonated fruit juices and i think this one is fine it has a more tangy formula than the name suggests it 's more of a light fruit punch it 's refreshing and a good serving size , in my opinion it 's wonderful to have something that does n't contain high fructose corn syrup ! what 's here instead is 100 juice \( filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates , apple , grape , tangerine , orange and acerola juice concentrates \) , gum acacia , natural flavors and colors , ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) , contains soy delicious sweet light fruity tangy yum . 
i have n't seen this brand in cans before how exciting ! i know this brand can be hard to find at the store so it is nice to see it being sold here at amazon i am a big fan of 100 juice that has been lightly carbonated and have tried the few brands that are available and switch is one of my favorites my biggest beef with the brand is that it is just super hard to find , which has now been resolved i have to say that i do n't love the orange tangerine flavor , which is why i gave it four stars instead of five i just do n't really like orange flavored drinks but did like how this one had more tangerine flavor than straight up orange i would definintely recommend this brand ! . 
i drank this and could tell very little difference from a regular orange tangerine flavored soda , which is quite impressive considering that this drink is made from 100 juice ! it has 140 calories and a great alternative to a regular soda i will definitely be purchasing these in the future ! i also tried their kiwi strawberry carbonated juice and enjoyed it as well . 
dare i be corny and say , make a switch to the switch \? this soda has a great orange tangerine taste it is juice with carbonation , therefore , it can tout that it is all natural , without any added sugars it lacks that sickly sweet taste that soda with high fructose corn syrup tends to have , which is a bonus br br this can at 8 3 oz is following the `skinny can' trend , as well , which i think is great for packing in a cooler , your bag , or a picnic basket i would put these out at a party , as well , for mixed drinks , self service , and sake of ease . 
after the jp morgan corporate challenge road race in boston , they were handing these out at the finish line not only was i able to try the tangerine which i got from amazon i was also able to try a few of the flavors they were all really delicious they were n't heavy like a lot of sodas and you could taste the real fruit ingredients instead of the usual artificial flavorings the tangerine was especially good it was crisp , tart and refreshing and actually made for a nice recovery drink after the race to get some carbs back into the system my only complaint is that 8 3oz left me wanting more like a 12oz can very good . 
a good drink , about 3 ww points i mean it 's about what you 'd expect from an orange soda expect it 's all natural , so you recognize the things on the ingredient label br br downside really a lot of calories for such a small can ! . 
so far i 've only tried the orange tangerine flavor and it 's pretty good overall it does have a tangerine taste to it , though it 's accompanied by other flavors it 's clearly much more natural than regular soda or those 10 juice drinks since it 's just fruit juice concentrates and carbonated water vs the typical high fructose corn syrup plus artificial flavors , colors and preservatives in something like sunkist i think the juice blend is appropriate for this type of beverage it does contain more apple and grape than tangerine or orange , but those first two juices complement the carbonation well viz a viz sparkling cider i think straight carbonated orange tangerine juice would probably be a bit much the switch reminds me of appletiser , which is one of my favorites and has been around for many years , but is still pretty hard to find in the us br that having been said , i had to dock one star for a couple of reasons first , the cans just seem too small if they 're sticking with aluminum cans , i 'd like to see the standard 12oz size offered it seems like that would also have the advantage of making it easier to offer in regular beverage vending machines alternately , 16 or 20oz bottles would also work the second issue is the price while i understand there 's a huge difference between the cost of real juice and artificially flavored corn syrup , the current price still seems high , even in comparison to other juice drinks that might be partly because it 's from a relatively small company that does n't yet have the giant economies of scale that the likes of coke and pepsi can take advantage of , but it still seems like the price could come down a bit \( or at least serving size could increase without a price increase \) and it could perhaps still be made back up in increased sales volume br i pick up appletiser when i can find it , and i 'll likely do the same with the switch , at least from time to time . 
i really enjoyed this drink it tasted just like an orange soda , but i liked it more because it was 100 juice , and did n't have any extra additives br br the only negative is that since it is 100 juice \( and has no artificial sweeteners \) it is high in calories 140 calories to a can , to be exact br br however , if i were to choose between drinking this or drinking an apple or orange juice , i definitely would drink this as a treat plus , it would be really fun to pack in a cooler , especially for the young ones in your family br br please note , it is not just a single type of juice it is a blend of several juices , so it is not carbonated oj , it is something just a little different . 
i also reviewed the jones soda berry pomegranate vitamin water and that one fell short because it was mostly water and sugar and cost over 1 per bottle br br the switch orange tangerine is much better in my opinion in terms of flavor it 's also carbonated up quite a bit and has added ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) which gives it a lot of tang bite for me it is n't unpleasant at all i like it br br contrary to other reviews , i do n't get the medicine aftertaste it 's just a good , refreshing , carbonated drink i tried this after getting in from a fairly warm bike ride and it does a pretty good job of quenching thirst i tried it straight from a room temperature can and over ice and both were great i like it over ice better , though then , just for fun , i added some malibu rum to see how it was as a mixer and it 's not bad i wo n't be asking for it at a bar , but it gets the fruity flavor with the coconut rum and i think if someone was creative , this could be a match made in heaven br br the down side \( to me \) is this is another fairly pricey drink the cans are n't full size cans either so for almost 1 per can you get a smallish 8 3 ounces but with regular sodas you get 12 ounces half again as much of course , sodas are n't 100 juice either br br upshot is if i'm on a beach somewhere and hot and thirsty , i 'd probably buy this for stocking at home , i 'll stick with regular frozen orange juice or orange juice in a carton i would recommend trying it for yourself , though this seems to be one of those drinks that could sway pretty hard depending on personal preferences . 
like many others , i found the switch orange tangerine to be a little hard to classify it 's not too sweet , and not too tart , with a lot of flavor but it distinctly tastes blended creating a real flavor by playing with others br br it does n't really claim to be healthy , it just insinuates it in a number of ways on the other hand , it 's not too overly sweet like a typical soda and i found the carbonation was just about right br br bottom line it 's fairly tasty , but the small size for the price is a downside . 
i am very fond of citrus drinks to begin with , so maybe i am biased br br but what i liked most about this was it was n't too sweet and it is all natural and it has a real citrus taste not a fabricated one br br love it . 
i was pleased to discover that switch orange tangerine is actually quite tasty more please to find out that it contains no sugar , corn syrup or artificial flavors what it does have is several healthy ingredients i highly recommend it . 
very refreshing ! ingredients are 3 different fruit juices , sparkling water , and no sugar ! about 150 calories per can , and they 're smaller than regular soda cans so the ingredients are pretty natural , but 150 calories might be too much for some people ! . 
the first sip gave a pleasing flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation when testing the black cherry flavor , i had placed the can in the freezer for a short period , since i prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot i did n't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip as the drink warmed a bit , the sweetness overtook the carbonation , which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage , yet , due to the purity of the fruit base , the flavor remained true and welcome br br when trying the kiwi flavor , i just had the drink chilled perfectly for me , no ice crystals i like the kiwi even better than the cherry ! the kiwi has more tang see below \( or on the product description on the buying page \) for the juice blends used i 've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included , likely because those are cheaper to produce br br the way the drink was promoted was n't a lie ! it worked for me br br 1 100 of what you want 0 of what you do n't want br br 2 make the switch to a great tasting , all natural beverage that 's the perfect balance between juice and carbonation br br 3 the logo has the placed upside down and reversed , atop switch , with a swirl designed around the words , the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something br br 4 the ingredients read 100 juice \( filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates , apple , grape , kiwi , acerola i added the asterisk see below and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated \) , natural flavors , ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) br br 5 100 juice carbonated br br 6 the can is smaller than the norm for soda pops , which i also liked , because when i used to drink sodas regularly , i usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm \( and fizzed out \) , so the remainder went down the drain \( after i returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping i might drink it \) i drank the whole can of black cherry ! br br i decided i liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer leaving it too long , though , might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water and , of course , makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top br br in the past , when i had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages \( with phosphates , etc , added \) , i had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to club soda or ginger ale it did n't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble \( and it was more expensive than the cost of the switch product \) also , i like the types of fruits switch is using br br at first i was confused at the acerola ingredient , not knowing what it was since my a href http www amazon com gp product b00154jdai kindle 2 amazon 's new wireless reading device \( latest generation \) a was at hand , as always , i looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary the word was n't in there , so i pushed the curser to the right , on the arrow for more types of searches , and used my standby , google , and found several listings of acerola br br briefly , i found that it 's thought to have originated from the yucatan , and is known as barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle , a tropical fruit bearing shrub reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry , i was impressed ! it has 32 times the amount of vitamin c as orange juice , and many other healthful assets if you 're interested in details , feel free to go google br br i'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits \( i was glad to see that other flavors also have acerola in them \) br br though the can is appealing and fine , this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues do n't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues i have a book in progress to be published on kindle , which will debut with steam hissing out of kindle 's ears , at no extra charge ! \( i 'll add a comment to this review about why i had quit drinking soda pops , which will explain why i will be happily able to welcome switch into my diet \) br br my thanks to the switch for providing a healthy , gourmet quality drink without , thank god , soybeans added ! ! br br i'm hooked ! br br linda shelnutt br author of several kindle books and amazon shorts br br p s br with chagrin and apologies i 've had to add comment updates here . 
i realize that it is not quite healthy to guzzle 12 16 oz canisters of liquid at a sitting , but this switch orange tangerine flavored drink was so light and refreshing , and tasted so natural , that i could easily have downed another 8 3 oz can or two and that is the only reason this drink did not receive five stars i wanted more and the little can was just not enough ! it is the perfect size for a child , however so perhaps that who the drink is targeted for as an aside for those who prefer their beverages more adult oriented , this orange tangerine switch would make an awesome mixer with gin or vodka cheers ! . 
expecting something like fanta or sunkist i was surprised how smooth and subtle switch is definitely a good combination of refreshment and flavor love the fact that it does n't tast too carbonated . 
i tried the black cherry version and liked it but this one is much better great orange taste plus the benefit of juice and no corn syrup sweetner for those worried about its use the carbonation helps make it a satisfying drink to quench thirst and the knowledge that it is healthy satisfies the mind as well . 
the taste says fresh squeezed quality fruit the carbonation content is lower than some drinks of this variety this ratio makes for a heavier juice drink though a delicious treat , especially with breakfast on the deck , i prefer to save a few calories \( 140 per can \) and have more carbonation . 
as advertised this product puts only a small amount of carbonation in the drink the taste is similar to orangina but with a much more pronounced juice taste and mouth feel it actually leaves a thick taste in your mouth similar to when you drink orange juice from concentrate it is a bit high in sugar but at least it is natural fructose sugar from the fruits \( again , similar to real orange juice \) as there are no added sugars certainly not a calories conscience drink but not bad i do think the can is way too small but then again any more and the sugars and calories really soar . 
it 's basically carbonated fruit juice , but it 's heavier on the juice than a similar drink like rw knudsen 's \( the latter seems to never hit the spot \) this drink is a great balance of fresh fruit taste , the right amount of bubbles and something like zing very refreshing and tasty br br highly recommended . 
these 8 3 oz cans of switch keep their promise there are no added sugar , no corn syrup , and no preservatives it is a carbonated all natural 100 juice like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100 juice in this order filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates , \( apple , grape , tangerine , orange , and acerola juice concentrates \) , gum acaia , natural flavors and colors , ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) and soy i was very surprised that this taste like a great tangerine soda each can has 140 calories , 1orno thanks i am swimming from 15 mg of sodium , 34g of carbohydrates , 34g of sugar and 100 of rda of vitamin c and 20 of vitamin a br br i would be pleased to drink this sparkling orange tangerine flavored juice again i found it to taste good and be a refreshing drink but for my money i would rather by the a href http www amazon com gp product b0014x5o1c izze fortified sparkling juice , clementine , 8 4 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a brand of fortified sparkling juice that has a cleaner taste and fewer calories . 
i'm always on the lookout for soda 's that are made using real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice instead of chemicals switch 's ingredients are filtered water , apple , grape , tangerine , orange and acerola juice concentrates , gum acacia , natural flavors and colors and ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) it also says it contains soy so avoid it if you are allergic to soy one can contains 100 vitamin c and 20 vitamin a it also contains 34 grams of sugar and it tastes like it br br the taste of switch is very similar to regular orange soda which includes the syrupy taste that orange soda has i personally do n't like the syrupy taste and think this is way too sweet i can see kid 's liking the taste however and it is a much better alternative to regular orange soda 34 grams of sugar is a lot for 8 3 ounces of a drink i would avoid it for myself but may use it as an occasional substitute for my kids . 
this tangerine soda reminds me a lot of the drink called orangina but with a pronounced tangerine flavor br it is basically an all natural carbonated juice it is very refreshing and pleasant tasting over all i like it a lot . 
four people in my family tasted this orange tangerine drink it tasted good to all four people , and agreement from all four is difficult it does not taste like a soft drink , but much better if you are looking for a fiz that is tart , this is your drink . 
this orange tangerine juice bills itself as having 100 of what you want and 0 of what you do n't want it is pure orange and tangerine juice with a bit of carbonation , but no added sugar , preservatives and carbonation br br of course , that 's all great , but the big question is how it tastes i'm pleased to be able to say it tastes pretty good it has a bit less zip than i usually prefer in my orange soda , but a nice orange tangerine flavor and no noticeable aftertaste i would definitely try this again if i had the chance . 
this is a very tasty and refreshing little drink one of the best orange drinks you will find anywhere i only wish it were bigger , because it 's that good . 
now , we 're not big juice drinkers in this family we take apple juice or cherry juice and mix it with unflavored seltzer water because otherwise we find it too sweet this is the same it 's nicely carbonated , and it has a pretty authentic fruit taste , but it 's still too sickly sweet cut it half and half with unflavored seltzer and a little ice and you 'll be happy . 
i really enjoyed this drink the tangerine is very present and makes it very tasty this drink is 100 natural and has no sugar added the carbonation makes it a bit like a soda but a lighter and healthier one br br i enjoyed it and i would definitely recommend it to others as an excellent alternative to regular soda . 
pop the can and get sensory caress from the orange scent br the taste is pure citrus bliss great flavor i 'd say the flavor is halfway between fresh orange juice and really good orange soda the tangerine is definitely present , but mostly only as a very pleasent after taste br br love it . 
good things come in small packages ! ! this is an excellent non soda thirst quencher no sugar but an outstanding taste ! ! . 
the switch orange tangerine , 8 3 ounce can packs a big punch in a teeny tiny can touted as a healthy alternative to soda , i could n't help but taste the similarity between switch and coke 's fanta orange drink the difference however is more than plain switch is supposedly 100 carbonated fruit juice with no added sugars it actually has a pretty good taste if it is all natural , then i think kids would love it i liked the carbonation it had tons of bubbles and a light airy feel to it all in all , i would buy this product again br br natalie s for amazon vine . 
this product is a light and fruity carbonated beverage you might ask how that 's different from any other soda the difference is that this one leans more on the fruit side rather than the soda or sugar side i liked that about it while it was sweet it was n't syrupy sweet to the point that it was cloying and it did not have a strong after taste also it had a much more juicy aspect to it its kind of hard to describe but the best comparison i can make is it 's like one of those fruity v8 juices only carbonated maybe that 's not right either but i 'd recommend trying this at least once it just may be a taste you 'll find you 'll like again . 
the citrus flavor is crisp and clear in this carbonated juice it 's not too sweet , and the bonus of having no added hfcs or sugar is a winner the carbonation cuts the sweetness in a nice tart balance it is still high in calories , like any juice is , but i would definitely turn to this beverage over any of the manufactured sodas that contain added sugar , hfcs or preservatives . 
i was really surprised at the taste of the switch orange tangerine drink it reminds me of carbonated orange juice it is a little on the sweet side but not too bad in my opinion this is actually a beverage that i could drink all the time and not get tired of br br the best thing about switch is that it is healthy for you and it does n't have any added sugars and it has a lot of vitamin c switch is a all natural beverage which is great you can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda br br if you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then i highly recommend switch if you like orange juice then i think you 'll really enjoy this the cans are a little on the smaller side though . 
i really enjoyed this drink ! i am a lover of both orange juice and sunkist type drinks so i was very eager to try this drink it is the perfect combination of sweet and fruity ! ! ! the tangerine i believe helps give the extra lift of the sweet taste if you 're trying to cut back on pop , i highly recommend this drink or even just for a refreshing treat ! . 
i'm a big fan of avoiding corn syrup and a lot of the other ingredients that go into most processed foods and beverages these days , so this beverage idea really sounded good to me it does n't contain a bunch of artificial junk in it , and it still tastes pretty good i could definitely drink more of these they wo n't ever be my favorite beverage , but then i'm more of a non carbonated kind of drinker anyway this is definitely a good alternative to other products out there , and i 'd like to try other flavors as well . 
i highly recommend switch if you are looking for a soda that does n't have refined sugar and is loaded with flavor sweetened with fruit juice \( as opposed to high fructose corn syrup \) , this will definitely quench your thirst plus , all you tangerine lovers out there , this is the next best thing to eating the actual fruit ! . 
i really enjoy trying new things , so i found the idea of this soda pleasing it is essentially carbonated fruit juice , so it is naturally high in calories and thus comes in a small container that looks a lot like an energy drink i think this might confuse some , leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be however , i think a very valid complaint comes from some that feel this natural drink tastes a bit artificial this is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate , which always effects the flavor however , unlike the watermelon flavor , i found this variety vibrant and delicious the fruit flavor really comes through , including the often tricky tangerine it is an expensive treat , but would make a fun addition to breakfast in lieu of a similarly high calorie cup of orange juice . 
i was n't sure what to expect with this , but upon tasting it \( very chilled \) , i have to admit , it 's pretty darn tasty ! br br to give you an idea of what it tastes like take orange juice give it the familiar bite of your favorite carbonated beverage add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste , and there you go basically , it looks and smells like orange juice , but it tastes like orange pop should taste , if it really tasted like oranges my wife said it reminded her of minute maid orange pop \( or , as she would call it , orange soda \) br br our four year old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally , but we generally do n't let him after reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there 's no added sugar , corn syrup , preservatives , or artificial flavors , i can admit that i would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally \( but not too often , as it is quite a bit of sugar ! \) br br my wife made the observation that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages sadly , the sample we received was not enough to test this theory , but it should make a really , really good screwdriver . 
switch is a great alternative to sodas for our family ! love them and i do n't feel bad about the kids drinking them great variety of flavors ! i just wish they were more easily found in stores . 
we really have to limit additives and sugar for our son with autism switch orange tangerine really fills the bill he feels like he 's getting real fizzy soda , and mommy is happy it 's not loaded with chemicals and additives and actually has real juice in it a total win win . 
switch is a fantastic replacement for sodas you still enjoy having the carbonation but with fruit juice it is very satisfying . 
seriously a great orange drink on par with orangina without being super crazy sweet i have purchased this frequently since my first taste of it through the vine program also ! goes great with vodka or tequila ! . 
its nice to have a 'treat' to give my kids that they feel like they are getting soda they love the taste and i do n't feel like i'm having to compromise any quality br i do n't enjoy soda but i do enjoy this product and occasionally will grab a can great product at a good price ! . 
this is the only flavor of switch i have tried it tastes just fine and is not overly sweet the carbonation is nice more importantly though , this makes a fantastic mixer to use with vodka . 
firstly , i hate orange flavored sodas they all taste like ultra fake chemical laden floor cleaner to me switch is definitely not the case finally an orange soda that tastes like real oranges and tangerines who knew ! i thoroughly enjoyed this fizzy delight , which reminded me of a href http www amazon com gp product b001e3hlx6 san pellegrino aranciata sparking beverage 24 11 5 oz cans a but sweeter this , and all switch beverages are highly recommended . 
i really enjoyed this soda i used to be a big fan of orangina a few years ago but switch orange tangerine is way better especially if your looking for a true orangey taste a cold one of these would be very refreshing on a hot summer day tastes sort of like real orange juice mixed with seltzer , which begs the question why not just mix it yourself \? \( if your at home that is \) but i would n't hesitate buying one of these when out and about very tasty . 
i have tried a couple different flavors of this soda and found it to be pretty good its lighter than regular soda . 
all of the switch drink flavors taste good and go down refreshing , but this was the one that made me skeptical until i opened the can it does taste like fresh tangerines , and the flavor is bright and not weak or watery there 's just enough fizz to add some interest , but none of the bad stuff people like to avoid in a soda you know , artificial flavors and colors , preservatives and all that it 's just juice with fizz in fact , it 's good juice with fizz ! . 
this was pretty tasty , but orange has never been my favorite i recommend it if you like oranged flavored drinks i absolutely love the strawberry kiwi these drinks are not too sweet , natural and refreshing i will continue to try them my beverage of choice is water and milk \( and wine 0 \) \) but for an ocassional treat drinks like these are great br try them . 
one of my longtime favorite drinks is a half and half combination of club soda and fruit juice most fruit juices by themselves are a bit too sweet for me \( even the ones without added sugar \) , and the addition of carbonation just makes the whole thing more agreeable to me this drink does this for me , and amazingly , they do not add a boatload of sugar too many off the shelf beverages even those claiming to be healthful have way too much sugar \( or worse , the cheap corn syrup sugar substitute \) these guys give it none of that it 's both tasty and refreshing this is a product i would actually buy . 
i really liked this drink it 's 100 juice with no added sugar , so even though the sugar content is a little high , it has more nutrients than soda will have any day switch tastes like tangy , carbonated orange drink , and that 's fine with me ! i did n't notice any aftertaste , and i could feel safe drinking something fizzy \( and tasty , unlike sparkling water \) without feeling guilty about it but beware each can is only 8 3 ounces , a little more than a cup you decide if it 's worth it . 
i like this 'orange tangerine' more than the other two of these drinks i reviewed previously it tastes probably the least sweet of all three , but still a little too sweet carbonated for me it advertises 'no sugar added' and '100 juice carbonated' and 'no preservatives' , so i was expecting some sweet this drink tastes like carbonated , watered down orange juice , but it 's actually a pretty good flavor , and packs 140 calories , 34g sugar and 36g carbs in a 'no sugar added' 'no corn syrup' 'no preservatives' 'no artificial colors' 'gluten free' drink ! i would expect that from a juice like apple or cranberry , but i would also expect it to taste a bit more natural , and this one , like i said above , tastes like carbonated orange juice with tangerine it 's nice tasting , but too much in the way of calories such for me to drink this very often br br it was certainly good , but for the tastebuds of someone who was a lifelong soda drinker \( diet soda for the past 12 years \) , and gave up soda a year ago \( i very occasionally drink a carbonated beverage now \) this is not the drink for me i mostly drink water , milk , iced tea , hot tea coffee now , and this sweet tasting , sugary tasting beverage , had way too much carbonation flavoring for me ! the orange tangerine flavors were nice but still tasted fake , which is weird for a drink that touts things like '100 juice' and a label that says 'natural flavors' i would recommend this product only to those who like somewhat sweet , fruitie carbonated beverages enjoy ! . 
it seems that soda was n't as good as when i was a kid , and people have pointed out that it might be the high fructose corn syrup that is making the taste more dull well , this orange soda is made with real sugar , as well as a few extra healthy things , and the taste is much , much better than the regular orange sodas you might find otherwise br br the price is about in line with what you 'll find in a soda can and the taste is great why would you drink the hfcs mentioned earlier that is just horrible for your body when you have this option \? i highly recommend it , i thought it was quite fabulous . 
i usually drink my soda room temperature but with this one i really needed it to be cold the taste is okay but takes a bit getting used to the tangerine in orange soda there was not as much carbonation which is fantastic as far as i'm concered and it was n't exceedingly sweet i would most certainly consider getting this again as i do n't think it 's all that bad it 's nice to have a bit of change from the usual orange soda flavor . 
i tried switch orange tangerine drink excellent flavor and not so sweet as to make you feel you are getting a ton of sugar it has no added sugar and no corn sweetners , so , it is more natural than any other orange soda type drink more like a sparkling juice drink i have been a fan of orange juice and soda type drinks when as a kid i would mix oj and orange soda yet the natural taste of this drink is refreshing i tried it both with and without ice and although the iced version is more refreshing , if you get a very cold can of this drink it tasted very satisfying and did not leave you with an after taste or with the sugar blues br br caution , it has 34 grams of sugar , and although natural , you should check with a doc if you have sugar problems 34 grams is equivalent to 5 or more teaspoons of sugar at least , if you like sparkling fruit drinks , check this one out i will next try it with added sparkling water to it enjoy . 
switch has been the first soda alternative that i 've loved ! it 's got a delightful fresh fruit flavor , refreshing bubbles , and no aftertaste it is sweet and juicy tasting , reminds me a little of orange crush the tangerine flavor adds just the right note to peak your interest and overcome becoming just another orange drink however , the price point of just at 1 a can prevents me from keeping it stocked in our home still , i would recommend it for an occasional treat . 
the switch orange tangerine is a nice beverage that is lightly carbonated and is made with real fruit juice unlike most sodas , the switch products are made with real ingredients \( none of the high fructose corn syrup \) and it tastes great the cans come in a convenient 8 5 ounce can and they 're great for lunch or an mid afternoon treat , if you want a light beverage that 's made with the good stuff then you 'll want to grab a can of the switch do yourself a favor throw out the hfcs sodas and make the switch . 
the switch in orange tangerine has perfect serving size to keep the sugar in take at its minimum and naturally the carbonated sensation adding extra awakening sparks to the taste buds ! br br that was my wife 's first impression br br i like the fruit soda idea it maybe a better alternative soda if it is indeed made of natural orange , but it taste likes other carbonated orange flavored soda on the market the only benefit you are getting and not from the regular soda is it contains daily recommended 100 vitamin c if the price is right , does n't hurt to try . 
i 've now tried several of the switch drinks they 're not bad , for a carbonated juice drink , especially this , actually , was one of the better flavors i 've tried it 's got a nice orange juice type flavor that i enjoyed ultimately , these drinks remind me of apple beer , which is essentially carbonated apple juice i love that drink , and think switch could try an apple version of their product i'm sure i 'd love it as well br br that being said , give it a try it will quench your thirst , and i'm sure it 'll do well in the marketplace it fills a void where very few drink manufacturers have entered . 
i do n't know if it has changed since then , but when i lived in australia 14 years ago , one thing that stood out to me was how real drinks tasted compared to the artificial flavors typical of america switch brought me back to those days it starts out tangy and the taste turns sweeter in my mouth if they knocked 50 calories off , i would definitely purchase this regularly . 
i always liked orange crush when i was a kid sure , it was just sugar water with some flavoring , but it was really good flavoring except it had a chemical whang and an aftertaste that you just had to accept br br well , no more switch orange tangerine drink is not sugar water it 's 100 juice , the good stuff , and it 's lightly carbonated , not overcarbonated like those sugary soft drinks either and no chemical whang ! and no aftertaste ! br br vitamin c and no added sugar \? i 'll take that of course there 's sugar content , but it 's just the natural sugar that comes in the juice why did n't people think of this stuff when i was a kid \? . 
switch is a 100 natural carbonated fruit juice beverage i like the way it tastes it 's very sweet and a little tangy the ingredients are as follows 100 juice from apple , grape , tangerine , orange and acerola , gum acacia , natural flavors and colors , ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) , soy br br an 8 3 oz can has 140 calories , 36 grams of carbs , 100 daily requirement of vitamin c and not much else . 
the mixture of juices they use to sweeten this give it a little bit of an odd taste and makes it too sweet it 's not a straight orange citrus flavor not being an apple juice fan i was n't fond of it br br i gave it four stars b c it is what it advertises it 's juice with sparkling water , unlike some other healthy sparkling beverages that are basically soda br br for sparkling juice i prefer izze it 's a little less sweet . 
this is a nice , refreshing carbonated drink it has no added sugar , as advertised but its name is a bit misleading the orange tangerine also has some apple and grape juice added the grape is not a great addition to the blend , so i was n't thrilled with the flavor . 
the switch tries to blur the line between soda and juice , and i 'd say that the experiment is successful it 's sweet and rich like soda , but it is , as the label says , 100 juice , and therefore of vastly more nutritional value i guess it all comes down to taste , and it 's more similar to soda than juice here , maybe like a more toned down sunkist soda as i said , i liked it , and i 'd probably pick it up again , though it has n't displaced squirt as my favorite . 
i have tasted several of the other flavors of this drink , switch , but i have to say that this one tops them all perhaps it is because i like orange soda , and this drink seems to have all the elements of what i like in the soda without all the harmful ones there is no sugar added , no preservatives , no artificial colors and it is gluten free this is especially great for someone with allergies , or those who are on restricted diets add to that that it is 100 juice and tastes great and you have a winner i liked this product and plan to seek it out at my local store . 
hands down my all time favorite iced tea i typically prefer loose tea , but the taste of this tea is wonderful ! the pouches are so easy to use and make clean up a breeze . 
this tea is to die for it hits the spot easy to make ice tea all of my friends love it as well i am delighted to serve it i look forward to drinking it , it is my new favorite drink ! . 
we go through a lot of dressing and my husband has to have this brand only , so i saw this and said great ! . 
the cups to make my own coffee k cups work fine if there had been free shipping it would have been better , but i will order again and look for a way to not pay 1 2 the price of the product just for shipping . 
much better than having to fight removing coffee grinds from a metal basket i love being able to just toss grinds into the trash . 
i'm very pleased with the disposakups they were part of a christmas gift for my husband and he is busily filling the disposakups with his favorite starbucks coffee needless to say , these will part of the keurig experience for him and we plan to purchase more once he 's used the two boxes i ordered i was especially pleased that the order arrived in time for christmas since i was late in finding them we will definitely use this company again ! . 
these wonderful cups , filters , lids saved me from returning my new single cup coffee maker tried many k cup brands and blends and did n't care for any of them nor did i like my own coffee option that came with the coffee maker the disposa kups are just what i needed to get a good cup of my own coffee from my new coffee maker would recommend and will order again received in 3 days during christmas rush ! . 
these little cups are a perfect compliment to our k cup varieties ! we use them for our coffees and loose teas i was not disappointed and they are much easier to use than the reuseable cups sold by keurig . 
i am giving this as a gift to go along with a single coffee brewer though ratings say there are problems , saving money on easy to purchase coffee is better we live in the sticks in wisconsin . 
this was a great buy for the money and a hard product to find i was pleased when i received it doing it this way i cut my coffee costs down by 2 3rd even after you consider the price of the product i am very happy . 
the cup filter lid combination that allows for use of ones own coffee in the kuerig brewer is a great idea the quality of the product is good , and the use is simple now if they could just get the price down ! unfortunately , we use and love 8 o'clock bean coffee which is among the cheapest because we buy it in bulk and grind our own beans if we could save costs by buying disposakups in quantities of 250 or so , that would be great ! . 
these were on backorder for a long time but well worth the wait i can finally use the coffee beans i 've had for awhile and have a great cup of coffee with no grounds i totally love the product and will definately order more in the future would like to see them in 100 count . 
these coffee holders are much easier to use than the others i have used and make life a little easier ! . 
nice product good company only complaint is that it took over a month for them to ship it after i ordered and they never let me know what was going on . 
i just received my order , and happy with the ability of using some gifted coffees , i never used before , as i like my one cup at a time only problem i have found is that the caps are sometimes difficult to get set properly i made up several cups with different coffees and store them with the rest of my supply i 'll be back for more , and will tell my keurig friends . 
i have been using the disposakups for about 2 weeks they are easy to put together and fill caps fit snug i sometimes get overfill , but my cuisinart does that with regular k cups i put regular coffee in it , maxwell house , community coffee , sometimes i grind my own coffee always taste just like in drip coffee maker great replacement for k cups cause they have literally doubled in price in just 6 months . 
these worked great for us we are able to reuse the plastic parts a couple of times before discarding them we love being able to use our favorite coffee . 
the disposakups are so easy and convenient to use they are a great substitute when i run out of k cups and do n't want to run to the store to buy a replacement supply and pay higher in store prices . 
shipped in great shape i gave these to my son , he is the one who uses reg coffee and he really likes these disposable k cups i guess i will still have to send him coffee beans every mo . 
i love coffee that i buy locally and this product allows me to use it in my keurig brewer getting the lid on is a little challenging , but the end result is worth it this is the coolest find of mine this year ! ! . 
i purchased the cups , lids and filters they work exactly how i expected them to work perfectly ! the lids and cups can be used more than once the filters unfortunately cannot i am going to be looking in the future for cups that have the filters attached like in the regular prefilled k kups very good product though ! . 
i was very pleased with these disposable k cups i read other peoples comments that the lids are hard to get on i found that true at first until i just used one finger and pressed them on in the center i heard a click and they were ready to go i will order a larger amount next time to save on shipping the hot chocolate k cups prefilled are terrible , but these filled with your own chocolate mix are very good . 
great product brought it for a gift and will be buying some more for me user friendly product , easy to use and works with any kcup machine . 
these fill your own k cups are great to have and use with a custom coffee that does n't come in the k cup variety they are disposable and you can fill several and have them ready i also drink a herbal tea that i buy in bulk and now i can make it with my kuerig would definitely buy again to have on hand . 
i recently went to hawaii and bought tons of coffee it was such a pain to use the my k cup attachment on the keurig machine because i 'd have to dump it out and wash it after every use disposakups are a great alternative and work wonderfully with my machine ! it 's now super easy for me to use my own coffee ! the only drawbacks i have found is that you really have to fill the filter all the way up to get good flavor it leaks a little bit so the outside of the cup is a bit wet after using lastly , water moves through it a bit slower than normal k cups so brewing a cup takes a bit longer than normal i would still highly recommend this to anyone who wants to use their own coffee with their keurig machine ! . 
i love the cups i have reviewed this before and said the same thing saving a lot of money using these kups . 
this product is exactly as described i use my keurig brewer daily and now i am able to use my choice of coffee they are simple to use and work great the delivery from liquibuy , llc on amazon was prompt and packaged perfectly . 
this is the second time i 've ordered this product and i plan to order these often they work perfectly and i am able to use my favorite speciality coffees especially when i run out of the prefilled k cups sold at retail stores . 
this product worked exactly as advertised i filled several cups in advance with my own coffee and was able to use them in my machine just like a k cup prior to purchasing , i read a review stating that the lid came off when the user was attempting to remove it from the machine this was not the case for me the lid was secure and it functioned just like the more expensive prefilled k cup i will order these disposakups regularly . 
these cups are so easy to use and saves so much money compared to the store bought kups you can use whatever coffee you want and have as many flavors as you want we are on our 9th box of these and will continue to use them br br the seller is great in regards to contact and shipping the last shipment arrived just a couple of days after we bought them long before the due date listed when the order was placed . 
i was so happy to see that someone realized that the kcup is a product in a lot of homes these disposable kcups make using ground coffee a simple clean and easy way to enjoy a favorite coffee , tea or hot chocolate beverage easy i work as a merchandiser and am always searching to find the new products and making sure that i can reccomend the products to the customers and stores that i service . 
these disposakups are the cats meow they serve the purpose thy were intended for very well and were delivered as promised on time and well packaged arrived in good condition i would recommend to all friends . 
i have the regular my k cup accessory that comes with the keurig , but you have to insert the special holder and fill the filter each time , then wash them both out i like these because they are disposable and i can fill several at one time and have them ready in the refrigerator when i want them very convenient . 
these cups work great ! we have had a keurig for about a year and use a refillable filter cup its so tedious to refill every time you want a cup of coffee especially at 4am before work ! these cups are so easy to use and perfect for mornings when you just want a quick cup of coffee the lids are a little tough to get on sometimes and they get stuck in the top of the machines occasionally , but still much less work than the filter cup we were using before we get a basketful ready at the beginning of the week and they are ready to go each morning it 's great ! so much more affordable than the name brand cups great product , great value ! . 
for those reviews that say the coffee was n't strong enough or the cup leaked , they simply do n't know what they 're doing first of all , use the right kind of coffee the first time i used it , i put in a medium roast that was n't ground very fine and yes , the coffee was weak so i switched to a very finely ground dark roast and it was perfect and yes , they will leak and leave grounds in your keurig if you do n't let some of the filter hang over the edge and seal it correctly i had no problem with sealing the cup so far so good makes as good a cup of coffee as the more expensive ready made k cups and have yet to find any grounds in my coffee or in the keurig really a good deal , plus i had them three days after ordering very quick shipping . 
what a pleasure it is to be able to use my own coffee , even make cups up to take to work with me ! these are easy , mess free alternatives to the apparatus i bought to use with my machine , there are no coffee grounds in my sink now ! . 
i received and have been using my disposakups for several days i highly recomend this product i fill up a dozen or so at a time and just pop them into the coffee maker when i want a fresh cup of coffee the coffee comes out fresh and with no coffee grounds in the cup who could ask for more \? . 
they are just the right size , the filter works fine and so does the lid br they 're easy to fill and store for future use br since its all in one and disposable like the pre filled keurig cups , its a good way to enjoy my favorite brand of coffee . 
got product on time early in fact , great experience ! i would order from them again ! very good place to buy these from . 
easy to use and saves money gives you control on the strength of your coffee i will purchase them again . 
love the product ! i can now custom blend my personal favorite coffee blends , and get them cheaper than buying pre fab k cups ! . 
this product works exactly as it is advertised no more rinsing wire baskets the coffe is as good as the already filled k cups that you buy in the store it 's nice to just throw the whole thing in the trash when done and not clog the sink could n't be happier as it gives me unlimited choices for coffee and it saves money too ! amazon is great ! . 
the seller was prompt to ship , i receive the disposable k cup in two days when i receive them , i try one of the disposable k cup on keig , the ease of use and the quality of the cup it made and the saving from pre fill k cup coffee brands is worth the price . 
i love these disposable k cups as i prefer to use my own brand \( s \) these accomplish the job perfectly and so easy to use thankyou for this product seller was prompt in shipping good packaging i will purchase again a . 
i am a creature of habit , and when i purchased my keurig , i tasted alot of the coffee brands and flavors made for my appliance however , i never found one that i said this could replace the coffee i am currently using so when i discovered the disposable k cups i was delighted the problem now was i did not purchase enough so now i am waiting on my second delivery great service . 
over a year ago i purchased a breville k cups brewer and immediately found the the available selection and choices to exceed what i had expected i loved using it and brewing what i wanted , 1 cup at a time i found that i was paying about 40cents cup and that was also great br now the prices have soared to nearly or over 1 cup and that has made me slow down my purchase rate and my enjoyment of my single cup brewer br br enter the disposakups and suddenly the price is reasonable again and i can grind my own or purchase ekobrew and use their coffees these are so simple , convenient and easy that i really enjoy that my world of coffee is wide open again br br thanks for such a great product ! br br ted . 
i ordered the disposakups because i have several coffees in bags that i had left over and wanted to use the cups work great i quickly figured out that the filter must be pushed down in order for the lid to fit easy to load and easy to dispose . 
these work just fine after spooning ground coffee into a series of these cups \( do it over a plate with ground coffee in a small bowl \) doing so , you get just the fine coffee you want and are not trapped by the standard selections but there 's no saving money 14 lb coffee works out to 25 cents per cup plus the 25 cents per disposakup gives 50 cents per cup , about the price of regular k cups darn ! hoped i 'd save money but i do get my choice . 
i have tried another brand of one cup coffee making these made the job easy and no mess the other method had a plastic holder and lid and a paper basket you disposed of the inserted paper basket only the plastic would be very warm to the touch at the very least then you had to rinse the plastic holder and top for any grinds that might have escaped . 
this product saves me money since i can use a regular brand that i like in these kcups and i can still have the kcup convenience of making one drink at a time without using nasty instant coffee great product ! . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b004k30ho2 disposakups disposable k cups for keurig brewers 50 cups , lids , filters 100 disposable a br br i bought these because i occasionally run out of my favorite blend and like the convienience of these over the permanet type filters i also prefer decaf black unsweetened tea for iced tea that is unavailable in k cups these are great for both and i am reordering to keep onhand could n't be happier ! . 
fast service and shipping these little k cups are great as you can use any kind of coffee or tea that you like , at a much reduced price over regular k cups easy to use no mess , what 's not to like if you have coffee maker that uses k cups you have to try these , it puts you back in control of drinking the kind of coffee you like . 
i really enjoy this disposable the only thing that would make it better would be for the cups and lids to be made out of a more eco friendly material coffee tastes great . 
when i used the k cup filter that came w keurig , i did n't like the taste of any coffee i used so i stopped using it altogether however , when i saw disposakups on amazon , i had my doubts but took a chance they worked great plan to keep them in stock . 
i am so grateful that disposkups exist and are now in use in my home ! br br no other type of device for brewing bagged coffee in my keurig \( k cup \) or any other way to recycle k cups has worked well for me the standard device made by keurig is so difficult to clean each time , that i just choose to never use it br br disposakups are the perfect item for brewing my favorite coffees that are not available in k cup form the pieces fit together perfectly , and with a snap i'm able to brew a cup of coffee and still have the disposable feature of regular k cups \( and no clean up ! \) plus , you can assemble however many custom k cups ahead of time with disposakups , so they are very helpful to have for holiday gatherings and parties br br thank you thank you ! i will be purchasing a big supply soon , so i will be well stocked for the holidays ! . 
i love these disposakups they allow me to use some of my favorite canned or fresh bean coffee in my keurig coffee maker there is no mess , easy as using the regular k kups , just throw away when you are done making your coffee love the convenience i have just place a 2nd order . 
the disposakups work as advertised they are easy to use , just put your favorite coffee in the cup , pop the cap on and brew this allows me to save quite a bit of money while using my favorite coffee i filled about 25 of them at one time so there is always one standing by when i am desperate for a cup there is no need to wash out a filter , just toss it in the trash like the store bought k cups they also make a good backup system if you run out of the store bought k kups br i would be interested to know if the company uses , or plans to use , recycled plastic or plastic alternatives in the manufacturing of these . 
great product to tide me over with my supply of starbucks til they start making k cups easy to assembl and use with my own ground coffee . 
great product , enables you to use your own coffee in your single brew maker and i can make up several at a time ! ! ! . 
this product works just as described ! you simply place a filter in the disposable cup , add your own coffee , snap on the lid , and make the cup of coffee as you would with a regular k cup the coffee is just as good as any prepackaged k cups , and you can use the brand of your choice at a fraction of the cost \( and no washing out those pesky mesh reusable filters ! \) as some other reviewers have noted , sometimes the cup gets stuck on the handle that raises as you are trying to remove the used cup but you simply pull it out and i 've never had a lid fall of , so there is still no mess i will definitely continue to use this product ! . 
i was getting tired from washing out the little refillable baskets to make a second cup the solutions are to get multiple baskets or the disposable type the filtering is a little better and the coffee has fewer solids it is easy to use and does what it says . 
tried the disposable k cups and they work great , just as good as keurig k cups put my own mid grind coffee in cups and they worked without problems they could n't be any easier to use will continue to use them . 
like the disposakup lids , the disposakup set is just as good if not better if you tossed your previous keurig kcups , this set will take care of you i will definitely be purchasing them again . 
i love disposakups and i'm so glad that liquibuy provides them to consumers br disposakups are fantastic and the vendor does a very good job communicating with its customers . 
i have lots of ground coffee and since having my keurig have not been able to use it but , with the disposable cups , i can use up all my ground coffee and get the tastes i want i would buy again convenient \( be sure you snap the lid on securely because it is a tight fit \) . 
my wife just loves these cups first off i have to say they arrived a month earlier than stated excellent ! the convenience of being able to use your own coffee and throw away the little cups afterwards is fantastic no clean up excellent . 
i have ordered three boxes of these so far they work very well shipping was fast their claim to fame is the ability to pre fill these little cups and store them for later i just store them in the freezer the problem with most refillable disposable filter k cups , is that they are prepared on a per cup basis to me this defeats the whole usefulness of the k cup system instead with these , i can sit at the table , and quickly throw together all 50 and store them convienience is maintained and the cost effectiveness goes up as these are so much cheaper than buying the prepared ones . 
i found these cups to be easy to use , and a lovely way to make pods of your own favorite coffee . 
thank god they finially made them i ca n't always afford the buy the regular k cups the only change i would make is to have peel and stick top for them the peel and sticks could have your own name on them so you could share them with your friends ron . 
we have the k cup , however , these disposable k cups are the best ever i am always rushed in the morning and cleaning out the old k cup to make another cup of coffee to put in the togo cup , is not what i want to do br br i'm so grateful to have found this product ! ! ! . 
this is a great product and would highly recommend to all keurig fans you can make your own k cups at a fraction of the cost . 
this filters are perfect to use with the extra ground coffee i have they are as good or better than the k cups . 
i really liked the premise of the product so i ordered they are not easy to store and therefore assemble for use but this overcomes the usefulness of the product . 
product arrived earlier than expected and was just what i expected an easy and cheap way to make my own keurig k cups great for company everyone gets what they want without having to buy a whole box of k cups i just buy a few of the little one pot coffee packages and can make whatever someone wants awesome ! . 
i love this product ! ive tried several different options , this one is the best unlike most people , k cups are too strong for me with this i can make it however i want , and my husband can use the k cups most products ive tried just dont filter good enough , but this one does i like being able to just throw it away when im done its a little pricey , mostly shipping costs , but all in all , worth it . 
not at all happy with the instant coffee taste of my cute little brewer , i began hunting for a solution the disposakups were it ! ! my own fresh ground coffee packed in tight in the disposakup makes a good cuppa joe easy to use and no mess love them shipping was fast and they are a good value in my opinion thanks . 
disposakups disposable k cups for keurig brewers 50 cups , lids , filters 100 disposable are handy because you buy your own coffee that you like and just fill k cups and then throw them out i pre fill them so all i have to do is put them in the machine . 
these things work very well the only trouble i 've had with them is if you leave one in the machine overnight , it sticks and is hard to get out otherwise , a great product ! ! ! . 
finally , a cheaper alternative to buying k cups , i can use all of the half full bags of coffee in my cupboard from my pre keurig days ! works perfectly for both of my keurig machines ! . 
there is known design flaw having to do with the gasket on the upper needle you can hear the screams about that by reading the reviews for the 'my cup' the gasket moves too much and as a result is does not seal correctly green mountain seems to not want to fix it since it means selling less over priced coffee , which is what these machines are designed to do br br 1 no matter what method i use , i have learned to carefully reach in and pull the little washer gasket down as far as i can on the upper needle this will ensure a better seal and avoid overflow br br 2 just as importantly when i put the disposakup in , i press it down to make sure the lower needle has pierced the cup completely this will make sure you have a flow of water that streams through the cup br br 3 fill it up and then tap the cup on the counter to settle the coffee grinds into the cup , do not press the coffee down or pack it in br br the key is take a couple extra seconds and these will work perfectly and you will save money i love mine and will be ordering more once they are available again . 
after a lot of trial and error \( with just water ! \) i figured out how to make these handy self fill coffee pods not leak all over the place the secret is to shove the filter all the way into the pod and not snap the lid over the edge of the filter make sure the filter is all inside it 's rigid enough and stays upright and fine when you brew you really need to create a seal with the lid leaving the filter hanging out breaks the seal and allows liquid to seep out . 
my daughter lives in hawaii and sent me some great coffee from there i have a keurig and was not sure how to use the new coffee i got these fast fast and now am using my hawaiian coffee great product . 
this comment refers to all of the do it yourself k cups br my k cup by keurig br ekobrew br ez cup br br they products above all have the same problem br you have to get the correct grind on the whole coffee bean br and it 's not what you think if you are familiar with grinding espresso br br if water is coming out the top , \( of the products listed above \) the grind is too small and or too much volume br the coffee is too weak and you jump to the conclusion it 's because the grind is too coarse or you do not have enough coffee br wrong , it 's because the water went over the top and not thru the grounds is the reason it is weak br start off with about 1 3 4 tablespoons \( do not exceed 2 tablespoons \) br the grind will probably be more coarse than what you typically use for bunn type drip br br once i got the right combination of grind setting and amount of coffee , all of these filters worked br br i have the capresso infinity conical burr grinder br for duncan donut whole bean i use the br medium 4 position br i use two tablespoons br br there are 16 grind settings br extra fine 1 4 br fine 1 4 br meduim 1 4 br coarse 1 4 br br note that for bunn drip coffee i use medium 2 br br for espresso i used from fine 3 to other settings \( adapted to get a 25 second draw \) br br once you get the right recipe they all work br br but br where this product comes in handy is not in brewing coffee , but in storing your recipe in an air tight container br br grind a weeks worth of coffee and store it in these cups with the lid on and no holes in the bottom br br then during the week , grab one of these already premeasured cups , br remove the lid br and pour into the my keuring k cup br br i found that if the grind is toward the fine side , all these will leak the my k cup was the best of the lot for not leaking , br but like i said above if the get the grind more toward the coarse side they all will work br br bottom line br this product is great for storing pre measured amounts that you have ground earlier in weekly batches br make your measuring and grinding mess once and then fill up 14 or so of these cups with your own recipe br br if you want to get more accurate , instead of using tablespoons get a good digital scale for weighing br br note that if you are in a hurry then go ahead and do use this product as advertised here br i just thought that these were too expensive also and that you had to keep reordering them br but yes go ahead and use them if you want to do that . 
these do work nicely , but some of them for some reason seem to stick on the upper needle i have yet to figure out why they stick on that needle , but when they do it is a real pain to remove it ! this is a minor , and only a sometimes glitch , so that is why 4 stars in stead of 5 br my machine in a brand new one , so the needle being dirty is n't the problem when these do n't stick , they work very nicely and as stated br i wish the little cups that hold the filters were biodegradable as that would be a real plus , but these do save money since the k cups are so expensive i will continue to use these , and spend the savings on really great coffee ! ! lol ! . 
i have never enjoyed my keureg more ! they could n't be easier to use and i'm so happy to be using my favorite coffee and making it to my own specifications love these things ! ! br br additional comment in reading the reviews i see some complaints about leakage , etc one trick i have come to rely on is not to fill the kup all the way to the top with the coffee you need to leave some room at t the top so that the lid is n't touching the coffee inside \( maybe a little less than 1 2cm from the top rim \) when i follow this protocol , i get a perfect cup every time when i fill it too high , i end up with leakage the only problem is that i usually need a cup of coffee int he morning before i can follow my own instructions . 
i ordered 100 disposakups they came fast and were just what was advertised i will definitely be re ordering thanks alot ! ! . 
empty k cups , miniature filters and lids allow you to use your own favorite ground coffee if you buy roasted beans and grind your own , this is the solution for you one scoop in the k cup , put on the lid and pop it into your kuerig br br i shied away from buying a kuerig because i love my kenya aa from talk 'n coffee in deptford , nj they roast it dark , grind it almost to percolator coarseness for me \( sigh \) and ship it to me here in florida i had tried mesh filters but even with my custom percolator grind , i 'd get grinds in the brew the special cup holders looked like a labor intensive solution too so i stuck with my mr coffee when i saw the disposable cups on amazon , i ordered them along with the keurig br br this works great ! a single fresh hot cup of kenyaa aa dark roast whenever the spirit moves me and no worries about having to make a partial pot for only one cup i 'll have talk 'n coffee grind the beans a little finer for the kuerig on my next order i re ground my percolator grind a little finer and the portion strength is now perfect for the travel mug size br br kathy buys loose tea and uses the disposable k cup for a mug whenever it suits her fancy it 's a lot easier than the little metal thingie with the chain and waiting for a kettle to boil br br one benefit i had n't counted on is that clean up is easy and fast pluck the used disposable k cup from the kuerig and toss it in the trash no more having to service the coffee pot ! br br to save time in the morning , i used to set up mr coffee the night before but now i just make up the disposable k cups a dozen at a time and we fresh brew by the cup in the morning for several days running we actually use less coffee after evaporation and who does n't want the last cup considerations i think the savings on coffee and mr coffee filters is probably break even with the cost of the disposable k cups so net net , they seem free br br only one con from me it 's hard for these arthritic old hands to fit the lid on due to the filter overlapping the top of the k cup folding or cutting away the overlap causes grinds in the brew and a clogged lower needle i do n't think there is a cure without the downside being greater than the problem i have found patience and not over loading the k cup to be the best solution . 
great product i was looking for a way to use my coffee in my krueig machine \( by cuisinart \) with out having to use the supplied filter let 's face it , the whole point is to make a cup of coffee using the k cup and not have to fill the little filter , then clean it afterwards kinda defeats the purpose i was looking for this type of item and hoping that i could pre package my brand of coffee i was skeptical at first , but thought for the price , i 'd give it a try and the product works great i fill up the 50 cups with the filter , lid and store it in an old k cup box the lids fit tight and it works just like the more expensive k cups the only issue is that on my 12 cup setting , there is a little spill over , but there are no problems with the 10 cup setting once in a while when you open the top to put in another cup , it will stick to the top of the machine where the hole punctures the cup , but that 's in once in a while in fact i am about to purchase again i only wish the shipping was n't as much as the product it arrived earlier than scheduled i believe all in all , i will be using these on a regular basis . 
when i bought my keurig brewer , i was so impressed at how it worked the different types of coffee and how it brewed br however i did not realize how expensive the coffee k cups would be i could n't spend 80 00 dollars a month on coffee ! ! br br then i found disposakups what a great idea and they are so easy to use the very best part about them is that fact that they can be thrown away no having to wash the insert that keurig provides br br these cups do not leak they work perfectly ! i will be ordering more . 
it worked just as it claimed i had no leaking at all and it brewed a really great tasting cup of coffee really happy that i 've found these . 
these cups and filters work excellent a cheaper alternative to use your own coffee br will definitely purchase more . 
i looked , i bought , i tried several different types of brewing cups for the cost and quality , these are the best ! i can make a few ahead of time using my preferred brand of coffee i 'll , definitely , keep these in stock at my house ! . 
i recently received a kuerig coffee maker and realized that the coffee cups would be a costly add on to the product disposacups came to the resue these durable cups can be filled with your own coffee rather than the expensive kuerig cups my only issue with these cups is that when i fill them to save for later use , the tops do not stay on snuggly hope they work on this . 
the pods worked as described i did not have overflows i found the best way to secure the top is to press the raised area in the center of the top wish they were sold in larger quantities . 
i had been looking for something to use with my own coffee i know the keurig has its own my k cup but i was n't satisfied with the results there were also suggestions on making personal k cups by saving the used k cups and rinsing them out and refilling them with coffee and then covering them with foil or plastic wrap what a pain that was br br after looking at several different disposable k cups for the keurig i came across this one and felt it did what i wanted much less mess involved and works great . 
these disposakups work great i simply fill up a dozen or more with my favorite flavored coffee , and i'm good to go it 's a great alternative to buying the expensive pre filled k cups not only were the pre filled k cups expensive , but they do n't offer my favorite coffee blends i was using the reusable k cup filters which are quite expensive to purchase , so i only had 2 they leaked while brewing were messy to empty and wash to re use the disposakups work much better just as well as the pre filled k cups , no leaks , no mess ! and i can re use them again if i want by throwing out the filter , rinsing , using a fresh filter \( just have to line up the holes \) great product ! i highly recommend it i love my coffee machine again . 
awesome idea ! i could n't find my husband 's favorite coffee in the k cups , so i bought these to make my own works great with loose leaf teas too . 
this product is the way to go for making your own favorite blend of coffee and loose leaf tea i use them for tea and found that i can reuse them for two or three cups . 
i purchased this product to be able to use my own coffee and tea in the keurig the product does what it says the only drawback that i can tell exists is the expensive shipping i 'd also like to have some suggested measurements for coffee and tea to fill the cup perhaps a section on their website where people can just start recording their experiences with different amounts of product just my 2 cents . 
i really like the idea of the k cup coffee maker you make it the strength that you want and no wasting a half a pot of coffee i did not like the horrible price for the pre made k cups this is a great compromise the only thing that could be a bit of a problem for some is that they will leak if you do n't puncture them fully this is easily corrected by lifting the open close lever once and closing a second time now , if they would make them out of biodegradable cardboard or something else i could compost , the rest of the planet would love them too . 
these work fine all i really wanted to try were the paper filters , the plastic is not environmentally friendly i have a reusable keurig filter but it is messy to clean after use the paper filters work great in it i can use my own coffee , which is not available through keurig i 've asked if the paper filters could be bought separately but never got a response . 
i have read mixed reviews on the disposakups , so i had no expectations i would like to say that the product has worked perfectly maybe the issue with some users is that they are not pressing the lid on tight enough or are not allowing the filter to hang over the edge and be sealed in place by the lid there was no leaking at all and i have used 10 cups already i also read that the coffee does not seem to be as strong as regular brew that is true , probably due to the type of grind my resolution to the issue is to have a regular coffee cup in place , but choose the smallest cup on the keurig , which gives you roughly half a cup of coffee lift the handle as though you are going to remove the kcup and just push it back down and brew a second tiny cup into the already brewed cup viola ! perfect i definitely recommend and will certainly purchase again . 
i have given this product five stars because it works very well for coffee with the filters that come with it br br but my five stars come with a warning do n't use these little cups without using the little filters , especially with teas or tea based coffee substitutes \( like loose teeccino \) the tea leaves swell to a far greater extent than water logged , ground coffee beans they also swell much faster , which tends to clog the small , unprotected puncture at the bottom of the little cups so , not using the filter is a very , very dumb idea if you put less tea in the little cups , the tea still clogs the system without the filters ! br br so be wise , and use the cups with the filters br br for what it 's worth , though , the solo my k cup works perfectly with all types of contents , with or without the little filters it 's ridiculously expensive , however happily , for me , who am not flowing with dough , the plastic cups \( with the little filters \) are an answer . 
these cups are simple and easy to use the only drawback is the fact that maybe 1 3 of the cups get caught in the unit when you open however , they are easy to remove once you just close and reopen . 
it is just like a k cup no ground left in the bottom of my coffee makes a strong , hot cup of joe the cup melts to the shape of your coffee maker it works wonderfully , but when i did the math for saving a few bucks the whole reason i went looking for an alternative it is just about the same as buying the prepackaged cups \( i try to buy the k cups around 28 \) , except you can choose your own coffee and you have to measure it out now i have not used all 50 cups yet so i will see if some of my coffee is left over and then it might be a little cheaper the breakdown 18 dollars for the disposable cups \( shipping included \) , and 10 for my favorite coffee time to fill the cups environmentally wasteful we need a better solution the reusable filters received mixed reviews , but i might give it a shot . 
i purchased these on a whim , and after researching for other disposable products i have the single mesh filter plastic re usable one , but the convenience factor of a disposable is not there you have to then clean it and all that mess with this product , simply pop a filter \( included into the cup , \( included \) fill it with 1 2tsp of your own blend , or folgers starbucks , anything and use the included cup holder to pop a lid on \( which are also included \) i bought 50 and am now so happy with these i'm ordering 200 more why \? \? because for the 12 15 you spend on these cups you can make 50 coffee 's if you have some regular coffee in your fridge , use that you can even say a bag of starbucks breakfast blend ground is around 10 00 , so your at 22 00 , thats only 2 boxes of 12 kcups coffee 's and you can fill 75 100 on a single 1lb bag , a 1 5lb tub of folgers can fill about 400 of these refills for 9 00 for the tub so go for it , you wo n't regret it br br one thing i want to point out is the included filters do hang out the edges a bit , nothing wrong , it just adds to the seal , and depending on your brewers strength you can see seepage after brewing a cup , but who cares , they are disposable if you are a total cheap wad you can pop the lids off and use the cups again if you do n't mind a whole in the bottom from where the brewer pops it but your freshness wo n't last with a re used cup hope this review helps ! ! ! thanks ! . 
handy cups were easy to fill using the enclosed stand and performed quite well lids fit snugly and ran well through my keurig machine . 
works great so much easier to use than the one you buy for the machine less mess just throw it away ! . 
what can i say they just work no muss no fuss fill the cup pop the top on and save money . 
so glad that someone came up with these we had experimented with several ways to make a filter for the fill your own kup that came with the keurig and nothing worked these are great and we like the coffee we use much better than the kups from keurig the only problem with the disposacups is that sometimes the folds on the paper filters prevent you from securing the lid to remedy this , i spread the folds out a little more , then the lid snaps right on great product , saves a ton of money and , we reuse the cup and only replace the lid and filter ! . 
these cups are usable as stated they are exactly what i was looking for which was a less expensive method to have coffee they do leak slightly but not too bad not sure if it makes the hole 's a little larger than the prepackaged cups but on the high side , i do get the have the coffee that i want , the way i want it which is great . 
i fill up a dozen of these with dd dark and take them to work for my afternoon cup i use eko \( not solofil \) at home for my breakfast dose these do the job , are very economical , and i only have a problem with a bit of grinds run through if the machine is dirty they need to be wiped down every do often , and do n't let the needles plug up . 
these cups are great i have been reusing the originals and putting aluminum foil for the top these make it much easier and you can reuse them also . 
this was a return buy i bought 50 to try and loved them this time i ordered 150 00 they are fab for your favorite coffee . 
great way to use your own coffee rather than buying k cups they are great because you do n't have to change out the holding tray and there is no mess , u just toss them like you would a k kup , no washing out of the filter every time it would be nice if there were not 3 parts to the process \( filter already in cup \) i just load up 10 at a time and am set for the week . 
it took a couple of tries to figure out how to snap on the cap and a couple of tries to tell how much coffee to put in it for the strength preferred after that , it is economical and not much trouble . 
this is a great idea , but i find that the grounds get into the coffee , and the coffee does n't come out of the maker as nice as the regular kcups it is messy as it comes out and misses the mug it still is nice but is not quite as good as the orginal . 
i am very happy with the disposacup single serve brewers the item arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect packaging now i can brew my favorite brand of coffee anytime i want . 
received the order very fast the lids are a little hard to get on but they work fine it 's a good way to use your own brand of coffee if you like . 
i picked these up for my wife so she could make coffee out of any brand she likes they work perfectly in her new keurig that i got her for christmas you could n't ask for better . 
we have had a keurig mini brewer for over 2 years and the family really likes it ! we all have different tastes and we like the idea of preparing a cup of our choice , without wasting an entire pot we enjoy hot chocolate , hot tea , iced tea , and , of course , coffee but , even then , we like a good cup of morning coffee , flavored coffee during the day , and decaf at night so the pot is in use constantly and with a variety of goodies br br i was given a gourmet assortment of ground coffee , and it has been sitting on the shelf for quite awhile but , now , thanks to the disposable k cups , i am finally able to experiment with some lovely new flavors , while the stuffy die hards in the family can stay with their favorite brew as soon as i saw the disposable k cups and filters i knew i had to order this product it 's easy to use disposable and it 's just as fast to make a cup of delicious coffee in this container as it is to stand over the two drawer rack trying to decide which flavor to choose we are very happy with this product ! . 
these k cups really save money i can have the coffee i like and my husband can have his delivery was quick and product exactly as described will be buying more ! . 
i really like them , but they are sort of hard to put the lid on without crushing the cup wish that was easier . 
i love these little disposakups ! it seems everywhere i go , people have a keurig at work , my daughters , and my girl friends all have a keurig except , my favorirte coffee does n't come in a premade k cup so with an espresso grind and these disposakups i can bring my favorite keurig coffee any where i go ! have disposakups , will travel ! . 
this is a great product and you provided great customer service thanks so much for the opportunity to purchase this item . 
my husband recently bought me a keurig brewer i was excited for my new toy but my joy quickly turned into dismay when i saw how expensive the little cups cost i love coffee and have always bought beans to grind i was delighted when i found these wonderful little disposable filters to use with my brewer now i have the best of both worlds ! br i placed my order and to my surprise they showed up 3 days later ! . 
i was happy to get the disposacups and look forward to using them i really like the paper filters i am wondering if the cups can be used again i know the lid ca n't i will see what happens with this for future uses . 
they work great , now i can use my on coffee and that is nice only four littlt steps cup filter coffee lid . 
we have a michigan based coffee cafe \( now renamed biggby 's \) that stomps starbucks \( biggby 's was originally named beaners , a name that encountered resistance as the franchise spread \) their br dark roasts are to die for none of the k cups come close \( except possibly for g m espresso \) so this build it yourself k cup is a near perfect solution the downside is that the brewing takes much longer and there is a bit of splatter also the caps are a bit difficult to snap down recommended . 
i bought these to be able to use my favorite coffess and lessen the expensive of the prefilled k cups it little bit more time consuming than the prefilled cups , but if you make several at a time , they work great . 
the disposakups are great because i can use my own brand coffee and adjust the strength of it the only thing that needs to be improved on is that the edges of the filter need to be trimmed down to prevent leakage at first try it is a little difficult to get the tops on but after a few times of doing it , it becomes easier the price is a little steep for me but much less than buying the already filled k kups i feel sure that i will order this product again br br a href http www amazon com gp product b004tsazo0 disposakups for keurig k cup brewers 50 cups , lids , filters 100 disposable free prime shipping a . 
this is a really good product i had a little trouble the first couple times because i didnt tighten the lid down but besides that it is a good item . 
the disposable k cups allow me to use my own coffee with the keurig single cup coffee maker , better than others i have tried . 
these disposable cups are great ! the simple , clean method of a portion pack but with your own grounds now i need to see if they pack them in larger quantities the seller was also great i got what i wanted and ahead of time also no issues to report here anyone with the k cup system needs to get this product from this seller . 
we ordered these because we love our new keurig coffee maker , , , , but as we drink alot of coffee found that buying the kcups are way too expensive , , , , with these we can use our regular coffee in these disposable cups they are still not fun to fill , , , , \( not as easy as just reaching for a pre made one \) but are far more economical than the pre made ones they delivery was on time and as promised . 
i really was n't too sure this product would work it has surpassed all my expectations i will never buy the ready made k cups again this is truly a genius product ! . 
they are everything i expected except for one flaw i had trouble keeping the lever completely down on the machine great product and my brother was excited also and i gave him a box i hope they are in stores soon such an ease to use , great idea , no clean up just throw away . 
works great seems to work wonders lid is tight and some times hard to put on when you get the hang of it easy i 'll buy again . 
purchased these for our new coffee machine they work very good no issues using these with our regular coffee is a plus . 
these were just what i was looking for , however , when using in my cuisinart they leak and back up water which spurts out in different areas of my k cup area i do n't want to ruin my machine , so i'm trying different things with this disposable cup , i e , smaller amount of coffee , packing it looser , and smaller amount of water for cup size still leaks some , but it 's getting better as before i had about 3 to 4 areas of dripping water coffee , some hitting inside the coffee cup and several outside of coffee cup . 
i am impressed at how easy these are to use , much better than the one that you can buy from keurig br great company to buy from when i go through these will reorder again . 
i had a kerig before and it broke the company said it was because i was using expresso in the k cup and it was to fine and cloged the machine kerig does not make a k cup with spanish coffee so when i found these i was very happy i have been using these for about a month and i love them and it is so much cheaper i would highly recommend these . 
i love these cups my husband and i like community coffee from back home unfortunately , no kkup in their line yet these diapisables are perfect they perform just as reliably as the standard k cups with the economy and convienance of your own bulk coffees . 
i have n't had a chande to actually try the k cups to see if they work as advertised however the order arrived on time and in excellent condition for this a gave the 4 star rating if the cups work as advertised , then this rating will jump to 5 stars . 
http www amazon com gp product b004k30ho2 ref cm cr rev prod title br br http www amazon com gp product b004k30ho2 ref cm cr rev prod title br disposalkups this product i highly reccommend i recieved my first 50 cups and filled them with my own coffee and they worked great i now ordered another 50 cups beings i liked them so much and not only that do the math br 50 cups for 10 and change vs 18 24 cups for 10 and change br br and i will continue to order again thank u for coming up with this . 
love these cups ! i hated paying so much for my beloved keurig coffees , the cups work great , they are convenient , easy to use and i can use whatever coffee i choose ! ! ! ! ! . 
my family has been enjoying bug bites organic chocolates for years i highly recommend both the milk chocolate and the dark chocolate varieties they are very smooth and rich , and not the least bit waxy tasting like some of the more popular american chocolates each individually packaged bite is the perfect size for an adult and maybe a little more than a mouthful for a young child each tiny package contains a special treat a tiny insect card which features a color photograph and interesting facts if you have a budding entomologist on your hands , these are the perfect treat ! the endangered species company is environmentally conscious too , and dedicates 10 of their net profit to support species and habitat preservation . 
the candy is ordinary milk chocolate , but i was very glad to have an organic option to hand out for halloween i love the idea of including a little nature education with it , but i was a little disappointed in the text on the insect card i saw , which was not well written and had almost nothing to do with the moth that was pictured but it 's more than you get with most candy . 
i hate bugs , but i adore these bug bites chocolate squares ! the chocolate is smooth and sweet , and small enough to be a daily indulgence plus , each square comes with a tiny insect flashcard with a photo and factoids for your favorite entomologist br br pull the trigger on this one your sweet tooth will thank you . 
i put this in my dog 's stocking for christmas he was very pleased with the snack he likes regular sweet potato fries , so i thought a package of dog ones would make him happy . 
this was a new product for our 2 kids they liked them so well we even thought of trying them ! great price , and obviously a new favorite ! . 
over the years , i have become an expert on chocolate covered raisins for something so simple , it 's surprising how difficult it is to find one that is truly exceptional in some , the chocolate is too waxy and tasteless in others , the raisins are too small or dried out kirkland chocolate covered raisins are just right the raisins are large and moist , and the chocolate is high quality i used to think that brach 's made a good one , until i had these br br if you or someone you know is a chocolate covered raisin fan , this is one you must try the tub is huge and the price is less than boutique chocolatiers want for a small bag of theirs it is an outstanding value and i doubt you will be disappointed br br i have no affiliation with kirkland or anyone else i'm just a chocolate raisin fan who knows when he has a great raisin and these are truly wonderful . 
these are definitely the best chocolate raisins out there they are the perfect balance of chocolate and raisin and my boyfriend wo n't have any others too many brands have a ton of chocolate around an itty bitty raisin what 's the point \? these are great and a treat ! . 
when i was in high school , my mother would always have these around the house living in the dorms , i usually only ever find small , overpriced packages of chocolate covered rasins this is perfect for satisfying my cravings ! it stores very well i 've had mine about a month and they taste the same as when i first opened them delicious ! . 
these chocolate covered raisins are amazing there is a nice balance between raisins and chocolate i always pick up a container when i am shopping at bj 's wholesale . 
i have ordered these raisins multiple times they are always great and arrive timely i ca n't go back to store bought chocolate covered raisins now ! love this product . 
oh dear , there are n't words to express my feelings for this product it 's absolutely terrific the chocolate melts in your mouth revealing the perfect raisin inside you can let them sit in your mouth and savor the moment , or chew through two quickly before throwing more in your mouth i usually do the latter br br i 've never been able to find a comparable milk chocolate raisin product so i always end up coming back to these they 're sold at big discount warehouses and also on amazon perfect . 
this dog food is a keeper i have to buy special dog food for my dog because he has allergies to chicken and brown rice br my vet prescribed an iams brand food with kangaroo meat in it my dog did n't really care for the taste but he ate it br i wanted something more natural , so i looked up flint river ranch fish chips what frustrates me , is how you have to wean your dog off of the old food br to gradually get used to the new he liked the flavor so much , he ate around the old dog food and only ate the flint river fish chips fortunately , his tummy handled br the new food really well we have no problem getting him to eat and i like that he does n't have to eat a larger serving to get the same nutrition i will definitely order br flint river ranch fish chips again , and soon i recommend it highly . 
i became a fan for dave 's gourmet dave 's burning nuts about 3 years ago this is a very addicting snack a hefty dose of heat with just the right amount of saltiness i 've introduced them to a number of my co workers who are now big fans i have tried the other spicy nut products on the market , but so far , dave 's is by far the champ ! . 
okay , i'm eating these nuts as i write this review br br and as another review noted , these are pretty addictive however , i caution you in advance after a few hand fulls of these , you will be running around your house trying to find something to drink to put that fire out in your mouth if you like some heat and are a peanut fan you will not be disappointed br br would write more but i need a drink ! ! ! fire in my mouth br br holy hot nuts ! ! ! . 
awesome tasting nuts ! love them \? will be ordering them again the entire neighborhood wants to eat them all but i am stingy . 
i 've given these to friends that do n't eat spicy and they wanted to kill me afterwards actually one person did not want to speak to me at work for a week these are pretty spicy i 'll normally sit down and eat maybe 20 30 at a time and that 's it if you 're a fan of dave 's hot sauces then you owe it to yourself to get this 4 pack it 's also a great gift or stocking stuffer . 
if you want hot peanuts , this is your product i have tried several other brands , and these peanuts seem to pack the most punch and have a fantastics taste . 
amazon has the best price in town hot nuts that do n't disappoint i would recommend trying dave 's other items as well great flavor . 
these are some pretty darn good nuts with some spicy bite they wont change your life , but they are good the double entendre in the name is a serious bonus . 
i 've tried pretty much every pepper covered peanut \( or cashew \) on the market and these are by far the best you 'd better like spicy though . 
i have been buying these habenero peanuts for some time and they are very good and , unfortunately , as advertised , they are also very addictive ! br br \( i am consuming them as i speak electronically \) br br fortunately , they are much better now since i can order them from amazon where i get a much better price and low two day shipping with my membership br br this is not a paid advertisement br br john . 
dave 's nuts are fantastic hot , spicy crunchy , and habit forming br br no babies , frail women , or wimpy men need to order ! . 
yummy that should be all my review says but really , these are just that , yummy i am 10 weeks pregnant and have n't felt like eating much these last few weeks , but tonight , the night before i have to fast for a blood draw , i was craving some banana moon pies off to the store i went and bought a box of these mini moon pies the perfect size ! ! you do n't feel as bad eating two of them because they are so small , and eating 4 of them is kinda like eating 2 of the bigger ones , not that i did that or anything haha go get your banana moon pies today you wo n't regret it ! ! . 
this is absolutely the best tasting coffee i have ever drank ! i ca n't find it locally , thankfully amazon has saved me once again .

great coffee this was way too much to pay for it , but i could not find it anywhere else at the time i feel a taken advantage of price wise and probably would not order again . 
i just went to ralph 's international market , formerly niagara distributing , located at 3701 n 29th avenue , hollywood , florida , i got 3 pounds of sahlen 's for 15 99 , they also have 5 pounds for 25 99 they have more buffalo favorites , chivetta 's sauce , hot sauce check them out ! . 
i figure i would brag , i live in buffalo and just got 3lbs for 7 98 ! but seriously the best hot dogs ever . 
i agree with gary s it perishable so it need to be ship over night i ordered 5 pounds and i got it the next day thanks citymade inc . 
these sahlen's smokehouse hotdogs are totally yummy they have a lighter flavour than the all beef hotdogs i am used to and are not as unduly salty ! the delicious smoked taste is there , all right but it is not overpowering , and will not burn your tongue ! just a nice , subtle flavour and this all means not only are they delicious , but also that you wo n't go looking for gallons of water , \( or soda , or whatever \) , after you eat a few br br these are big , substantial hot dogs if you want yours in a hot dog bun , it will probably not only fill the bun , but some of the hot dog will stick out at either end ! br br if you wnat to take the wrapping \( skin \) , off the hot dog , this is not easily done but then , it 's not easily done with any of the other hot dogs i 've ever tried , either but it is easier to take off at least part of the plastic wrapping and just the plastic wrapping , leaving the hot dog itself , totally intact with thes sahlen 's smokehouse hotdogs , than it has ever been my experience with any other hot dogs \( maybe if i had more patience , i would indeed have been able to take more of or even all of the plastic wrap off but these hot dogs are so yummy , such will , i fear , never be the case ! \) br br these hot dogs are conveniently wrapped two together so you will not be taking the entire contents out , when you want just one , or two at least , you wo n't do this inadvertently but once tasting these delightful hot dogs , you may be sorely tempted to do this deliberately br br br br on one of oprah winfrey 's earliest programs , she and some guests went to a very br elite restaurant spagos i'm sure i'm not the only audience member who had never head of spago 's before then recently , i learnt that pizza at spagos is br filled with smoked salmon ! this makes spago 's pizza the non plus ultra of pizzas , i'm sure ! br br for non plus ultra , \( absolutely no better \) hot dogs , sahlen's smokehouse hot dogs , just have to be the ones sahlen 's has been making , \( and probably , perfecting \) , hot dogs , since 1869 , \( 140 years \) so , for the ultimate hot dog , on a par with spago 's pizza , \( for pizza \) , tetley 's classic blend , \( for tea bags \) , maxwell house arabica blend decaf instant coffee , \( for instant coffee \) , guylian chocolate sea shells , \( for chocolate \) , and other such top of the tastebuds foods , it 's sahlen's smokehouse hotdogs , for hotdogs br br yes they are that good ! . 
this is one of the best hot dogs made , unfortunatally it is not widely available citymade must be off their rocker if they think people are gonna sale hot dogs for such a crazy price granted there is 30 weiners in a package , still a stupid price . 
a friend gave me a tea bag to try while at work yesterday i accidentally oversteeped the tea and expected a very strong bitter brew i was very happy with the smoothness of this tea while it was quite strong , nothing was overpowering and the bitterness i expected was not present at all br br my 2nd brewing was done with more care this tea has an exceptionally smooth taste and excellent flavor i 'll be buying ahmad tea in the future . 
i just loved the tea we just add a little honey and sit back and relax it has a slight citrus flavor which i find very refresshing . 
i spent along time and a lot of money looking for a great earl grey to this point its been loose leaf tea i order from another site until my girl friend went to london with her family bring me back a small sample pack of 10 tea bags i loved it so much i had gotten this 6 pack of 20 count boxes which i have polished off and reordered since then br br the tea stays fresh in the foil package each tea bag which makes it so air and light cant damage the flavor of the tea which is the problem is loose leaf tea 's br br the flavor of the tea is a nice bergamot flavor which is smooth no matter how long you leave the tea in i perfer mine strong and straight up each sit is as good as the first i will keep buying this tea and also try other ones by ahmad of london . 
i love ahmad tea the earl grey is a wonderful tea for an afternoon sipping the bergamot flavour is n't overpowering like some other brands i have tried br br i will be buying more of this wonderful tea . 
presentation is yous perfect and product really fresh , tea bags came inside individualized plasticized aluminum bag making them to be ever fresh i will buy other kind of teas from this seller , hopefully they must be as excellent as the earl grey one . 
having tried a very large number of earl grey teas , i 've been struck by how particularly flavorful this brand is it 's really worth trying i ended up buying the pack of 6 boxes twice i liked it so much . 
for any tea lover , \( we became fans in england \) ahmad tea pleases immensely i we have sampled tea from quite a few vendors but after our son brought a pack of ahmad tea back with him \( from jolly old \) as a gift , we were sold we found the flavor splendid we loved it it is fully flavored and needs no sugar milk sweetener at all \( and i usually needed sweeteners with the other brands of earl grey , so \) br buying it from amazon is a very economical solution and delivery was expediant i highly recommend , if you enjoy hot tea , try this brand ! br mac , br please excuse any spelling errors , that may have occurred in my haste , and no spell check help heheheh ta ta earl grey hot jlp . 
this is my wife 's absolute favorite earl grey me , i find that while the bergamot flavor is nice , i like a tea base that is a bit brisker . 
nice serving size , good complement to breakfast low in fat , high in protein , and taste great i keep the unused portion in the freezer and microwave them , or heat them in a pan if you want a crispier outside they are pre cooked love 'em ! . 
i love kristian regale black currant sparkling drink so thought i 'd try the peach i never know if i'm going to get a syrupy sweet flavor when i get peach flavored items , but this was really good somewhat tart , and tastes like fresh peaches the bubbles are tiny so not like regular sodas , but a 'grown up' sparkling beverage i will order this again , and would have no trouble giving this as a gift if i did n't drink it all first ! ! i hope amazon gets the pear flavored \( not the listing for 50 bucks , either i'm sure that would be good as well but the peach and black currant are definite winners ! ! . 
was surprised of the inexpensive price tag and skeptical when purchased as it turns out , it is a charming and unique gift and a great buy for the price ! . 
really good mix pleasantly surprised to find it includes macadamia nuts we will enjoy this mix immensely i am sure we will order it again . 
this is a fantastic product , arrived fresh and it 's a good price with subscribe and save i will be keeping this subscription . 
i thought these had avery good flavor i took two tubs to work and most of the people liked them two or three people commented that they liked them better than some other brands because they are not salty . 
the stuff is great but i 'll pay at most 4 or 5 for four bottles . 
the grapefruit and blackberry flavors are the current favorite at my house on tuesday nights when we try to always have a rotisserie chicken and homemade gravy while watching tv br br once you taste the subtle fruit flavors mingling perfectly in a not overly carbonated sparkling water , you may want to order this by the case br br there are no artificial flavorings or colorings , not to mention extra sugar the only sweetener is grape juice and apple juice concentrate lemon juice and fruit concentrates mingle with the sparkling water to create a delicate , smooth , slightly tingly and delicious drink br br perfect for drinking with dinner or taking along on a picnic br br the rebecca review . 
i just purchased this today for 3 99 i ca n't believe this price the product is wonderful however nice soda like fizz , but juicy instead of cloyingly sweet . 
izze sparkling grapefruit soda is absolutely delicious , even though it is not 100 flavored with grapefruit juice it 's amazing that such a strong , mellow grapefruit taste can come from a mixture of fruit juices however , the totaly effect is explosively great not too tart , not too sweet and wonderfully refreshing br br it 's perfect on its own own or with a snack because it 's not overpowering , it 's just the right touch to add to your meals if you 're tired of drinking beverages with ingredients that you ca n't pronounce , izze sparkling grapefruit soda is the drink for you br br it 's a healthy alternative to chemical laden sodas ! . 
this product is excellent at my local store , they struggle to keep enough on the shelves it is usually priced at 4 99 for 4 bottles , which is expensive as it is i would try not to spend more than this . 
my teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon ! they 're obviously addicted to the stuff a very unhealthy habit br br i ca n't drink soda pop myself , it 's been 5 years or so since i had one , and so i began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop , but was n't unhealthy i searched high and low for a suitable alternative and then i found izze br br i love the fruity , tangy flavor of izze 's sparkling grafefruit soda the grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods , but it is also great just by itself br br my teens love izze and drink it now just like soda pop ! i'm so happy to know they are n't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors , but instead are enjoying all natural izze , with no added sweeetners ! br br if you 're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop you ca n't do better than to buy izze . 
izze is fantastic i tried it three days ago , and have n't been anywhere without a can or bottle of it since it could quite possibly be the world 's most perfect beverage nothing artificial , ingredients that you can pronounce , and a taste you just cannot beat slightly tart and slightly sweet , this light , bubbly drink should be experienced by everyone at least once . 
i'm not much of a soda drinker , but i enjoy a good natural fruit soda in the summertime izze describes their sodas as 100 pure fruit juice and sparkling water that 's an exaggeration , as there are a few more natural ingredients beside fruit juice and water in these drinks but the description is apt in that izze 's drinks are more sparkling fruit juices than sodas they are lightly carbonated , not super fizzy and the best of them taste like fresh fruit the sparkling grapefruit will be a fast favorite of grapefruit fans , because it tastes like fresh squeezed pink grapefruit juice , but lighter and a little sweeter it 's a little tart a little sweet a little fizzy very refreshing it 's like drinking fresh grapefruit juice , only better there 's never any trace of sourness no refined sugar , artificial ingredients , or caffeine either 12 fl oz glass bottles br br ingredients sparkling water , grape juice concentrate , grape fruit juice concentrate , lemon juice concentrate , natural flavor , gum acacia \( from acacia trees \) , ester gum , red cabbage extract \( color \) one serving \( which is 8 fl oz \) contains 10 mg sodium and 25 g total carbs . 
if you are a chamomile tea drinker , you will be happy to discover this tea the citrus addition makes for a full bodied but smooth tea definitely the best chamomile tea on the market also , i brew one bag in a coffee maker dedicated to tea only , and get a whole pot out of each bag you wo n't be disappointed in this one . 
this tea was a gift we are down to the last two tea bags , and i had been unable to find it alas , it was on the find anything site amazon this particular herbal blend does n't sound particularly appealing , but one taste and you will be hooked a smooth , complex blend just lovely . 
our little chihuahuas are picky eaters i really do n't find canned foods helpful , since they wo n't eat any that has been put in the refrigerator overnight these are perfect because we can split a single package and mix it in with the kibble even better , when we travel , these are easy to open and carry br br of all of the selections , the beef chicken combo is their favorite ! they always gobble this one up right away . 
i must be in love if i'm mulling over a 12 pack of big bags for myself i love the crunch , intense curry flavor , seediness , and the fact they are gluten free these are one of the more original savory snacks you can find they 're very hard so you need good teeth and i love the substantial curry flavor that is not kind of indian tasting . 
i just love these have tried several flavors gives a gluten freer a chance to snack on a crunchy , healthy snack ! ! . 
i have been snacking on the crackers from this line , for a long time now , and someone suggested that i try these sticks twigs i love everything about them ! i love the crunch and the texture of them , and , of course , i love the taste of them , especially with the curry flavor ! they are not only delicious , but they are also very nutricious , with lots of protein and fiber in them they make the perfect snack ! . 
sticks and twigs may seem a little pricey compared to regular pretzels , but the bag lasts a long time and the ingredients , like flax seeds , quinoa , chia seeds and curry , are good for you they are very crunchy , but tasty for some added protein , i like to dip them in peanut butter . 
picked these up on a recent trip loved the spice ! br br organic , non gmo , vegan , dairy free , wheat free , gluten free , whole grain , kosher , no hydrogenated oils , no trans fats and contains 550 mg of omega 3 fatty acids per 1oz serving extremely crunchy and satisfying using organic short grain brown rice , organic whole quinoa , organic brown flax seeds , organic brown sesame seeds , organic whole amaranth , organic whole millet , filtered water , sea salt , organic curry powder , organic chia seeds and that 's all br br if you are accustomed to eating healthy , whole foods and have good teeth you will adore these for snacking . 
i was extremely impressed with the single serve pecan pies i expected a middle of the road product , thought i 'd give them a try br the ratio of filling to crust thickness is perfect pie has a rich home baked flavor , and the size is wonderful 2 ounces is large enough to enjoy without ruining diet it 's satisfying without being overly sweet br i will be ordering more next month to give one to each guest to take home after thanksgiving dinner . 
my father lives 3 , 000 miles from me , and i used to order a pecan pie from swiss colony and have it shipped to him for christmas each year but when the item was discontinued a few years ago , i had trouble finding another company that could deliver a delicious , homemade pie that was guaranteed to be fresh when it arrived i gave nell davis a shot last christmas , and could not have been more pleased i missed the deadline to guarantee the order would arrive by christmas , but sure enough , my father was quite surprised when he got not one , but six mini pies on christmas eve morning he said they were wonderful and he gobbled down all six in one sitting ! i 've definitely found my new holiday pie company , thank you nell davis ! . 
ok this poor guy begged my daughter to make him my pecan pie and well she is a microwave girl ! so for christmass what better way to a man than his stomach he now has pies he can pack in his lunch box they are sssooooo good . 
they were packaged so perfect and omg if there were 100 stars , i would give them 100 stars , they are out of this world the crust melts in you mouth and the filling is perfect and delicious and scrumptious , the filling is not chintzy yet not too sweet i used to make them when i was a kid with my mother for christmas but they never came out like these i bet there is not one comment that is less than 5 they taste just like they look they are beyond delicious and i allow myself one or two a day if you 're hesitating about how good they are , one bite and you 'll know yuuuuuuuuuuum ! ! ! ! ! . 
we only like white popcorn , and the only grocery store option where we live is jolly time , which is not bad for fun , we started ordering various white popcorns online , and this is by far the very best white popcorn ! ! wish it were a little less expensive , but we 've decided that it really is that much better than others we are now snappy white popcorn snobs ! \) . 
snappy white popcorn is excellent it pops up nicely , and has a great texture it is extremely fresh as for taste it is 100 times better than the store brands \( imo \) give it a try . 
although the kernels may not be as large and fluffy when popped , we really enjoyed our first pop has a great flavor and consistency br we recommend using a hot air popper over a microwave we had very few no pops . 
i 've always bought yellow popcorn , but after reading the reviews for snappy white i decided to give it a try it 's tender and delicious ! i 'll be ordering more , it 's now my favorite popcorn . 
i purchased a hot air popcorn popper because my kids love popcorn , and it 's a healthy snack br br i 'accidentally' ordered the white popcorn , having no idea what i was doing , and i have to say that no other popcorn compares we went through the entire container when i re ordered , i decided to try the regular yellow popcorn , and it just was n't the same if i could describe the difference , i would say that yellow popcorn tastes 'stale' in comparison the white popcorn tastes crisper and more fresh br br as for the flavor , well , we use kernel seasons seasoning generously , so we do n't taste much more than the cheddar cheese \) br br i'm considering giving the rest of this yellow popcorn tub away so i have an excuse to buy another tub of the white popcorn br br for how we eat it , this popcorn is absolutely the best ! br br note i also recommend the misto oil spray we use this and kernel seasons as a healthy alternative to butter . 
just ate my first batch and it 's as good as any white popcorn i have had i encountered difficulty obtaining white popcorn from grocery stores and was reduced to eating the horrible yellow type luckily i decided to shop this site , and i could not be more pleased you will not be disappointed br br next time i will order two four pound jars plus the snappy popcorn white cheddar shaker , and get free shipping for a purchase over 25 which is important because the shipping charges are significant . 
snappy 's white popcorn is perfect it 's hulless , tiny , tender and crunchy when popped , and it always pops we keep it in the freezer so it 's always fresh , and more importantly , always here when we want some as midwesterners , we know corn , okay \? and this is the best ! . 
i tried thhis popcorn in a the presto poplite air popcorn machine the instructions were easy and the results were very gratifying i added sea salt and a little olive oil the measuring container made 5 quarts i just could n't stop eating it simply delicious . 
this popcorn leaves very few old maids it 's fresh , so the kernels pop as bi as they should \( unlike some other brands i 've purchased \) my only criticism is that there are lots of hulls but of the three brands of popcorn i 've recently bough for use in my microwave popcorn popper , it 's the best . 
i am on my second 4 lb canister of this the popcorn has a good yield , few unpopped kernals , similar to popcorn from the grocery store the popped kernals are larger than normal for most white popcorn br br i have mild ibs and i find white popcorn is easier on my digestive track versus yellow \( i think because the shells are thinner and softer \) , this popcorn follows the trend for me and i can consume popcorn every day when i am in a popcorn mood . 
for my daughter 's birthday i ordered her a stir crazy popcorn maker i was busy and knew i did n't have time to run to the grocery store i ordered the popcorn on line too we made the popcorn using organic coconut oil we were shocked to see almost every kernel popped 1 2 cup and the popper was full the popcorn was big and fluffy the flavor was good the first time we put butter and salt on it the second time just salt and it was great ! we placed it in baggies and took it to the movies okay so maybe that sounds a bit cheap however our popcorn was fresh , tasty , and healthy as compared to the movie theater popcorn . 
we are white popcorn enthusiasts , and were very pleased with this product large , tender kernels of poped corn used an electric , self stirring poper worth the cost . 
snappy white popcorn is one of the best popcorn i have ever tried very tasty and most every kernel pops every time . 
i was sick of microwave popcorn so i ordered this , hoping it would take me back to the popcorn i loved in years past that it did almost every kernel pops and with butter , i'm happy ! br i get my oil hot first and pop about a third of a cup of corn each time it pops quickly just be there to get it into a bowl as soon as the popping stops or it will burn . 
i love this brand \( i ordered 1st via amazon \) great , fluffy corn , with very few un popped kernels in my hot air popper did n't try the old fashioned fry pan method , but expect similar results definitely will buy again when needed . 
very good popcorn ! i believe even better than orville 's brand a little on the expensive side but you do get a lot of popcorn . 
i bought this with the presto 04830 powerpop microwave multi popper back in july and have been very , very pleased almost no kernels left in the bottom and fluffy , large popcorn getting ready to reorder so i thought i would pass it on a href http www amazon com gp product b00005ibxk presto 04830 powerpop microwave multi popper a . 
my sister turned me on to white popcorn over yellow popcorn br br she said it was more tender however did not pop as large br br guess she had some store bought stuff br br i put the same amount in as walley world yellow popcorn and it blew the lid off the pot ! br br i'm a convert to this brand of white popcorn ! . 
this popcorn pops up light , fluffy , and crunchy i have been using orville redenbacher white popcorn , but this is slightly less expensive and very tasty and fresh my popcorn method is as follows br use a westbend stir crazy 6 qt popper it is the best because it gets hot quickly without smoking or burning the corn br then use 2 tablespoons of olive oil , flavacol to taste \( i use about a teaspoon \) put the oil and flavacol in the popper and plug it in add approximately 3 4 cup of snappy white popcorn when the popping stops enjoy a large batch of great popcorn with very little fat , and what fat there is will be monosaturated a href http www amazon com gp product b00004rc6r west bend 82306 stir crazy 6 quart electric popcorn popper a a href http www amazon com gp product b004w8lt10 gold medal prod 2045 flavacol seasoning popcorn salt 35oz a . 
we only like white popcorn and since it 's hard to find in the grocery store it 's great to order this it was yummy and plentiful ! recommend ! . 
good big , crisp , snowy white kernels with few duds pops quickly , 25 faster than name brand yellow corn in the same microwave and popper decent price and package size enough to last awhile not so much as to go stale before it runs out br br bad almost tasteless butter and salt are not optional br br orville redenbacher still leads the pack , but this stuff is pretty good and costs a lot less four stars would have been five if it were even a little less bland . 
i ordered several kinds of highly rated popcorn from amazon at one time i admit i was skeptical of some of the rave reviews well the snappy white popcorn arrived first so i tried it immediately i actually measured \( i usually just eye ball it \) 3 t canola oil , 1 3 cup snappy popcorn and 1 3 tsp flavacol flavored salt i put the oil and flavacol in my trusty whirly pop popper and swirled to distribute the flavacol i then added the popcorn it popped really quickly , snowy white and fluffy it was divine tender , not greasy or chewy and so flavorful i will update this post when i try the other brands i ordered to let you know how it stacks up oh , and i had one kernel that did n't pop ! . 
this is the wondeful white popcorn we ate in iowa years ago ! i am so glad to find it and what a great price too ! br i got it today and popped some right away i used the microwave popcorn bowl i bought from amazon , put a tablespoonful of extra virgin olive oil and two tablespoonsful of the popcorn in the bowl br i placed the bowl , with lid on , in the mw and turned it on for 1 minute and then pushed the popcorn button to pop it br after moving the popped corn to another bowl i shook the shaker with the popcorn seasoning several times and oh what a delicious hulless treat ! the hulls seem to have vanished during the popping i felt nor found any br and all of the items i used , including the microwave , i bought from amazon . 
this is great popcorn ! ! ! i just purchased a second batch i never had a problem w a ton of kernels left in my air popper or many hulls as long as this is being produced and sold i will be a buyer ! br br the only con i have is that the only seal on the canister is a small piece of tape on the lid canister i was surprised to not see some type of freshness seal like you would see on a ketchup bottle surprisingly though i had no issues with humidity effecting the corn \( maybe because i'm in a dryer climate \? \) . 
i ordered this popping corn after being disappointed with the local big box store selection two brands one of them tasted chalky like styrofoam and its claim was larger popped kernels no taste br br i mainly use this popcorn with one of those plastic microwave popping bowls i noticed that 1 3 cup yields more cooked popcorn than two other brands i have tried it kept on popping after my usual 2 minute and 20 second routine when using microwave poppers , you tend to get some burnt kernels if you extend the cooking time for maximum popped corn the snappy burnt kernels did n't taste as bad as other brands br br this white popcorn tasted great with canola oil and even better when popped with coconut oil . 
this is the best white popcorn yet ! i 've tried the others sold on amazon there 's no comparison it was fluffy flavorful almost every kernel popped ! \( how often can you say that \? \) i 've already ordered more so i wo n't run out . 
good product almost all the popcorn pops up fluffy and snow white with our air popper , great snack with few calories taste great ! . 
if you enjoy a rich flavored cheddar cheese with a bite of horseradish , i would give this a try it was a instant party favorite when i brought this and crackers to friends house i would recommend this to anyone ! . 
love these soy nuts , especially the garlic and onion blend ! ! ! ! perfect for taking to a party or just snacking on while on the go been happy with every product from truson . 
the onion garlic soy nuts are my favorite they add a great hit of flavor to salads , and the added bonus is they 're good for you . 
i like the onion garlic flavor it really tastes good , very fresh and it is much healthier for you than other non organic soy nuts i like to add them to my salads instead of croutons . 
this is a very good gingerbread mix lots of flavor and easy to make it 's probably a bit overpriced but i was having alot of difficulty finding any gingerbread mix in the grocery store i use this mix to make gingerbread muffins with diced pears and dried cranberries i 'll purchase another six boxes when i run out of mix a good buy and good product . 
this packaging is awesome my main annoyance with regular jolly ranchers is that if you keep them in your pocket , they will melt and stick to the wrapper and eventually stick to your pocket not delicious this packaging completely fixes all that it 's the size of a pack of gum , and the candies do n't stick to anything ! br br clearly not the healthiest thing to eat , but if you 're on your feet all day long and often find yourself without a meal for 8 hours , these could be a convenient quick fix for when you start to feel all weird and wobbly and hypoglycemic br br totally no nutrition in these , but they are great for when you need a bit of glucose boost . 
these crackers are made from whole flax seeds so they are n't like your usual chip or cracker some people i 've shared them with do n't care for them at all , but some loved them i am on a raw food diet , and i use them as chips to eat with guacamole or or other raw dips raw meals sometimes take a lot of advance preparation and when you 're really hungry , these will fill you up fast ! just make sure you drink a lot of water and do n't eat too many at once i personally liked all the flavors the onion was just a bit strong for some , but i thought it was ok will definitely be buying again . 
love them ! ! i love knowing how much better this is for me than potato chips or typical crackers i am focused on eating nutrient dense food and am avoiding putting into my mouth non food items for entertainment only i love crunchy foods and this is great the flavors are all good except do n't like the sweet maple and cinn flavor as much br my family doesnt like them because they are not evolved yet , immature taste buds is all i can say at this point start your babies off early and you wo n't have to erase habits of eating non food for fun . 
i got these because i'm on a low carb , high fat diet and was wanting something high fiber that also packed a bunch of omega 3s these fit the bill pretty perfectly ! the flavors are n't all winners , but they 're all really strongly flavored which is fantastic for a crispy snack i like the flavors of these more than i like the flavors of potato chips , honestly br br they do n't strike me as slimy when you chew them , but your mileage may vary i mean , yeah , the texture is a bit odd \( imagine chewing a bunch of sesame seeds , similar kind of texture \) and they do get stuck in your teeth , but hey that 's flax seeds for you if you do n't like \( or tolerate \) the texture of flaxseeds , there 's nothing these crackers can really do for you br br the flavors my favorite is the mexican flavor , hands down a close second is the hemp \( rosemary ! nom nom ! \) and the cinnamon maple \( higher carb , but only barely really cinnamony \) i'm not really a fan of the onion garlic and italian i love garlic , but it 's just too much the original flavor is icky , it just tastes like soy sauce and flax meh i like soy sauce , but it 's not really an ideal flavor for crackers ! if you like japanese rice crackers you might like that flavor br br i think the cinnamon maple would probably be a fantastic flavor to spread nut butters on \( chocolate almond butter , almond butter , peanut butter , whatever \) . 
these crackers are incredible healthy and tasty you ca n't go wrong the italian and mexican harvest are my favorites the cinnamon are great for breakfast with yogurt buying the six pack allowed me to taste all to see which ones i would order again . 
i loved the foods alive garlic and onion flavor flax crackers when i finished my entire order of 6 bags , i decided to try the mustard flavor since i love all mustards on almost everything well i just finished my first bag of it last night and it 's ok organic , crisp fresh for sure but does n't compare to the strong powerful garlic onion flavor maybe the mustard is too mild on my palate but i just thought the flavor was too bland for my taste br br if you like a mild mustard always wanted to try organic flax crackers made with pure ingredients no fillers or chemicals , then this flavor is for you and i would recommend that you try it . 
nuttzo makes great nut butters their chocolate version is like nutella should be less sugar and other crap delicious and super nutritious . 
i love this tea and have no complaints ! ! ! i just want to comment on how the tea is packaged it comes loose in little plastic baggies so if you want to use it you have to have some sort of filter we have an iced tea maker and used a cone coffee filter which works just fine i did buy a 2 inch tea ball but the loose tea just falls right through it so i guess i did n't buy the right thing . 
some people mentioned the loose tea is difficult to filter br br use a french press made for coffee is a good option dilute concentrate to desire strength my favorite flavors are mango and passion fruit . 
my whole family is addicted to this tea we make it in our mr coffee iced tea maker it 's fabulous ! . 
we are big fans of the passion fruit tea but wanted to try something different i like all of the flavors but the blackberry is my fave for a change of pace , still got to have the passion fruit as the go to tea though everyone raves about how good this stuff is i ca n't make enough . 
many food establishments serve chna mista tea and i love br the flavor , i was happy to be able to purchase it on amazon br i make it my iced tea maker it 's so easy and has a great br taste with less caffeine try it you will love it too . 
decent every day loose leaf tea the china mist brand is good , the only downside is some of the tea is pulverized too fine , so there is sediment in the tea i recommend letting the tea settle before serving china mist is not extremely high quality , just a nice every day tea that tastes fine the sample pack gives you a chance to try some variety , and it lasts a while . 
this is a dual review , as it has to be the first part covers the delicious , needs nothing else china mist iced tea varieties included in this box each of 24 packets contains four ounces of the world 's choicest tea leaves , with stellar flavorings mixed in \( dried , crushed mango dried , crushed passion fruit dried , crushed raspberry pure , strong tea \) br br my first experience with it was at a restaurant where our daughter works she said , order the iced tea , dad , you wo n't need to put any sugar or lemon or anything into it \( always looking out for my diabetes \) it was fantastic , nearly the highlight of my meal , which itself was outstanding i asked the manager if he could share the tea secret well , we use the industry 's best , china mist ! everybody says it 's the best they 've had ! indeed br br the flavor was , if you 'll pardon me , complex and could be rated as you would a nice wine action , hints of this or that , a new rush at the end of your taste cycle it made me think what i 'd been missing this tasted like what the british must drink , the full bodied teas they enjoy apparently americans add as much extra water to our tea as we do to our coffee \( what the french hear when we order a java over there i 'll have coffee , with a cup of water on top \) br br the second part of the review concerns our hamilton beach iced tea machine we add the recommend water and ice cubes , and the brewing cycle indeed does take only 10 minutes the tea is already ice cold it may be the difference between a home level heat limit , or maybe the fact that the water is not pressured over the tea as much as it might be in a commercial machine , or maybe the commercial machines are much better insulated around the steeping container our hamilton beach unit made a weaker tea than i would have liked we 'll reduce the amount of water from now on and see what that does in fairness , the bamilton beach iced tea make was 22 49 commercial models are 600 or more , but they brew their stronger teas in only 8 \( versus 10 \) minutes a wildly expensive two minutes . 
i purchased this product mainly to try out the different flavors of tea when i find the flavor i like i will probably buy a case of it china mist tea taste great as for those who have problems with tea leaves getting in the tea do n't worry i went to the local supermarket \( heb in texas \) and found empty tea bags in a box for about 5 they work great fill with tea and fold top and staple . 
i use this syrup in tea , coffee and over cut up fruit and ice cream i buy unflavored creamer and add this to it much cheaper alternative to pre flavored coffee creamer . 
i love cheese in general i 've had lots of european cheeses , and this one is outstanding br br the texture is a bit hard , not creamy as french cheeses and the flavor is full and rich great to serve with some bread and of course , some wine it is great with salads as well , you wo n't need any dressing since the cheese is enough a good flavor enhancer by itself br br i have shared it with many guests and they all love it it 's not salty like cheddar and smoked cheeses , it 's more of a refined goat milky flavor br br it 's always a success ! . 
so i had this cheese on my mind ever since trying it at a restaurant in sf this was one of those things that i though when im bored and want to burn money on shipping i would order is it worth it \? yes if you are a cheese fan , goes great with any wine \) not so much if you are being curious . 
your guess is as good as mine regarding what festival means when they claim that their canned shiitake slices are fresh pack on a separate subject unlike mw polar brand of canned sliced shiitake , festival brand does not add sesame oil , which would make the mushrooms taste better but at the expense of adding unwanted calories from the bad polyunsaturated fatty acid , linoleic acid \( omega 6 \) , which is the only kind of polyunsaturated fat contained in sesame oil . 
i tried this at first as a gluten free alternative to cream of mushroom soup turns out its really good ! modified my mils swedish meatballs recipe using this sauce as the base also served it with shitakes over rice very versatile and tasty ! and its great that the ingredients do n't read like an industrial compound . 
i seem to have entered my green tea wave br after years of only black tea , then white , oolong and green tea , i have discovered the loose fruit flavored green tea mixes sold by teavana , which are delightful teavana makes tea drinking a pleasure with all the available accoutrements and utensils br br this green tea mix is flavored with apple pieces , hibiscus flowers , rosehip peels , blackberries , and blackberry flavoring , raspberries , plum pieces , cactus blossoms and spearmint and is called blackberry mojito br br fruitmixes are nothing new in the tea world , but teavana 's product is most fresh in the vacuum sealed pouches and has a wonderfully delicious fruity fragrance however as an infusion , i found its slight astringent tartness somewhat objectionable , which most likely stems from the rosehips peel perhaps other people prefer this if compared to the lipton fruit flavored green and white tea bags , which are available now , and look like little pyramids , i have to say that i do prefer their taste , but as a potpourri blackberry mojito is the winner . 
i made the 10 bean soup with a few modifications i added carrots , onions , celery , and potatoes however , i did not have to adjust the seasoning this is not a bland soup excellent ! i also gave women 's bean soups , dips , and salsas to my extended family for christmas everyone loved the gift it simplified my shopping , and i felt like i was helping those who really need the help . 
last night they predicted an ice storm and i was going to have the day off for mlk , so i knew that this was the day to make soup this one is excellent ! my only addition to the recipe was a ham bone and about a cup of rice it made a great , satisfying supper pat . 
i did not purchase this but received it as a christmas gift it was wonderful ! my husband actually made the soup he followed the directions , added some ham and it was soup ! he did say that the beans seemed to get done quicker that he thought he would not presoak them as suggested it 's a great gift that not only gives to the recipient but helps women in need as well i would highly recommend it and will be purchasing some myself ! . 
if there is one good thing about a cold winter 's day it is hot soup the women 's bean project provided me with one of the best and it is good for me too how often can we do something that is good for us and so enjoyable at the same time \? br i have told all of my friends about it and i hope they will , in turn , spread the word so that the women of the bean project are kept busy and prosper . 
this soup has fantastic flavor i did not add the canned tomatoes but i did add all the extra vegetables in the my fridge . 
this coffee tastes pretty good , and i like the fact that it 's organic \( coffee has one of he highest rates of pesticides \) however , each time i use subscribe save , unfortunately , the price seems to get raised substantially a few weeks later , which is why i had to cancel my subscription to this . 
hooray for an all natural sweetner ! say goodbye to sugar and chemical based sweetners and get your hands on this stevia ! . 
my father in law bought some for me to try love it ! very sweet no aftertaste wonderful all natural sweetener my new choice , replacing all those other artificial packets i used to use . 
i bought this vinegar along with 2 others for my father for christmas i wish they could have all been shipped together , but they went separately good vinegar though . 
my wife had some white balsamic from a store in boston and loved it so , i figured i 'd get her some for xmas but i could n't get to boston ! this product and seller gave me a good alternative it is a fantastic product and she loves it we use it with lemon or other infused olive oils on salad or what have you nice ! . 
excellent product exactly what they said it would be superior chamomile from what i have ordered before from other companies excellent value for the price . 
i am not a coffee purist but i am addicted i 've dabbled in the flavorings coffee wannabe 's , and this is by far my favorite i usually put 1 teaspoonful of instant coffee with three regular spoonfuls of vanilla caramel latte , just so i have an extra afternoon shot of energy extra bonus when you pour the hot water over the mixture , it hisses purrs \) . 
though it 's hardly real coffee , my wife loves this stuff she says it 's like having hot caramel ice cream in a cup amazon 's 4 pk price is much better than store price if it can be found in a store . 
nice and smooth hopefully , gf or maxwell will not discontinue this flavor like they have my other two they losing my business ! . 
love this flavor ! i make mine with vanilla soy milk and 1 milk very nice ! almost like a dessert ! . 
this is so soothing , smooth , rich ! love this as my afternoon treat ! gf does have a history of discontinuing great favors , i hope this one sticks around \( kahlua , white chocolate to name a couple ! \) . 
we have a little shih tzu who absolutely loves cesar softies dog treats we have tried different flavors , but she seems to enjoy the grilled chicken flavor the most they are soft enough to break in half , and that is more than enough to satisfy a little dog 's yearning for a reward . 
i have so much fun watching my puppies asking for this chicken treats they go crazy when i show them the blue package these treats are small , easy to eat and does not have a bad smell i recommend it , your puppies will be happy . 
i used this treat as training reward and my dog loves it easy to break into smaller pieces will buy again . 
my westie like the picture on the package loves these treats ! they are the perfect size for a treat or reward and even look cute we call them br puppy paws treats ! good texture no mess ! smell not attractive to humans but good to a dog ! . 
the price is very good compared to any retail outlet available to me came in a simple plastic bag , which i plopped in the freezer we can pull out a bag , and have fresh treats for our little guy who so richly deserves and loves them . 
my dogs love the cesar 's softies get best price from this site the dog 's are a bit picky about their treats and this one is great ! thanks . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b003diiz9o cesar softies grilled chicken flavor dog treat , 6 7 ounce bags \( pack of 6 \) a br my two little dachshund boys are giving these treats 5 stars br after their evening walk they head straight for the pantry and impatiently wait for me to open the door so that they may have their treats \( 2 each \) as a reward for being good . 
i have a coton de tulear i know what is that \? \? \? they're from madagascar quite beautiful , very spoiled \( of course \) very finicky he just loves these treats . 
this is the best dog food their is because everything is very digestible and when the dog does digest it all digested because they use all the nutrition from it so it is healther and the best out their far as i'm think . 
i 've used natures logic dog food for about a year the difference in my dogs is impressive their coats are like silk what a wonderful product ! . 
this brand of coffee is excellent you can really taste the flavors unlike many store bought flavored coffees i have tried i like the individual packets as they stay fresh longer and i just use what i need out of the packet so it lasts a long time i would highly recommend this coffee it 's worth the price ! ! ! . 
highly recommend this brand of coffee for the beginner and seasoned coffee drinker i dont know how they do it , but these pre packaged sacks can actually make 2 pots of 8 cup coffee the flavor is slightly bold , but smooth as ever i actually dont even like to use cream or sugar with this flavor you can taste the flavors of butter , rum , coconut right in the cup smells incredible as its brewing however , i personally use a coffee press and the flavor comes through even stronger ! ! again , highly recommended , no cons , you will definitely enjoy this over the 6 tourist coffee plus this saves you money try it try it try it ! ! ! br br p s i also highly recommend the almond amaretto , caramel kiss , and butter pecan enjoy ! . 
i hate flavored coffee , unless it is flavored with dark rum ! this coffee is awesome i got a variety pack of these potful packs and there were ony 3 of 20 that i liked this is the only one i reordered . 
if you like flavored coffee this is one you must try br rich taste but not strong br smells wonderful so good you will want to stay home and sip on it all day . 
jamacian me crazy is sooo good my husband who normally adds cream to disguise the bitterness drinks it without cream let my mom and cousin try it and they too love it ! definitely worth trying . 
this is the best marinade to inject in a fried turkey ever made ! you do n't have to add anything of your own \( maybe a little olive oil , but that 's all \) plus there is a shaker mix you can buy to sprinkle on the top of the turkey , but this marinade can be injected to make a tender , juicy fried turkey we loved it ! . 
if you have tried pumpkin seeds in the past chances are they have been heavily salted , seasoned and deprived of most nutritional value or had the taste and consistency of styrofoam fortunately , neither description applies to these they are indeed raw but removed from the hull for easy eating no added salt or other nuisance chemicals just delicious and nutritious snack mix with raisins and or sunflower seeds for a healthy snack rich in zinc other vital nutrition or use with breads , cereals and flavor for your favorite recipe . 
red mill 's pumkin seeds are simply the best ! other seeds or pepitas do n't come even close red mill 's seeds are crunchy and very tasty they are product of the u s , not china like most pepitas well worth the price ! . 
usually , healthy food is hard to swallow not these , fresh , crunchy , delicious pumpkin seeds i switched from potato chips and my wife tells me they are good for the prostate what do i know \? i'm taking her word for it . 
i grind these seeds up in a coffee grinder give them to my dogs they are a natural dewormer , add good fiber to their diet we 've sauteed them with some seasonings in a pan the kids will eat them , they taste similar to sunflower seeds you can also put them in the oven , or eat them raw the seeds are good quality , you do have to either freeze or refrigerate them to keep them fresh pretty expensive though . 
i only ever had pumpkin seeds before in cereal , in small amounts these are great just add them to bob 's granola , or yogurt even just plain by the handful , they are great . 
love bob 's redmill the best of the best pay a little more than the other guys but all american and employee owned ! ! ! pumpking seeds are high on the calorie chart so just a teaspoon at a time ! ! . 
these raw shelled pumpkin seed kernels actually have a slight pumpkin flavor which i assume indicates that they are fresh , unlike the store bought \( h e b \) raw kernels that were pretty bland they are also extremely nutritious high in iron , protein and fiber actually , pumpkin seed kernels have four times the iron and about 25 more protein than beef per 100 gram the price produces somewhat of a sticker shock , though , at over seven bucks per pound however , considering all of the fiber and nutrients , i believe they are well worth the price bob 's red mill has the nutrition facts displayed on his web site i highly recommend these pumpkin kernels because they taste great and , as you can from the facts below , are at the top of the nutrition chart br br usda nutrition content , seeds , pumpkin and squash seed kernels , dried br protein 33 97 br fiber , total dietary 15 79 br folate , food 18 13 br niacin 41 56 br vitamin b 6 10 21 br riboflavin 13 91 br thiamin 27 30 br vitamin c , total ascorbic acid 2 53 br vitamin a , rae 0 16 br vitamin e \( alpha tocopherol \) 18 17 br calcium , ca 5 75 br iron , fe 147 00 br phosphorus , p 212 59 br magnesium , mg 169 14 br copper , cu 0 19 br selenium , se 20 89 br zinc , zn 83 09 . 
these are not only one of the few pumpkin seeds grown in the usa they are great and fresh every time . 
this product is great tasting ! i was eating the pepitas at half the price due to not finding usa made pumpkin seeds the pepitas tasted bitter and were much larger i hope red mill continues to make their pumpkin seeds in the usa it 's worth the higher price for excellent quality and supporting local usa companies . 
because these are more expensive than some of the other brands i decided to order since they had great reviews and are a product of the usa i'm sure glad i did because these are delicious ! my whole family likes them straight out of the package we 've not yet taken the time to roast them . 
i sprinkle these on oat groats or just grab a handful and munch i transferred the contents of the package to a ziplock once i opened it and keep it in the freezer to ensure freshness . 
i had never tried bob 's red mill pumpkin seeds although i have used and been very happy with many of their other products i was looking for pumpkin seeds from pumpkins grown in the usa most of the organic seeds are from china the bob 's red mill seeds are from pumpkins grown in oregon br br i took the plunge and ordered 4 bags of these seeds , and they arrived in less than 48 hours br four sealed bags were also in a sealed bob 's red mill box and then packaged in a larger amazon box br br i just opened one bag of the seeds to try them they are way better than what i was getting at my local whole food store in bulk these seeds are chewy as they should be and not hard or stale with any off taste br these have a slight pumpkin taste , which they should have this variety of seed is rounder and flatter than some of the other pumpkin seed varieties i 've had , which i like \( no pointy ends to stab me as i'm munching them down \) br all in all , a great buy ! br br seeds 5 stars br grown in the usa 5 stars br total 10 stars ! . 
i liked the idea theses were from the u s a and loved the taste and quality i will buy more they are a great source of iron and i take them with me everywhere i go for a healthy bit to eat . 
lot of pumpkin seeds in this box of 4 packages fresh quality product 24 oz packages made this box a good investment easy to share with friends family ! far less expensive than buying these seeds at the grocery store ! . 
if you are a man this is the best you can do for your health , eat pumpkin seeds bob 's red mill has the best grown here in the good old usa the others are from china , enough said . 
i like these so well that i signed up for the subscription rate where they mail you automatically every month or so your choice br br we eat a lot of these , but i 've not roasted them yet most nuts taste better roasted , so why not \? looking forward to it . 
these came fresh , and sprout well for me i am very pleased with them they make a tasty and nutritious addition to our salads as usual , amazon delivery and postage was great with the super saving shipping option . 
they are raw so i put them on a cookie shhet no spray and dry roast them at 350 for 7 to 9 min then they have a roasted flavor without any of the oils cankeep in freezer to keep fresh very yummy great on salads . 
just excellent product ! ! ! ! i would buy it again it is better than i was expecting i do not have any complain about it . 
these pumpkin seeds are the quality i have grown to expect from bob 's products this is the best price i have been able to find on pumpkin seeds and enjoy them on a daily basis , especially in the morning with oatmeal . 
researched a lot on internet before buying these great price , great taste completly happy with my purchase although a bit expensive , but a quality product does comes with a price tag ! ! ! ! . 
i have only eaten the raw and they were as expected i 'll be roasting some up this weekend but i'm always happy with bob 's products a company . 
recently , i was gifted the ice cream of the month club by a very good friend i was somewhat confused thinking how the heck can their be an ice cream of the month club \? but , with having given and received numerous of the month clubs and having all great experiences in the past , i was curious to see what they had put together here needless to say , what a fantastic surprise ! the 4 boutique frozen deserts arrived packaged in dry ice and were completely frozen my girlfriend and i were pretty enthusiastic to dive in and try them all , but took a step back to read the companies review on each of the vendors and brands we decided that we would begin with the berto 's gelato roasted banana true italian artisan gelato after a single bite , my girlfriend declared that it might be the best gelato she has ever had , and proceeded to eat most of it while we watched tv the best description she give as she devoured the gelato was saying it was like having velvet wrapping around your body the additional flavors included in our shipment were gilles sherbet swirl , cedar crest elephant tracks ice cream , and oberweis cookie dough classic each of the selections were very delicious and from companies i have never heard of i highly recommend this club to any person looking to give or get an array of tasty desserts that you 'll want to find more of once you 're done ! . 
i use this in all my recipes calling for brown sugar as per the instructions on the package , use one half the amount called for in the recipe if the recipe states one cup of brown sugar , you use only one half cup of splenda brown sugar blend i am not a diabetic but i do have many family members who are and this is a great substitute for real brown sugar , even though it does contain part splenda and part real brown sugar . 
the only difference i can see between using this blend and using brown sugar is that you do n't get the usual sugar rush when you eat the result cookies and pies made with this splenda blend which does contain some sugar taste the exactly the same as they did before great stuff ! and it 's gluten free too . 
there is nothing better than a huge baked sweet potato with \( real \) butter and splenda brown sugar totally covering the butter and sweet potato , makes me want to fix one right now ! . 
i love this product now that the holidaze are falling apon us and i am a diabetic it 's nice to be able to have treats that i can eat , and not feel deprived this is a great brown sugar sub it is the best i have tasted it works like regular brn sugar so if your on a diet or diabetic like me your prayers have been answered . 
i use this on my oatmeal every morning i ca n't tell the difference between this and brown sugar no 'after taste' . 
first , i just found out it calls for half the amount of splenda blend compared to regular brown sugar by reading these reviews in spite of that , i still give it an excellent score ! br br i 've always used brown sugars of all kinds in my coffee when at the store a few weeks ago i was looking for a lower calorie sweetener for my coffee and happened to buy this splenda brown sugar blend i 've been using it in my coffee since and love it the only difference i could tell was it was so much sweeter than my usual coffee that when i got close to the bottom of the cup i would pour more coffee into it to stretch the sweetness now i know why it 's twice as sweet as regular brown sugar ! br br just ordered the 4 pack and this should tide me over for a while adding it to teas and coffees delicious ! it 's also cheaper on amazon xoxox . 
splenda contains real sugar , you have to pay attention to the word 'blend' in the title yes , diabetics can eat it because it 's only half \( or less \) the blood sugar elevating agent of the same volume of 'real' sugar it 's also why it tastes like 'real' sugar and can be cooked unlike some sugar sustitutes a lot of non sucrose based sweetners are destroyed by heat br br what i 've found with this splenda brown sugar is , even though it 's bulked up so that it 's supposed to be equivalent in volume to all sucrose , it 's really very , very sweet so i do not substitute it 1 1 for sugar i use much less than i would real sugar . 
it has been mentioned that you only use half the splenda blend than regular brown sugar , which is very cool the only problem i have run into is when i need brown sugar for volume \( making a crust for my rhubarb crunch \) , half does not work , so i end up using regular brown sugar \( rather than double splenda \) other than that it works like a charm and you can hardly taste the difference ! . 
this is a most excellent sugar substitute for those who watch their sugar intake br br but ! ! ! \( and this is important because one does tend to follow recipes to a fault \) you must use half as much as the recipe calls for , which btw , does not work as well as you 'd hope it 's just not nearly as sweet cup for cup br br i make that up using extra splenda white because i use brown sugar for it 's sweetness as well as the molasses flavor this is why i will only give it four stars because they could make it cup for cup by doing what i do and adding more splenda white so a baker could follow their recipe and not give it a second thought heaven knows they 're charging enough for it br br i'm sure you know this brown sugar is unrefined or molasses sugar you can make your own brown sugar by adding 1 tablespoon unsulfured molasses to 1 cup cane sugar and mixing it with a fork it comes out nice and fluffy and you can control how much caramel flavor it has \( and how much extra sugar too \) br br splenda brown sugar blend as it is , is a very coarsely granulated splenda , a little coarser than splenda white so the texture is better than what you might mix up on your own so for convenience , you ca n't beat splenda brown sugar blend the splenda brand is superior \( in my opinion \) to the store brands that are popping up but ymmv , and your store might have a really good version br br still and this accounts for a very good four stars you can always count on splenda , for texture , for flavor and consistency when you bake , that counts for a lot in my book . 
this taste just like brown sugar with less sugar br i use this for everything , that requires sugar \( baking , est \) i use less of this than is required , like if it says use 1 2 cup i use 1 3 of splenda brown sugar . 
my morning breakfast br br a six ounce container of fage 2 plain greek yogurt , mixed with a sliced banana and 3 or 4 sliced strawberries add a teaspoon of splenda brown sugar blend , and it 's nicely sweetened , and a healthy way for me to start my day i started this breakfast routine over a year ago , and have n't grown tired of it it was suggested at a weight watchers meeting as a very low points breakfast it has easily become my standard for breakfast so much so that i will bring a bag of splenda with me on vacations , in case i have trouble finding it at the store \( i also openly admit that perhaps i'm too hung up on this routine but it 's so satisfying in the morning that i do n't care \) br br i have n't personally ever cooked with this brown sugar blend , but as a topping on my yogurt or a baked sweet potato , it 's been great ! . 
this mix of splenda and sugar works pretty well for me a teaspoon of it is enough for a large cup of coffee , and it tastes like a real brown sugar . 
i just love this even on my diet i can have hot yummy oameal it is satisfing without that rich brown sugar flavor its just not the same taste love it ! ! ! . 
i 've been using this to cook with for over a year never had a problem with it love it ! . 
love this substitute for brown sugar always stays moist and no one can tell that i am using it , instead of regular brown sugar . 
i have used this in my baking with the regular splenda and it works great ! always trying to cut calories with out loosing flavor works great in my muffins with just a touch of sugar . 
baking for my husband \( with type 2 diabetes \) just go easier br i can adapt regular receipes i use only half the amount of sugar called for a bam ! they turn out great the 4 pack is a great buy too ! . 
if you are looking to cut out some cal and want a great taste then go with this i keep getting it sent to me every 6 months love it ! ! . 
i purchased this item to bake some low carb cookies for a diabetic friend this works well for that , however , i did find that there is another brown sugar alternative that is calorie free both options worked well in the cookies . 
i am still undecided if this is a sugar free option i know it is mixed with real brown sugar and therefore it has the drawbacks for people who tries to stir clear away from sugar as far as the taste it is just like brown sugar and it works very good in all baking endeavors , which was the principal reason for the purchase it does have sugar but i have not been able to determine how and if is detrimental to those who prefer not to partake in using sugar i mostly use ezsweet that has 0 everything but needed to use some kind of sugar so i bought this perhaps it deserves a higher rating and also there is the chance it might deserve 3 stars instead of 4 still , it is a better option than most items out there in the free world so that is why i allocated 4 stars hope this helps and wish all who read this the most wonderful and invigorating holidays , starting with thanksgiving all the way to the new year 4 stars for splenda brown sugar blend 16 ounce packages \( pack of 4 \) , which by the way it ended being in quantity much more than i had bargained for but what can you do \? unless in the future amazon would allow to split orders such as this with other deserving amazon customers imagine that ! . 
who ever is making french 's potato sticks , keep it up ! they are the best ! french 's should have keep them in their line mike .

my 10 month old son has been a fan of yummy spoonfuls from his first bite the garden medley flavor is a new favorite the puree is thick and almost creamy , perfect for a baby who likes his food to have texture he 's always happy when i bring a cup of this to his tray ! . 
if every seller was like jr mushrooms the world would be a much better place they wont stop until there customer is completly satisfied i ordered some winter black truffles from them and got my package lightning fast but came to find out that it wasnt what i ordered i called jr and they said they sent better quality black truffles that cost more for the same price and this story doesnt end they even sent a jar of the original truffles i ordered just so i can taste the diffrence for free ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! name another seller that would do that . 
finally a company that cares about it 's reputation and products ! i ordered these truffles and recieved them securely packaged and protected to ensure they arrived safely and as quickly as possible i am even planning a special dinner with friends entirely based around the truffles i ordered as i was so please with them br br i also saw the other products this company carries the attention to detail and the information provided on each and every product is outstanding just like their quality \( i e saffron \) i have found my gourmet source from now on ! . 
true story i surfed online looking for difficult and expensive to find gourmet ingredients when i came across this listing every review raved about the excellent service provided by jr mushrooms i phoned them to ask a question about refrigeration vs shelf storage and got a voice mail i left a message and five minutes later the man himself personally called and gave me friendly and professional answers to my questions i ordered these truffles and several other items the next morning there was a little personal e mail from jr thanking me for the order and by noon the order had arrived , although i chose the cheapest shipping this is the best customer service i have ever experienced with on line shopping thanks ! . 
first package was lost in the mail , but jr shipped a backup at no charge with 24 hour shipment ! ! ! ! . 
not only are the truffles excellent , but the package arrived in record speed with standard shipping chosen we are very pleased with our truffles and with our experience with this company we will be ordering from them again ! . 
i gave this item as a gift and the recipient has not yet made the dish for which i gave it to her \( a foie gras dish \) but i must say this price for a french truffle is amazing i suspect most of us do not have the palates to appreciate the 300 truffles good for those of you who do but for the rest of us , this is a good choice br linda morse . 
this review is mostly about the seller they are great ! the product arrived within 2 days , with standard shipping br br i have never had black truffles before they have a very earthy , smoky flavor that really emerges when lightly sauteed in butter they are an expensive , pleasant , treat . 
this is our second time using your black winter truffles they are truly delicious we throw them in with pasta and truffle oil to have the world 's best dish reminds of our stay in tuscany this is a quality product and we plan on buying again in the near future . 
recieved the truffles in one day shipping the customer service is over the top i opened the jar and enjoyed the aroma , i will shop with them again . 
tying to find a tea that did n't have that bitter taste was difficult and the cost of teas is not cheap anymore i was trying many of the healing teas , but they had stevia added to them and i could not get past the taste of that this tea is not bitter , and has a very nice smooth flavor i have had it both hot and cold i do feel that i am energized after drinking it , but it is not a jittery hyper feeling it is more of an awake and alert feeling mentally and refreshed energized physical feeling some reviewers state it has a sweet taste to it but i do not get that while i do not often add my 1 2 packet of sugar in the raw to it perhaps that is what they mean that you do not have to add sugar to it i have replaced my second cup of coffee in the morning with this tea and i even have another cup throughout the day instead of coffee excellent taste and an all around great product . 
as a long time yerba mate and coffee drinker , runa 's traditional guayusa has switched me over permanently ! the super smooth and sweet flavor to this tea gives it the same drinkability of any other stimulant based drink , but with the lasting power and complexity as any high end tea br br drink up ! . 
i was introduced to runa guayusa about 6 months ago and i have been drinking it pretty consistently since then it is a great alternative to coffee , which tends to make me nervous the taste is mild and almost a little sweet , also it does n't get bitter like green tea or yerba mate when steeped for too long br br also runa 's business model makes me feel good about drinking this tea , they are a certified b corp and they do great work with the farmers in the amazon br br i highly recommend you try it ! . 
i usually do n't drink tea because it does n't have the caffeine kick i'm looking for , but guayusa tea has almost as much caffeine as a cup of coffee and unlike coffee , it does n't need to be drowned in cream and sugar to taste good and does n't have any of the other unpleasant side effects i usually add about half a spoonful of sugar per cup , which is enough to pleasantly complement the natural flavor now if only starbucks would start carrying guayusa . 
as a tea junkie , runa 's traditional guayusa offers a simple , agreeable taste that 's not like any other tea i 've had i used to swear by matcha green tea , but runa is a superior alternative in that it 's super cheap , more energizing , much easier to swallow , and offers just as many health benefits br br also , if you look into it , runa 's doing some great things on the side of social entrepreneurship and rainforest conservation i highly suggest reading into it it 'll make you love the product even more . 
you 'd be surprised how much runa tea can help you in your daily life thirsty or not , hot or cold , this tea can help you in many ways as a college student studying to be an entrepreneur , i ca n't just take prescribed drugs all the time to keep my attention span up instead , i turn to caffeine all day every day runa tea has been one of the few products that have really caused me to feel refreshed as if i was just hydrated after a run , as well as feeling focused as if i were ready to write a 10 page paper from scratch i do n't know what it is , but it just makes you feel good in every way personally , i love the cold tea but as a consumer everyone needs to find their niche , as i am a huge hot tea drinker and chose the cold version either way , same thing you need to try it and then try and contradict our 5 star opinions ! \) . 
clean taste and clean energy br br packaging is attractive , simple , and elegant as well br br sustainable sourcing and organic cert round out the whole package br br overall nice product . 
as much of a tea fanatic as i consider myself , i 'd never heard of guayasa before running into the runa brand now that i have , i could see myself buying it over and over again ! it has a full bodied flavor without the bitter aftertaste of some black teas it 's earthy without being heavy handed or overpowering , completely unique from any other tea i 've tasted you wo n't find tea like this anywhere else and though the product speaks for itself , the business model of this brand does n't hurt runa buys guayusa directly from local farmers in ecuador at fair trade prices try it ! it 's worth every cent \) . 
i watched a youtube video on guayusa tea , and heard very good things about it there and on the amazon reviews as welll so i thought i would give it a try money well spent ! this tea is smooth and easy to drink , and is absolutely delicious with sugar and honey br another awesome thing about this tea is the dreams you get my mother has n't had a lucid dream in years , and i offered this tea to her one day , and that night she had three vivid lucid dreams ! she was so thrilled she bought two more boxes of the runa guayusa tea i am so satisfied with this product , and would definitely recommend to anyone who needs some steady energy , focus , and vivid dreams \) . 
i saw an ad for runa guayusa in mother jones magazine and because it is a fair trade item and described as less bitter than tea , i thought i 'd give it a try br br it is exactly as advertised no bitterness , just a little hint of sweetness , and a nice gentle flavor very easy drinking , and it does give a kick of caffeine energy i have been a diet pepsi diet coke drinker for 25 years because i like their tastes and the caffeine \( never could do coffee and tea is too bitter \) , but i have recently converted to being a bicycle commuter for work and needed to ditch the heavy soda drinks this guayusa is perfect as tea bags , it is obviously lighter than hauling around sodas , and it has more caffeine too better for me , too and no bitterness like tea or coffee and i'm supporting fair trade small farmers in ecuador instead of giant soda companies the packaging is 100 recycled , 70 post consumer br br this guayusa is as good as advertised , i like drinking it , and i ca n't think of any negatives 5 stars i'm glad i found this product , it is worth the price . 
talk about a versatile new product drink it hot on a winter morning , drink it iced on a summer afternoon , mix it with your favorite coctail , add it to a marinade , combine it with your your best herbs i love it all ! it 's smooth and almost silky texture and lack of tannins make it great for anything how has it taken so long to make it to the states ! . 
love the snack wanted to buy a bunch p shipping at amazon is more than the price of the snack try ordering a dozen and then look at the shipping price p every link i 've tried to this snack takes you back to amazon 's exhorbitant shipping rates p another reason to buy your books at overstock com too back they do n't carry food as well . 
wow this chocolate raspberry flavored coffee is the absolute best we have ever had and i can honestly say we have tried quite a few in our time and of course the price ca n't be beat unless you find someone who wants to sell you some that fell off the back of some delivery truck . 
i was surprised how much raspberry flavor the coffee has the coffee has a nice aroma and a suddal chocolate flavor i will get this flavor again . 
we really enjoy this coffee we recommend to store it in an airtight container after opening to maintain it 's full flavor we enjoy it as an evening coffee . 
this coffee is my favorite i usually do n't like the taste of coffee and ca n't tell the difference between brands , but this stuff tastes different and good my only complaint is that amazon raised the price recently from 29 70 to 34 42 i still bought it again at the higher price but if it goes any higher i probably wo n't . 
nice small nutritious biscuit nice pocket size resealable pouch is a plus as well will order more in the future . 
my cairn , jack , and westie , mojo , both love the lamb what we refer to as doggie cookie bones br they 're finally accepting the need to go out onto our five scrub acres to relieve themselves br with help of the pro plan biscuits with real lamb as a reward we use the small ones as jack br tends to overeat and mojo weighs less than 20 lbs this one item added to their daily menu has br made a huge difference in our household , reducing the mama 's not happy time to about zilch ! . 
i am so happy to have found a wonderful decaf tea for myself and guests this tea is nice and full flavored and has a very smooth finish i usually use the k cup twice on xl setting and the tea remains true and delicious the price is the best i have found anywhere . 
twinings english breakfast decaffeinated tea was exactly what i was looking for i loved the english breakfast tea but needed to find a decaf version the taste is great , the price is right , and i'm sold ! . 
great tasting tea in fact , much better then the bags of same i'm an decaf irish breakfast tea drinker but ca n't find that in k cups english breakfast in k cups tastes great ! ! . 
i have been drinking twining 's tea for years it used to be made in england but now they have a plant in north carolina for the american trade the tea is excellent i drink the decaf for health reasons and find that it is as tasty as the regular tea . 
i just purchased a kurig and this was one of the first k cups i bought i still use it but if it was decaf would be better than id rate it five starts . 
please do n't tell me this is going to be a seasonal find only ! ! ! i made the pink lemonade cake with the pink lemonade frosting for july 4th and it was such a big hit ! ! ! the blend of lemon , sweet , and pink are just right ! ! ! when i went back to get more mixes they had been relegated to the seasonal clearance section and i could only find 2 cake mixes and no more frosting \( it 's definitely a year round keeper i'm thinking granddaughter birthday parties , ballet recital parties , pinkalicious parties ! ! ! . 
i made the pink lemonade cake mix and used this frosting to frost it for mother 's day , and it was a huge success my mother , who does n't normally like cake really enjoyed this i thought it had just the right blend of tangy and sweet i hope this flavor sticks around , because it was really good ! . 
pink lemonade is one of my all time favorite drinks , so when i saw pilsbury had this beautifully pink pink lemonade frosting , i had to get it i paired it with their pink lemonade cake mix br br i think i died and went to pink lemonade heaven ! actual lemon flavoring gives this just a hint of tartness , while the sweetness drives you mad ! the gorgeous pink color says easter and spring ! br br perfect for dessert for the family , or the ladies tea br br i highly recommend this yummy frosting ! try it with the cake mix too ! . 
this is my favorite of all the choices of coffee for the new vue i do n't like strong tasting coffee i prefer dunkin donuts over starbucks until they come out with a dunkin donuts vue pack , this light roast is perfect for me . 
i have recently purchased the vue by kurig and i must say my initial impressions are very positive the new design provides a better cup of coffee having used green mountain nantucket breakfast blend before , i was presented with a very good cup of coffee it is actually stronger and better flavored than the original the brewing system must contribute to the difference if you like medium roast coffee as your morning wake me up than you should give this a try assuming you are going to use it in the new vue machine . 
i was very happy with the way this turned out it is very similar to traditional american beers \( bud coors \) but with an extra kick the flavor is very smooth , has a creamy head and ends with a slight bitternes this is a great beer to start with for new brewers and veterans alike if you are to anxious to wait for it to age , you can drink it after 2 weeks it will taste good , but get better with age make sure to put it in the fridge after it carbonates lager ages and taste best when in colder conditions . 
i brewed this kit first as it was the one that came with the brewery kit i followed the instructions exactly note if you do n't follow the instructions exactly you are opening up opportunity for problems i brewed for about 7 days i then bottled and let condition for 2 weeks at room temperature i then put the beer in the fridge i tried two bottles the next day the taste was ok , but it was very flat i then put more bottles in the fridge and let them sit for 2 weeks i tried one of these after the two weeks and it was great the carbonation was perfect and the taste improved even more definitely give the beer time to condition you will be glad you did . 
makes a nice lager that 's quite a bit heavier than the domestic lager beers i do n't plan on making any more , but has more to do with my love of dark ales than the quality flavor of this kit . 
i have been brewing this beer off and on for the past five years along with many others when it comes time to pour a glass it has never let me down even without using lagering methods it always develops into a a tasty drink . 
i got my husband a brew kit from coopers for his birthday the lager is the only beer he 's tried to brew , but he says it 's very easy and it tastes good it tastes best if you only let it ferment in the bottles for a week we 're definitely going to try other flavors . 
this is a good brew for the time and expense involved that being said , the longer you ferment and bottle condition , the better it will be i thought i had drank all of my batch when i discovered two additional bottles tucked away they were the best and they had sat for a good three months give it time if you follow the included directions you will get closer to six gallons vs the five in the amazon description additionally , the included directions state to use sugar obviously dme lme will work better , but you can still use plain old old sugar \( i 've used brown sugar and avoided any cider like finish \) if you order the full kit it comes with carbonation drops and a dextrose adjunct save yourself the money , get this kit , use sugar and bottle condition forever . 
i love using the cooper 's os lager can as a base for making various pale ales since it has bittering only , i can add different hops dme 's to it to make light to dark amber ales it 's easy to get consistent results with especially when re hydrating the yeast in 1 5c luke warm water to which 2tsp of dextrose has been added br it 's a good product for experimenting for the beginner experienced home brewer alike . 
these almond rice pops are a very healthy snack 17 cubes are 2 points in weight watchers and you feel like you are cheating they are oven baked , all natural and extremely tasty biggest problem is they are very hard to find almond pops with blueberry used to be sold at costco but no longer ca n't find those anywhere br i order often and in volume because my friends all like them too so i share my orders with them br expensive snack but well worth it . 
i bought a bag of the blueberry version of this snack at costco recently \( well not just one bag i went back and got four ! \) they are really really good not too sweet , gluten free , vegan and all natural ingredients at costco they were 6 99 i was googling it to see if i could find the other flavors listed on the back of the package cranberry and pineapple mango and this listing came up 18 25 is the current price listed i mean this product is good , but not that good i wonder if the price listed is a typo . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b00769zsvo 180 snacks almond pops with cranberries 17 oz value bag a br br i have celiac disease , and while shopping i picked up a bag of these snacks because they are gluten free so yummy , i had to have more and found them on amazon and ordered 3 bags i will be saving them for our trip south for the winter they are absolutely the best ! ! . 
i just discovered this addiction at tjmaxx ! ! ! i paid 7 99 \( kind of pricy \) but when i opened the bag and tasted them for the first time omg ! i could'nt believe it ! i can not put the bag down ! you ca n't eat just one i have to stop myself from eating so many i have googled the website and they are down for construction until october 1st my only hope is when they open up the site that they will sell these at a reasonable price and not be outrageously priced like ebay and others ! i like them but i'm not paying over 7 99 for them ! anywho give these little snacks a try ! they taste great and most of all healthy ! . 
these are delicious and addictive they are touted as healthy but i did n't see anything particularly healthy in the nutritional list but they are n't unhealthy , which is good enough for me the best thing about them \? costco is carrying them now ca n't vouch for next month . 
yeah these are very tastely and healthy , but the price here is ridculously high at 18 not sure i understand why since amazon is just referring you to 180snacks com , where you ca n't find the almond pops , but you can buy them ! so , if you search almond pops with blueberries at google it will take you to the 180 site and you can add them to your cart ! i e mailed them and they said their site is under contruction i'm about to try and order from them directly hope it works out since it 's hard to find tasty and healthy snacks . 
ssssssssssssssh do n't tell anybody ! ! ! more for me ! these are the best snacks ever and i am excited about them because my daughter plays softball and we have snack rotation guess what they will be getting \? also for the kids little league , healthy , crunchy and satisfying , just what the little guys need ! . 
the 180 snacks almond pops with blueberries are the best i love the bite sized pieces the flavor is fantastic very crunchy , not too sweet , nutty and fruit flavored at the same time the perfect healty snack .

i 've tried every one of this line of products and i have to say , i'm blown away by just how satisfying they all are not too much , not too little , every recipe falls within my personal taste parameters , as well as everyone i know who has tried 'em , for that matter the ratio of carbs to protein , the low sodium , etc , makes this a very attractive snack to me because i'm diabetic it 's why i'm compelled to write a review it 's really hard satisfying some of the cravings a diabetic gets we love our carbs , but it 's so hard finding low carb snacks that give the same satisfaction as , say , a loaf of bread , or crunchy sweets , etc the grandpa po line literally saves my a because too often i cheat on stuff that drives up my blood glucose , and that is very bad so , a handful of this stuff literally is a benefit to my health fellow diabetics , take note ! .

grandpa po 's originals scored big on our party 's fun factor these half baked nuggets of organic popcorn blended with dry roasted soybeans were a surprise hit with both kids and adults our young nibblers approached this snack with a quizzical , what is this \? caution but once tasted , the bowl was quickly emptied and our partygoers were eager for a refill grandpa po 's come in slightly unsalted and slightly spicy . 
the crunchy popcorn snack with soybeans that grandpa po has created makes us want to meet the ol' man and give him a pat on the back ! while we are questioning the slogan on the package better than food there is , however , no questioning this recipe for a great tasting , healthy snack the mix of organic popcorn and organic soybeans makes a great alternative snack food and we love the re sealable pouch with just the right proportion of soybeans to popcorn this product comes from a company that celebrates food hooray ! . 
outstanding ! delicious ! what on earth are these things \? simple they 're a yummy mix of nuggets made from organic popcorn and organic dry roasted soybeans they 're so delicious your head may actually explode once you taste them slightly unsalted , but majorly addictive , these crunchy snacks are good for you . 
i love snacks and grandpa po 's originals are a great snack to satisfy a hunger craving they are crunchy and have great flavor it 's hard to stop eating the whole bag in one sitting ! . 
we have always loved this snack each time we seem to enjoy it a little bit more my daughter is a huge fan of it and is so glad that we can grab it and go it 's a nutritious snack that satisfies all the tastebuds some of us have even tried the slightly spicy brand having both flavors allows us to satisfy those who like spicy and those who do n't with the same snack thus no arguments between the kids ! . 
if anything can actually be better than food , this snack certainly fits the bill you gotta try them they 're tasty , crunchy and just plan corney like the bottom of the pot kernels we used to fight over as kids , these kernels fit the bill however , we no longer have to fight over them cause the bag is full of them ! great job in creating these things now excuse me as i nibble on some more . 
these are a great grab and go snack that satisfy i love pop corn but do n't eat it that much because my husband hates my breath while i am eating it at the movies , so i take grandpa po 's originals instead and he keeps hogging the bag ! i know soy beans are healthy for you and this is the only way i enjoy to eat them i love these ! ! ! .

been munching on these for now 10 or so years ca n't believe i did n't write a review earlier ! basically these are your healthier , organic alternative to regular popcorns you might be surprised by its much firmer texture \( than popcorn \) at first , but go through a couple , and if you 're like me , you 'll appreciate the quality crunch and just the right balance of sea salt ! i was hooked so fast , i was just chugging the ziplock bag into my mouth for a mouthful of tasty treat , and no , did n't need to reseal the pouch ! the spicy version is just as good it is n't that spicy \( it 's slightly spicy \) and highly addictive try both and you will not go back to those greasy popcorns ! yay for grandpa po 's ! . 
great for the munchies or when you just need something to snack on i love popcorn so this was just what the doctor ordered just perfect for me . 
this is a very good snack and good for you price was good shipping not bad , but good for distance . 
i tried this snack because it looked healthy , so i did n't expect it to be too great i was wrong it is very very good ! i 'll buy more when my supply runs low br john d . 
these are really good ! i find grandpa po 's originals to be filling and delicious , and since they 're technically whole grain , they are way better to have in the house than doritos . 
granda po 's are the perfect snack when you crave something crunchy and delicious they are also very healthy so you can enjoy them guilt free i love all the flavors my son begs me for them , so now he 's a fan too i even shipped them to my brother 's platoon in iraq everyone loved them ! . 
i bought some of this creates an awesome effect on decorated cakes and candies love it ! completely edible br br but wayyy overpriced on amazon usually amazon is cheaper than buying in stores but these are only 4 at any craft store so 15 is severely overpriced . 
it 's awesome the dust gave my cake pops a great sparkle to it i used white and purple candy melts i would recommend this to anyone . 
my daughter loves painting this stuff on cake pops it add just a little color if painted on dry but the color is more vibrant if mixed with extract and painted on . 
we enljoy having loumidis greek coffee every day iam an expert making the coffee when my mother in law was alive she wanted to have greek coffee every day at four in the afternoon , so kept the trantition . 
not as tasty as some of the others out there , but for the bulk , i 'd pay again . 
i highly recommend these candies , they are that best ! they are really good for the price they come individually wraped which is nice , the colors are direrent from picture , they are bright colors which i love , because i can give it to girls and boys ! they are also oriental traiding brand and in their website , they have really good reviews for this item just look on their website an look for this item 5 923 , i can not be more happy , the kids loves them ! . 
i pass around favorable endorsements very seldom but this is one of those occasions br br i'm almost 69 and this bacon would be as almost identical to the bacon i ate if it were a bit saltier and had the rind left on br br if you want the old time southern bacon without all the salt and the rind , this is it br br i 'll admit i do salt the bacon just a tad before i fry it br br this is good stuff if you appreciate great bacon . 
cant make corn tortillas or tamales without masa harina these folks ship their product in sturdy boxes great for making a long journey overseas . 
it 's cornflour , period but , ground as only masa is to make a good corn tortilla it has great flavor tortillas can be a real pain in the fanny to make too many people worry about how it doesnt look like a commercial tortilla but , i 'll bet you that crooked as it is it will leave tia rosa in the dust the hardest part is getting the mix right after that all you need is a rolling pin and two pieces of wax paper make a few and you will get the hang br br you really do n't need a tortilla press what you really need is practice . 
corn flour is n't treated with lime treating corn flour with lime gives it a fairly distinct bitter aftertaste and a more dense construction chocolate chip cookies made with masa harina , which tastes like the tortillas it 's meant for \? little bitter bricks with chocolate chips eek br br \( i wish it were corn flour as of this writing , none of the major mills in the americas that means north and south make gluten free corn flour not even bob 's red mill is , anymore , bless them for having the integrity to say so although i hear you can order it from someplace in canada \) br br this is where we cut to the clueless texas roadrunner face br br this is masa harina , sorry guys . 
these make a good and very filling lunch with a little bit of lemon juice squeezed over them . 
with cayenne pepper , it is about the quantity you get for a price and i believe i got a very very good bargain does n't happen often , but it is so nice when it does br br thanks . 
yes , there are higher hu products but this is exactly what is advertised i use this to make a tincture to reduce high blood pressure comment if you want more info . 
good product and fast delivery with follow up br 90k is very hot and i'm drinking it 3 time a day \) br will buy again . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b0001m0z3o cayenne pepper ground , 90 , 000 hu 1 lbs a br this is good cayenne pepper i found some 150 , 000 organic once in a specialty store that you had to be really careful with this 90 , 000 will light you up and it tastes good if you want some hot cayenne pepper get this . 
good stuff , take it easy if your not used to it it improves taste of food , better breathing , better circulation , helps with arthritis a bit . 
this is the best cayenne that i have used the taste and aroma is a bit more mellow than other 90 , 000 hu cayenne powder from the past , but definetly delivers the kick ! ! ! . 
i actually bought this to use as a squirrel repellant \( which it worked fantastically \) safe to treat your gardens with however i found myself using this to cook more than anything else tastes great when sprinkled over wings . 
the pepper is great ! ! plan on using it to keep squirrels off of suet , but will try it for cooking also price was great one note though , product is pictured in a jar and although it says packaging may be different , it should say sold in pouches somewhere i thought i was getting a jar . 
i have no idea what a heat unit is , and i kind of doubt frontier does either , but hey the proof is in the spicy and this works one teaspoon makes four quarts of chili nice and toasty , and two tsp make it killer hot my local outpost co op food store carries frontier brand spices , and outpost does n't sell crap , so i'm satisfied they operate responsibly . 
much better than the stuff you get from the grocery store and so much cheaper i 'll be buying more when i run out i use it on food and i put it in gel caps to take as a supplement . 
i recommend this product timliness of the delivery i especially prefere cayenne ground with 90 , 000 heat units this is a good one br i highly recommend br stanley e ford . 
please correct my original review as i made an error br br my experience was completely satisfactory excellant product and service ! br br sorry about the error br br s g lilly . 
this seller was great ! ! ! recieved my order in about 4 days ! ! ! the cayenne is great ! ! ! nice flavor and hot just the way i like it ! ! ! will be back for more after the 2lbs are gone ! ! ! thanks for a great product at a good price ! ! ! . 
lana 's snowflake black tea with coconut and almond has now become my favorite tea first the smoothness is unbeatable i found it a bit smoother than the hanley vanilla cormoro ! secondly , the aroma changes from the time you smell it in the bag and then brew , it is a great experience when you taste it you have a wonderful surprise of sweetness and comfort sort of a nutty , caramel with vanilla notes , it is the perfect dessert tea my husband lost 18 lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream ! now when you present it to friends , let them taste it first if they go by the intense aroma in the bag , it is so fresh some have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor , but it is not it is the amazing freshness they are not used to we served this at our wedding vow renewal and it beat out hanleys vanilla cormoro and paris too this tea has filled a gap i have had in my collection , i have searched for a flavor like this over 3 years ! ! br lana please keep on creating this tea , i am definitely coming back for more br and thank you for tremendous and fast service btw , i am sipping this as i write yum ! br smiles , grace in vt . 
the written description of this tea was good enough to get me to put it on my wish list this xmas my wife prefers the sweeter fruitier teas , such as republic of tea 's kiwi pear , and i generally go for traditional blacks , prince of wales , oolongs , etc but this tea is perfect for both of us ! i always liked good vanilla teas , and some coconut teas always blew me away as well our pals at steep tea still make some of the best teas in around , so we were pretty game to try this lana 's tea it always feels good to try out teas by the 'small guys' br br anyway , there was this unbelievably great aroma to this tea that we could n't pin down until one of our pals pointed out this smells like bailey 's ! bingo need i go on \? . 
i completely agree w grace brunelle 's comments this the perfect dessert tea i have given up sugar , but love coconut , and this is the perfect replacement the smell in the bag is intoxicating , but it mellows to a soft vanilla almond coconut smooth sweetness when brewed i have many excellent teas in my collection , but this beats many of them , especially if you are craving something sweet thank you lana , please keep making \( and quickly shipping \) this fantastic tea ! . 
one , one , wonderful from the beach boys smile album br this tea is that wonderful aroma and taste br try it and smile ! ! ! br br and it always ships on time ! ! ! . 
i absolutely love lana 's snowflake tea ! i received a sample when i ordered the finum permanet filter through amazon \( which , by the way , is the best filter i have ever used ! \) i fell in love with the snowflake tea and had to order some for myself it 's fantastic ! . 
i bought this at a shop because it sounded good \( i love coconut \) and it was awesome ! it 's become my favorite tea . 
this tea is my favorite , i 've never had any tea that could match it please consider making it in a decaf version so i can curl up and enjoy it in the evening also ! . 
this tea is very similar to paromi coconut almond i have bought at whole foods unfortunately , i do n't live near a whole foods ! this loose leaf tea is awesome ! i was first put off by what i considered to be higher than normal shipping charges , but the cost of the tea is so cheap when compared to buying it in tea bag form i will probably get 50 cups of tea out of this package the flavor is so unique i ca n't wait to try it this summer in a sun tea jar . 
recieved the tea very quickly with very helpful , detailed brewing instructions tea is absolutely delicious ! ! ! ! ! ! like dessert in a cup ! ! ! ! . 
my husband and i enjoy a really good cup of tea lana 's snowflake black tea sounded so interesting and the five star reviews made it simply irresistible i had to try it the delivery was very fast and it was nicely packaged when my husband saw we had new tea he had to open it the next thing i heard , wow , you have got to smell this the aroma is so wonderful , the sweet scent from the coconut and almond fills the air and the hints of vanilla are simply divine while the fresh aroma is intense the smooth taste is beyond compare , a great substitute to after dinner desserts its calming essence makes it great for a quiet evening at home be prepared to indulge your senses br br snowflake tea now has to be our favorite tea i plan to buy it as stocking stuffers for my friends and family lana , keep creating this tea , i plan to buy a lot more . 
the best soda crackers so tempting i 've reordered br br i will probably not order a third time though because of the high shipping cost nothing to do with my satisfaction with the product br i hope the company will consider using amazon prime br i savor each crunch , delicious br thanks . 
although dundee 's orange marmalade is stocked everywhere , their hard to find ginger preserve is truly incredible i have tried many other brands but this one is truly classic with the intense ginger flavor i love try it on a warm english muffin , crunchy fresh waffles or as a roast chicken glaze . 
this preserve is really delicious aromatic and not too sweet nor too piquant and it 's cut in just the right size pieces for spreading not too lumpy or too 'jammy ' br br i 've wasted so money on so many different preserves i eat a few teaspoon fulls , usually find them too sweet , then they sit in the 'frige until i finally throw them away this brand , i ate all of in just about 2 months which is really fast , for me it stayed in edible condition in the fridge up to the last spoonful br br amazon is listing four bottles , each containing 1 pound of preserve , so each bottle costs about 5 50 plus shipping . 
found these locally in chicago about 6 months ago amazon 's price is high but these are definitely the best i have ever tried my wife and i cook with it and just spread it on toast or crackers the white jar is also distinctive . 
for those who enjoy ginger , the dundee preserves taste great on crackers and bread the texture allows for easy spreading , but it is not runny it also stays fresh if stored in the refrigerator . 
on an english muffin , the day starts off best with the mild taste of ginger ! . 
always used the robertsons ginger , this production is almost as good , but the price is inflated for the size of the jar the product was packed well \( glass jars \) and arrived promptly . 
my nearby fresh and easy market \( an english company \) has a variety of english fruit spreads and i'm enjoying trying them out one of the latest is james keiller son dundee ginger preserve oh , my ! this stuff is just delicious i 've always liked ginger , but as a spread it 's just fantastic ! what a nice flavor for my breakfast toast ! i can hardly wait to try this out on other folks or i could give a jar here and there as gifts i'm sure they 'd be appreciated br br gary peterson . 
this spread is just right but costs only about six dollars locally br price with shipping here is ridiculous ! . 
great coffees i enjoyed the most when friends come over for coffee , it gives lot of fun to try out all the flovor . 
i picked this off the shelf without any research , and my husband , who 's pretty particular about his vodka \( and tequila , and rum , but that 's another story \) loved this i'm not a vodka drinker , but even i had to admit the first smell and taste were extremely pleasant and he said it tasted wonderful straight and excellent in mixed drink made by two guys from pennsylvania using a copper still definitely worth the price . 
our 3 year old son was diagnosed with being allergic to soy and peanuts this is the only sunflower butter that we have found that is free of both allergens and not processed on shared equipment this is the only product we buy now our son likes it on pb j , crackers , on celery and by the spoonful and with no sugars added much more healthy for him . 
this stuff is pure , natural , creamy goodness perfect for using in recipes and for eating straight out of the tub ! . 
since swanson 's sun butter only contains roasted sunflower seeds and no other ingredients , it is the only nut butter product we buy ! . 
this is a sun butter with absolutely fresh roasted sunflower seed taste i was pleasantly surprised from the first taste shipping is very reasonable also i trust swansons , but still i was astounded by how good this tastes ! . 
i originally ordered this product as an allergy free alternative to peanut butter i have many serious food allergies \( peanut , walnut , almond , dairy , gluten , corn , soy \) , and another popular brand of sunflower seed butter \( sunbutter \) is manufactured on equipment that also processes soy \( not just in a shared facility , but on shared equipment \) ! i am thrilled to say that this sunflower butter is not only smooth and creamy with a delicious taste , but it 's organic , has no added salt or sugar , and is free of other allergens give it a try , i bet you will love it ! . 
when a peanut butter addict like me says this is better , it is saying a lot br wonderfull flavor , very creamy texture , almost to creamy , more like a puree br not to oily or sweet , just right does n't stick to the roof of your mouth br organic makes it even better and healthier . 
no sugar or anything added to the product i have to add honey to it when i eat it and it tastes fine with honey br quality seems fine to me , it seems a bit oily compared to peanut butter , but it never gets hard like peanut butter does even keeping it in the fridge . 
although sun butter tastes like sunflower seeds and nothing like peanut butter , it still tastes great and has a smooth creamy texture the only drawback i noticed was that it 's a little runny compared to peanut butter . 
just received this butter yesterday and we are already using it to make sandwiches with jelly tastes great without having any salt or sugar added highly recommend ! . 
this organic sunflower butter is the only one i can find with the least additives my only alternative is to make my own and this saves time . 
i ordered this product because i wanted alternative to peanut butter and it is organic i actually prefer the creamy sunflower taste over peanut butter now definitely would buy again ! . 
this stuff is great ! ! ! ! ! i'm allergic to peanuts \( just happened over night \) and i miss having a pbj , so this is the next best thing to it \) truly , this butter is all that and then some . 
pure and organic no salt , no sugar , no poison \) what more can you ask for \? i keep mine in the fridge and it stays soft and easily spoonable i use it in my banana cacao smoothies and it tastes good warning not as good as peanut butter for this recipe , but it 's better for you so i can accept the difference in taste i admit , peanutbutter and chocholate is a better combo and change is never easy but what 's your health worth to you \? this is all im buying from now on . 
per the manufacturer , the product is organic and only made from sunflower seeds it tastes very natural and fresh i would highly recommend if you like the natural taste of sunflower seeds . 
i put 1 2 teabags of easy now in an entire teapot let it steep for 20 30 min and have some before bed no matter when i got to sleep , i always wake up 7 8 hours later , feeling good , and without having woken up in the middle of the night \( except maybe to use the restroom , but i always fall back asleep instantly \) its also great anytime during the day to just calm your nerves , it wo n't make you sleepy this is easily my favorite calming tea . 
these are perfect for portion control i like the stand up bag too , great for putting the candy in the fridge as opposed to the flat bags my husband and i are both trying to lost weight , and to be able to grab one of these 70 90 calorie chocolate packs from m m are great br i was also very pleased with how they were shipped you have to pay a little for 2 freezie packs , but that 's fine and then it came in a styrofoam box to keep the chocolate from melting br i 'll definitely order these from amazon again . 
one problem with fun sized bagged candies is that they are lots of small products in individual wrapping , that means that you have that many more changes of something getting squished or ruined i 've always wondered when they 're cheaper than in regular stores or warehouses , if the quality is a little lower br br in this case i handed out a lot of the candies and while everything was eaten , there were some major problems with both of my bags of peanut m ms almost all of them were crushed and there were peanuts with a little bit of m m stuck to them and then a lot of m m dust the snickers were not squished and the twix sticks were all intact , so not sure what happened br br that being said , these deals that amazon are fantastic and they pack them very well definitely worth it if you need to buy it in bulk just , with all bagged candies , be forewarned that all the pieces may not come in totally intact . 
when i ordered these 2 bags it was only 18 today it 's 37 so i paid 9 for a little more than 2 pounds bag with free s h via amazon prime membership br br it had more plain m m 's than any other candy but that could have just been my bags you may find differently all the bags were sealed and none of the candy was broken or crushed it is fresh and the expire or 'best if used' by date is july 2013 so long shelf life i also sent a couple of bags to my senior parents who love chocolate br br if you found this helpful please click on the 'yes' box thanx . 
i really like the fruity taste of this tea so much so that i can actually drink it without sugar if you like fruity teas , you should try this product . 
when i read the other review of this tea , i had to write this tea has a wonderful , balanced flavor that mixes the tartness of raspberry and the sweetness of peach to come up with a smooth blend i usually want a little honey in my tea , but this one does n't really need it makes a great iced tea , too ! . 
i am a fan of the bellini drink , white peach puree and prosecco \( a italian sparkling wine \) and i was not disappointed i mainly brew it for ice tea i disagree with some of reviewers in that not only do you taste the raspberries and peaches you can also taste the sparking wine this is my primary drink in the summer to give it a little kick i will sometimes add a peach liquor or peach flavored rum i recommend it highly . 
my husband and i absolutely love this gum that is actually good for you ! ! ! it keeps flavor for a long time ! ! ! ! . 
a bit pricy , but well worth it to avoid the garbage found in other gums made in usa and delicious . 
i love b fresh cinnamon gum ! it tastes great , it 's good for you and it temporarily freshens your breath now the flavor does n't last a long time but with 100 pieces you have plenty to chew on . 
i love this gum , but i gave it 4 stars because the flavor does not last long you 'll enjoy it though . 
great for when you 're pregnant or nursing no artificial anything including no aspartame yay ! the bubble gum is the best gum in the whole world love this gum . 
wow ! great price ! i 'll never buy these at the pet store again ! about 6 months ago we started giving our rat terriers greenies after my vet told me about them we could n't afford 400 each to have our dog 's teeth cleaned \( and there is just no way these dogs would let me brush their teeth \) so we tried these what a difference it made ! ! ! ! the tartar an plaque buildup on my 11 yr old girl is almost completely gone and my 6 yr old boy 's teeth look like i had them professionally cleaned the added bonus is greenies make their breath smell great and my dogs love the taste of them ! . 
greenies arrived promptly , are fresh with an expire date thirteen months from now great price to keep my dogs favorite treat on hand for many months to come yes , she chewes through them quickly but she loves them so much , i dont care this is the best price i 've ever seen on greenies so we stocked up ! . 
my 4 border collies expect one of these each night before bed i 've learned how important it is to create regular routines to keep these active wired dogs calm , and there 's no way i have time to brush their teeth each nite , even if they 'd let me but this can get very expensive when i found them here at this price , i ordered tons then went back and ordered more , figuring the price would increase to that on other sites it had increased a bit , but still a great price entirely pets delivered a bit late due to supply problems , but that was okay since i had just received enough to last a month ! . 
i 've been buying these at the grocery store every week for a year my husband and i eat wp 's soups every day for lunch i am so happy amazon can deliver to my doorstep . 
months ago i had my first butternut squash soup , hand made at a fancy restaurant i do not like canned soups but i saw this in our local grocers , and remembering the soup i had at the restaurant , i decided to try it it was delicious ! it is my favorite lunch go to now i have added shredded roasted turkey to make it heartier , but as for taste it is wonderful i order the case on amazon , which is cheaper than my local store i also tried their french onion soup which is really good i have avoided the others simply because in their best form , i do n't like chicken noodles and tomato soups , but for the 2 i do like and have tried , they really made something from canned soups , and i 'd recommend them . 
very good soup , light and creamy added curry gives just right spice to the taste love it ! highly recommend to try it , you wo n't put your spoon down until you ate it all . 
i have eaten in various restaurants operated by wolfgang puck and have always found the food to be delicious this soup is no exception the only problem is that it is exceedingly high in sodium , fat , cholesterol and calories in general per servings totals are 200 calories , total fat 11g , saturated fat 8g , cholesterol 30 mg , sodium 540 mg ! this sodium total is 22 of what you should get for the whole day ! by comparison , campbell 's chicken with rice soup has 70 calories , total fat 1 5g , saturated fat 5g , cholesterol 5 mg , sodium 820 mg almost double the sodium \( salt \) but much healthier in every other category the bottom line is , if you want healthy soup , make it yourself . 
this is , quite simply , the best mac 'n cheese on the market it is our go to meal for when we have n't gone to the grocery store and desperately need a dinner br br my tips br add the optional butter , you know you want to br personally i find that it needs just the smallest pinch of salt to bring out its flavors br some fresh ground pepper rounds it out br br if you like this stuff , i also highly recommend the annie 's snack mix \( i think also available on amazon \) i believe annie 's makes both products with their patented bunny cocaine \( tm \) the dangerous addiction i 've developed is totally worth it . 
this mac cheese is really creamy without tasting processed and it has the right amount of salt very good product overall . 
i have always been a fan of annie 's products , and since i'm overseas at the moment , i didn' have access to the products that 's where amazon comes in ! the price is very good almost the same as buying them in the store in the states and the product came in great shape and the expiration date is not soon either ! br as for the product itself , i think the sauce can use less salt , but other wise i love it ! natural ingredients and it takes less than 10 minutes for me to make it \) . 
i am a big fan of anything annie 's so it is no surprise i give these 5 stars there is simply no comparison between 'the chessiest' and the truly chessiest mac cheese which is annie 's i enjoy the white cheddar the most . 
annie 's has a great line of food , and this macaroni and cheese is great kids like it grown ups like it ! ! . 
our family really enjoys this shells and cheese i love the convenience of mac and cheese , but usually the flavor is horrible annie 's tastes great and is better for you ca n't beat that . 
to all those who complain of the taste you arent making it right br br i know because sometimes i put in a little too much milk or whatever but when you make this stuff right it really rules its also good to know that im not eating as many chemicals as other kinds of mac and cheese br br i find the family size serving better personally . 
very yummy ! my kids and i loved it ! cute story on the box too ! . 
no long , frightening lists of chemical additives , either nice to find something quick and easy that i do n't have to feel guilty giving my kids from time to time i have no problem paying a little bit of a premium for annie 's , it 's well worth it br br oh , and for anyone who is getting lumps , take the package directions at face value and mix the cheese separately , then add the pasta . 
my whole family really enjoys annie 's mac cheese ! the reason i gave it 4 stars was due to the high salt content common to all boxed dinners . 
all annie 's products are excellent beats the other name brands br br for flavor it 's organic with no additives good item to keep on hand for a quick lunch . 
i bought this and a grinder \( and a couple other varieties of course salts \) as a gift for my spouse at christmas i know he enjoys the visual appeal of the coarse ground salt and i was tired of buying the 2 99 use and toss grinders of salt at the grocery store br br as far as this salt goes , you should not use it in a grinder because it is too moist i did not know this until after i had purchased it i still use it as a finishing salt , but for the use i had in mind , grinding on food , it does not work . 
this has to be the best and easiest bread machine mix i 've come across incredibly simple directions and impossible to fail plus the loafs come out perfect everytime \( i 've had issues in the past with getting whole wheat flours to rise as well as white flours \) i 've purchased this collection several times and will continue to do so . 
i originally got this bread thru amazon but now buy it directly from the manufacturer so i can get free shipping when buying 75 worth \( that 's a lot of bread mixes \) it 's truly delicious , easy to make in my bread machine and there are a lot of different flavors the yeast does come in separate little packs in both the individual and the multi packs br it 's a little more expensive than the hodgson mill bread \( also very good available thru amazon \) , but a much greater variety . 
i could not be more pleased with the bread machine mixes they are delicious the service was outstanding . 
i first purchased this food at the pomona pet expo this year and as i do all my cooking for my animals i was looking for a natural grain free dry to add to their wet i learned that feeding your dogs the right food from an early age is key to keeping them healthy and with you for as long as possible br br this by far is one of the best natural foods i have purchased and my dogs just \( love \) it the holistic primitive is high in protein and very well tolerated by sensitive stomachs this food has never been recalled and is made in it 's own plant , unlike most major brands out there that are manufactured at the same plant and only under different names the price i find to be fare , as i have paid much higher for other holistic food which was not received well by my dogs br br i highly recommend earthborn natural food for anyone who really knows the importance of feeding your companions healthy food and for those who really love their pet 's . 
my main reason for purchasing this dog food was that i wanted a food made here in the u s , of natural ingredients and not made in a plant where chemicals are processed br recently i have lost 2 of my beloved small animals to a company who produces pet foods in the same plant as chemicals , pesticides , and other cleaning agents it is my belief that carelessness and greed led to contaminated small animal food that killed my 2 pets br br i have a 65lb german shepherd aussie mix with a leg injury , and joint problems she has always been very active full of energy for her age of 8 years old in the past i 've tried either making her food or searching out holistic foods that are made here in the u s with natural ingredients br br we started out with a small bag of this food at first to see if she would eat it immediately she loved it ! she had no stomach upset , even though her stomach is sensitive right away her coat started getting softer shinier there was n't as much problems with her joints and leg injury as before and i did notice even more energy in her ! br br now that i 've been feeding her this for a while her coat has continued to soften , looks shinier no more scratching ! she 's maintained her regular weight without gaining any her energy level is amplified and she 's showing very little discomfort in her joints with her leg injury what i love best is that she eats every last bite of this food when its feeding time , when before she would only pick at her food i 've fed her other brands of holistic , natural and organic foods and none of them were this much of a hit with her this food really has made a difference in her overall health , coat and energy levels none of the other foods made her coat this soft ! br br these are bite sized pieces of food that an older or smaller dog would be able to eat mine does n't like big chunks of food , she prefers the smaller bites so this one is perfect for her oh , and upon opening this bag the scent is like meat not bread or preservatives in other foods this food is n't greasy either like many of the others we 've tried in the past that leave stains on the floor if it drops and she misses a piece br br i 'd definitely recommend this food to everyone who has a small or large dog the differences you will notice right away in your dog will make you a believer in this food as well ! . 
earthborn is the best grain free dog food and it is reasonably priced this food is calorie dense and so good for your dogs . 
i have a great dane she is very food intolerant she cannot tolerate brown rice , beef , lamb , sweet potato nor large amounts of broccoli , spinach , peas , and not too much fiber i chose this dog food because it has 3 meat proteins chicken , turkey fish , no rice , and small amounts of vegetables and is low in fiber this dog food has worked extremely well for her she no longer has soft stools , her coat is much better , she does n't have itching problems and she likes it it is high calorie so she only gets 4 1 2 cups per day for her 140 lbs . 
my puppy loves the stuff his poo is proper consistency since switching , his coat is beautiful , and he treats the stuff like , well , a treat ca n't wait to try the other flavors with him br br the ingredients list is tough to beat for the price br br jim . 
i had to look for a new food for my 100 pound puppy br she has a sensitive stomach and sheds extensively when in that phase and as many of you know , it is hard to find good food br i have ordered 3 small bags of different food brands , this one was the first on the list to try br br after 2 days , the coat of my dog got better and softer too i would have not thought that it would work so fast br poop stayed solid \( i did n't have a problem with that on the previous food , but its important \) and it does n't have a nasty smell anymore , as with the previous food great again ! br she still sheds a little but the coat is getting much much nicer and i am confident that it is a matter of a few more days until it is in outstanding condition br br after 4 days , the shine of my dogs skin is definitely noticeable this food is high quality and it shows on your dog we also got rid of the nasty gas which is as well a great indicator of a good food i recommend this food over acana , orijen or other foods with high protein levels , as it is grain free ! ! ! \( very important \) br br as for the price , amazon is a fabulous website \( i do have prime \) , however i was able to get 2 bags for 39 94 bag with shipping included on another website ! and as i am typing this , i got additional on time 10 off so not even with prime i would be able to get to that price br br anyway , as far as the food goes , it is very very good just be careful with the high protein levels , not all dogs might do well with it get a small bag and see how it works and of course mix it in with current food if it does n't work \( lot of gas and loose stool after a week or more \) , try a different brand with less protein you might want to look at precise holistic , fromm gold or canidea alternatives very good foods but the protein is lower get small bags , try one , mix in little by little , if it does n't work , go back to the previous food and than start with the other bag br br in case of questions i will be happy to help br br update so after about two weeks of use , the coat is shinier as ever , its absolutely beautiful the last time i remember her coat being so shiny was when she was a puppy there is a little gas now and than , but nothing horrible \( and i do feed my dog at night , so her stomach works during the night \) , stool is solid and still no smell i also notice my dog shaking her head less because of ears , food can cause ear and eye infection , so that is satisfying too as for the shedding , it has almost stopped its 80 better ! ! ! br br this is definitely the best food we have tried in 18 months we have tried around 10 12 different brands that gives you an idea of how good it is also , it is ridiculously cheap , if you know , where to buy it this food , under 40 ! is without a doubt , the best food money can buy well , at least for us it is . 
this is the best dog food ! i have seven dogs , three over the age of 14 and they are as spry and energetic as dogs half their age we went grain free years ago after one of our dogs got cancer i began reading about excess carbohydrates and how bad they are for our dogs \( and us \) initially we used evo because it was great and it was the only grain free availble we were very happy with it until the price went through the roof ! we tried several different grain free food over the next year or so some the dogs just did n't like some aggravated my lhasa apso 's allergies a couple of my dogs are susceptible to yeast infections and the evo had curtailed that problem but it came back with other foods finally we tried earthborn 's grain free line and voila ! they love it ! the price is right , no allergies or infections everyone is healthy and happy ! this is the best food around and the price is right . 
since switching our golden retrieve from his regular dog food to grain free , his skin allergies are much lessened and this grain free dog food is great it smells good even to me and to see it available at amazon with the super saver free shipping is wonderful ! . 
when i first got my dog i started her out with innova she liked it at first and then would not eat it unless it was mixed with wet food i then changed her to taste of the wild , which \( pun intended \) she was wild about she loved breakfast and dinner now however , after one bag i took her off totw because the company that makes it has had recalls with other dog food brands they make though totw was never on the recall list i loved my dog too much to risk it i did n't have a lot of dog food options for my area and i was not about to buy her dog food from wal mart all of which contain the ingredient animal digest which i am keeping her from a friend suggested earthborn , which is what she feeds her dog , and was also sold in my area and just as much as she loved totw she loved earthborn \( probably more \) she was soon an oliver twist and was asking for more this food makes me happy with the good ingredients that are used and her coat shows it i love this product and so does my dog . 
i have to disagree with another reviewer i did not find this pb gritty at all i always but natural pb without any added sugar and also did not find this too sweet it has a nice , not overpowering , taste of maple great snack on rice cakes ! . 
this superb tasting drink was used at the turn of the century for medicinal purposes as it purportedly had calming , but hallucinogenic effects thought to have same effects as thc but was disproved in 1999 but still , it is a very popular drink if mixed properly which is dissolving sugar through an absinthe spoon and mixing with vodka aptly named tnt the drink was somewhat popularized by the character inspector frederick abberline , played by johnny depp in the movie from hell based upon jack the ripper . 
my vodka tonics have never been so refreshing i wish i would have ordered two cases now as my husband and i are going through far too much . 
i ordered this and several other plants from this seller br br i was quite suprised to find that the plant was much larger than i expected \( with a full six heads on it ! \) and well packed every plant i got in this shipment is thriving and happy it has been two weeks now and nothing has failed to thrive this is more than i can say about others that i have bought from ! br br i will be buying from this company again . 
i got this from my mother and love it ! named him harold and though i do n't have any flies to give him , he is growing well you have to be diligent and make sure your trim any heads that start to turn black , and not let the plant dry out , but is n't that much work i ca n't wait to get a bell jar for him and keep him in my windowsill . 
my venus fly trap arrived promptly and in great condition ! thanks for the great service ! amazon is forcing me to write more words against my will because they are fascists have a great day , everyone ! . 
healthy plant received on time no issues , just the way i like it \) . 
there was a little damage in shipment which might be expected , but it is growing and catching flies with a little help ! . 
my new friend arrived with quite a bit of damange and only 2 heads , one crushed , i was so upset , but i put the moss back into the pot snuggly around the base of the plant gave it bottled water and plenty of sun and now , i have 12 heads and a very strong plant ! he bounced back so well ! eats flys and is now bright red and green ! . 
it came in good shape altho the plant came a little twisted and two were dead but worth every penny and six head were still alive very happy . 
item arrived in less than a week packaging was great old newspaper to fill in black space , and the leaves of the plant were tucked inside of a clear plastic cup to keep them from getting crushed there was a disposable heat pack that was placed inside to raise the humidity br br all leaves were green and healthy , not many traps were closed it had two adult plant , one juvenile one i separated them to give them more room in a hanging pot because the three inch pot would n't have been long enough for their roots \( they like over 4 inches of room for their roots if it can be helped \) fast forward 6 months , my collections has grown , and these original venus fly traps have been propagating with secondary growth points they 're growing like weeds ! br br do n't forget , they like sun and distilled water but be careful when you first get them put them in partial shade for a few days to avoid sun burning . 
i received my plant it was in great condition ! ! ! i have a question the box says its supposta stay in box for terrium im a little confused how is it supposta catch flies if its in a box can anyone tell me the direction in a not so confusing way lol . 
this plant arrived packaged excellently it was very healthy and came with good instructions for growing we will enjoy raising these . 
i was very pleased with my venus fly trap when i received it it was in good shape and came very quickly we have been having a lot of fun feeding it bugs . 
i bought this as a gift for my sister and her family who live in arizona they were so excited when it came and it was small enough to not be a bother but big enough to be interesting and pretty they were pleased it came almost right away \( days ! \) and the package was in good shape . 
my plant arrived quickly and packaged very well almost too well cause i was so anxious to see it and it took a bit of time to unwrap it \) the first day it did n't want to eat because of the stress from shipping , but now it 's eating the bugs i give it everybody is so intriuged with it and we all love it ! ! . 
we love the little venus flytrap , br it 's healthy , hungry , and producing new shoots br it arrived quickly and in good condition br altogether a positive experience . 
fly traps were for a science fair experiment they arrived promptly and were in very good shape all approximately the same size important for the experiment . 
we live in the country so flies are very bothersome this plant is probably stuffed , its working overtime each mouth has about three flies , i would think that is too many to digest but hey its eating flies like its suppose to . 
the plant come early then expected and was in perfect condition so far the plant is doing okay , just ca n't understand why the traps are turning black after every feeding i try contacting the company , but no one was there to answer the phone either way they delivered the plant to my house without it being damaged or smashed i would recommend buying from this company again . 
i received this item today and while it is indeed a venus fly trap in a 3 pot , i was disappointed to find it is the kind of plant that comes in the clear plastic packaging that is available at a few department stores and garden centers in my area i specifically ordered a plant on the internet to avoid getting one of these br br i still give 4 stars because it did arrive in pretty good shape , and most of the plants like this in stores are not very healthy and , after all , i ordered a flytrap in a 3 pot and that 's what i got just know that if you have a local store with a garden center , they may have these plants already and you could save the shipping cost by buying one there if you can find one in decent shape . 
we love to feed ours i chase flies and insects around the house sometimes just to watch them eat i would recommend buying some type of planitarium for them they need a warm humid space only use distilled water not filtered ! these plants are very delicate when it comes to the water you give them i would even go so far as to buy a guide book do n't buy the happy plants it 's a good book for a kid but it 's not a guide on how to raise these plants these plants are a great conversation piece for house guests need i say more \? enjoy ! chazz . 
the plant arrived in great condition fully green and with about five or six heads in the clear box that can serve as a terrarium will give it our best shot on keeping it up and running ! this was in much better shape than the venus flytrap plants at our local big box do it yourself in their garden area . 
i am a college student and wanted to get a unique plant for my dorm in my eagerness to buy this plant , i accidentally sent this plant to my home address instead of my dorm despite this delay , my plant arrived about one week after i first ordered it \( had it been shipped correctly , it would have taken only four days \) in addition , the plant still arrived in good condition its growing very well br br a few things to note this plant is , as stated , in a 3 pot do n't expect a giant man eating plant my plant came with about seven heads and a flower stem , which will hopefully bloom soon the one thing that this plant does not come with his any sort of terrarium or other habitat for it , though the plant 's robustness makes up for it make sure to follow the special care instructions with it and the plant will grow fine it is definitely worth the cost and it makes a perfect pet plant . 
i opened the carton and the plant looked like someone put it in a shoe box and shook it all up i did n't think it would live br it did recover however and a heat generating pad was included so i give it 4 5 stars knocked one for loose packing br i would buy from this company again in hopes they get better at packing . 
wen the plant arrived it was kinda small but now it is starting to grow new traps and its getting bigger every day i have enjoyed feeding it bugs and i an very satisfied with the product . 
this review is based on 9greenbox taking care of their customers if you receive an item that you consider to be subpar they will make it right highly recommend this retailer . 
my son asked for this plant for his birthday and he is very happy with it it seems to be doing well thus far , hopefully it will continue to thrive it was packed well in the box and incurred no damage during shipping . 
i love white polenta but most of what i find in the u s is very coarse it still tastes great but the texture leaves a lot to be desired moretti polenta friulana bianco is amazing the creamiest and finest i have ever seen . 
whipped peanut butter is n't for everyone it 's basically just peanut butter whipped up so it has more air in it for some reason , however , i love it it spreads easier and seems to taste sweeter , lighter , and fluffier if you 're a peanut butter freak , definitely give this stuff a try . 
this is one of the few canned sauces without citric acid their canned ground tomatoes i use all the time for sauce , better than imported san marzano , and i am an italian american i know my sauce this can be found in some local supermarkets , here in ny it is in shoprite , bestyet , and in larger cans at sam 's club for under 4 for a huge 6 lb can ! in supermarkets , i bought it recently at 1 for a 15 oz can on sale , regularly priced under 2 for a 15 oz can look for it and try it nice and thick and tasty as it should be an additional bonus for me personally is that it contains no food allergens such as dairy , eggs , or nuts safe for my granddaughter who is allergic . 
a great sauce if you can find it locally my giant carries it for less than a couple of bucks a can the flavor is great , very good tomato taste with a good bit of tanginess not sweet at all but there is a hint of tomato sweetness i never thought i 'd find something this good in a can i bought one because it looked out of place on the store shelf so it had to be good i 've read reviews on a pizza making forum and most of the people grudgingly concede its a good sauce . 
do n't be put off by the cartoon label this is serious , excellent pizza sauce , the best i 've ever tasted out of a can my family has been eating it for years basically , there 's no need for us to make homemade sauce anymore but do n't just believe me google don pepino pizza sauce and read other people 's rave reviews br br we ca n't find it in our local grocery stores so we usually buy a case or two at a time the pop top cans are also a perfect size for a large pie or two br br the company 's other tomato products , sold under the name sclafani , are also highly recommended . 
there is no better sauce and i think it 's even better than most homemade sauces one can will make two large pizzas it 's seriously amazing unfortunately , it is hard to find but when i do find it i buy all the stock \) . 
i used to work in a specialty pet store , and cats were my specialty i was the expert on diet after spending much time researching various foods , reading labels , and talking to customers i 'll share what i learned , and explain why i recommend this food science diet is one of the worst foods for cats , and right down at the bottom you 'll also find purina , meow mix , eukanuba , and iams these have by products , fillers \( corn , soybean mill run , corn gluten , grits , or white rice \) br br many of the better foods like blue buffalo , artemis , wellness , instinct , orijen , california naturals , innova evo , merrick , and my personal favorite vet 's choice health extension are world 's apart in quality and most are cheaper than science diet pound for pound in many stores br br these are the ingredients for a typical science diet bag minus the vitamins minerals , just to give you an example br br ground whole grain corn , chicken by product meal , animal fat , dried beet pulp , soybean oil , dried egg product , flaxseed br br corn is a filler , and it 's the number one ingredient by products are things like beaks , feathers , etc they 're waste products the only decent ingredients are down the ingredient list , meaning that they exist in a smaller amount then the first ingredients now , let 's look at a bag of health extension that 's both cheaper and of higher quality br br chicken , chicken meal , brown rice , oats , dried egg product , chicken fat , flaxseed , menhaden fish meal , herring oil , sweet potato , cranberries , blueberries , tomato pomace , natural barley malt , apple cider vinegar , goji berry , garlic , astragalus , ginger , blue green algae 6 kinds of probiotics br br the potato is a nice binder and good for digestion the oils and flaxseed are good for the coat being rich in omegs 3 's the probiotics regulate digestion the eggs and chicken are good sources of protein you might not need some of the extra ingredients like goji berry for example , but they 're better than fillers and at the very least harmless to cats br br i recommend this food because my cats love it , it 's relatively cheap for a quality food , and the ingredients are top notch if you want better food , go with instinct \( which my cats love even better , especially the rabbit \) but be prepared to pay much more the absolute best would be to put your cats on a raw diet using pucks of meat prepared by various companies , or simply do it yourself if you 've researched how to prepare it , but this is an even more expensive route . 
i was looking all over for milk in a paint can and i found it ! thank you amazon the only down side is that it is the sweet milk from a goat 's teat once one gets over that it is by far the best powdered milk in a paint can that i ever ordered online . 
by god , is there anything this stuff ca n't do \? br recently when it snowed holy hell , i was out of rock salt br with which to ensafen the driveway with sure enough , meyeberg 's br powederized saviour came to the rescue with just a few sprinkles of this remarkable 'jesus in a can' , every last bit of that ice did n't just melt , but literally sublimated away , leaving bare , dry and actually kind of unnervingly warm , concrete beneath ! br however , it managed to turn snow into ice cream , also apparently induces water into wine by proximity alone ! br however , since this occoured , i have never been able to reproduce these breathtaking effects except for one br it makes a very rich quishe . 
i prefer this powdered milk to the condensed form that meyerberg sells the condensed has a more sour flavor to it one has to realize that goat 's milk is not cow 's milk in that it is richer or creamier in flavor so it does startle one until your palate get 's used to something which tastes different when it is warm , it honestly tastes about as close to what a milk product should taste cold it has a slight powdered milk processed flavor br br i actually made ice cream from this powdered milk and it turned out pretty good it is like ice milk as this is milk , but it was different and enjoyable but quite sweet br br the recipe was 1 quart milk \( 8 scoops of powdered milk made warm and allowed to chill \) br br 1 cup white sugar br br 1 tsp vanilla flavoring \( you can try other flavorings like banana \) br br 1 8 tsp salt br br my electric freezer will freeze this in 20 minutes br br i like the powdered for it 's ease and it keeps well i can make up a quart and it will keep 2 weeks , so it is on hand and not wasting or forcing someone who has limited use to drink a gallon of milk granted one is used to cow 's milk , but this is something one can get used to if they have allergies and i am glad it comes in a nice metal can with a plastic lid to reseal after you pop the top and a plastic measuring scoop to get it right br br one can will make 3 quarts of milk . 
i used meyenberg powdered goat milk with my first litter of pups five years ago , and was very pleased with it , so made sure to stock up before my second litter was born i supplement the mother 's food with it , and mix it with ground puppy food to make a puppy gruel to transition the pups to puppy food the pups and their mother seem to love it , and have suffered no digestive problems at all it dissolves quickly in warm water and is convenient and easy to store i recommend it as a nutritional supplement for nursing mothers and pups both . 
my almost two year old is allergic to cow 's milk , so we give him a mixture of goat 's milk and rice milk liquid goat 's milk is expensive , at least where i live , so we switched to the powdered form a few months ago i do n't drink milk , but my son seems to like it okay goat 's milk products have a distinct flavor that you either love or hate i love it in goat cheese and goat butter , but my wife hates it judge for yourself ! . 
this is the best stuff going for a child that is unable to drink formula or soy milk i used it for my son when he was a baby i started him on it when he was about 3 months old , because of allergies and his doctor said to leave him on the soy milk even though it was causing him much discomfort i could n't just let my son suffer and took it upon myself to put him on goats milk and ended up with a healthy kid and a doctor who was also a convert ! . 
my son is sensitive to cows milk protein and i am trying to keep him off of soy my milk was not enough for him , and i did not like the ingredients in baby formula \( all had soy and most have cows milk protein , not to mention 45 corn syrup solids \) my pediatrician recommended this powdered goats milk because they add folate \( not normally found in goats milk \) since i have been feeding my son this milk , he has been so happy and growing so much better ! have not had to add any vitamins supplements to it to make it a whole food , it is fine on its own although , i have been using organic brown rice cereal because he is getting close to being ready for solids love this milk ! \( always consult your doctor before changing your babies diet \) . 
our little baby girl battled colic and reflux for nearly 6 weeks she was unable to sleep because her little belly hurt she would be 90 asleep when she would arch her back ad then scream in pain baby , mommy , and daddy were all miserable after going through all the brands of formula \( including a href http www amazon com gp product b000arpke4 similac alimentum hypoallergenic formula , powder , case of 6 cans each 1 lb \( 454 g \) a \) the doctor finally put her on goat 's milk and prilosec i am not sure which was the bigger influence , but the quality of our lives is now significantly better br br the nice thing about the meyenberg goat milk is that is easy to prepare just like regular formula liquid goat 's milk must be kept in the refrigerator and must be warmed not too big of a deal except for those 3am feedings ! another nice thing about the meyenberg powdered milk is that folic acid is added remember that if you choose to give goat 's milk to your baby that you will need to give some supplemental vitamins our daughter seems to enjoy the taste and as a bonus it does not have the nasty smell of a href http www amazon com gp product b000arpke4 similac alimentum hypoallergenic formula , powder , case of 6 cans each 1 lb \( 454 g \) a br br final verdict so far great let 's hope it continues ! br br 5 stars . 
we have been using meyenberg 's powdered goat milk for several years we used to buy their milk in cartons at walmart and it was good the only problem was that we live so far from a walmart store that we would run out of goat 's milk between trips we decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons of course it stores easily and indefinitely and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk . 
my 14 month old daughter can not tolerate cows milk or soy while she was an infant , she had to drink nutramigen formula and would only drink maybe 4 oz at a time once she turned a year old , and i began giving her meyenberg goat 's milk , she began to guzzle it ! she loves it so much ! she now consistently drinks 8 12 ounces at a time ! br br i mix one can \( powdered \) at a time , which makes approx one gallon we go through about a gallon every 2 days ! br br this milk is such a blessing ! we highly recommend it ! amazon has the best price , too it 's so much more convenient and less expensive to purchase it on here and have it delivered to us rather than make countless \( and expensive \) trips to the health food store . 
my daughter is allergic to soy cow 's milk , but tolerated goat milk very well she has been drinking it since she was 12 months it 's nice having a powder so we can take it with us when we are on the go there is more information about the milk itself on the meyenberg website after looking over the website , i felt confident that goat milk would meet my daughter 's nutritional needs . 
my three year old daughter has been drinking this brand of goat milk for the last 2 years because she is dairy intolerant this is a great product easy to carry \( because it 's a powder \) and mix it when you need it and , this is an awesome price 10 00 less than i usually pay for three cans . 
this goat 's milk has been a godsend for our granddaughter who seemed to get sick on every formula we tried the goat milk with a little coconut oil and extra dha became a fantastic infant formula once she started using the goat milk , almost all of her issues resolved themselves her skin cleared up completely and her scalp did n't look all scaly and dry she looked like the perfect child we knew her to be ! she 's now 7 months and has been using it since she 's a month old she has been growing beautifully and perfectly on this powdered goat milk the powder is very convenient too twenty years ago my nephew used goat milk in place of cow 's milk and also did great ! his allergies also became a thing of the past all i can say is this is an excellent product ! . 
i tried the condensed version and thought it was horrible so was concerned that i would not like the powdered either before i tried the powdered i had some of the fresh from my grocery store and really liked it as it turns out , this is quite the same as the fresh and about 60 cheaper br br we are switching because both of my kids had ear infections galore and now sinus infections galore one was always constipated and still is to a certain extent and one is showing signs of hyperactivity , which some believe may be related to a food allergy \( such as cow 's milk \) so i figured better safe than sorry and am switching the whole family . 
my kids enjoy this goat milk product with their cereal and i use it for cooking as well although i have n't tried many goat milk products this one is easy since i make what i need therefore there is little waste it is also easy to pack and take when traveling overall , i recommend this product . 
my little girl \( 6 months \) ca n't stomach any formula even nutramigen , at 35 per can made her colicky and sick \( accompanied with the worst smelling spit up \) the expensive formulas smelled bad , and tasted worse , i hated giving them to her goats milk was recommended to me her doctor 's only objection was that it was low in folic acid and tended to dehydrate babies well , meyenberg powdered milk is fortified with folic acid , so dilute it with a little extra water and you 're in business ! i now have the happiest infant you 've ever seen enfamil can take that nasty chemical soup they call formula and shove it , i 'll never go back br br you can get the formula recipe at br br br there have been concerns about arsenic in rice syrup lately , so i have been using lyle 's golden syrup , and she likes it fine \( also it 's the best pancake syrup you 'll ever have \) i am going to try barley malt syrup next , it is chemically more similar to rice syrup . 
i get horrible gas , stomach pain and loose stools if i drink a glass of cow milk or eat in cereal i have tried lactase pills and special milk with no results br br i use this instead and have none of those symptoms measure into your mixing bowl , cup , pitcher , etc and slowly mix in hot water as soon as it 's paste , you can add cold water doing it this way prevents clumping br br i like it and add just a touch of sugar or other sweetner kids ca n't tell the difference between this and cow milk i use 1 tbs of unsulphured , blackstrap molasses per 16oz milk it turns the milk light brown \( think iced coffee \) but my family does n't mind we like the way it tastes and appreciate the extra iron , calcium and potassium from the molasses \( has to be unsulphured , blackstrap \) this type has only 11g carbs per tbsp i use slighty less powder than recommended \( 3 scoops for 16oz instead of the recommended 4 \) this helps to weaken the goat flavor . 
we bought this after reading about it on dr sear 's website our son has had no problems at all with the formula , we add brown rice syrup per our pediatricians recommendation \( to add calories \) our son was a preemie , and was ebf for the first 7 months until stress from work affected milk production our son took to the goats milk right away , we mixed the first couple bottles with breastmilk until we knew he had no digestive issues with it , then were able to give him goats milk by itself the goats milk smells and tastes better when warm than cold i grew up on goats milk myself , so the taste does n't bother me , but my husband is n't crazy about good thing our son loves it , because that 's what really counts ! it 's 1 3 the cost of convential \( cow 's milk based \) formula and is easier for tiny tummies to digest it 's a win win all around ! . 
my son recently had a stomach virus that gave him temporary lactose intolerance buying fresh goat 's milk in the dairy section is very expensive compared to organic cow 's milk , but most of the milk alternatives do n't have enough fat and too much sugar for growing toddlers this powdered goat 's milk was a great solution it is easy to mix with my formula pitcher , even using cold filtered water , and the taste is very good my son likes it as much as he did his regular milk this item is hard for me to find locally , so i was glad to see it on amazon through s s i plan on keeping this in my pantry from now on in case his intolerance comes back or i run short of regular milk . 
my baby has had digestive issues from birth at 12 months i put her on this product and immediately saw improvement it did n't take long for her to accept it either i found a recipe on the dr sears website for making goats milk formula for infants and would have tried it when she was younger tip this powder does n't dissolve in water as easily as regular formula make a days worth of milk ahead of time and use a wire wisk to mix it . 
i give this milk to my son we are experimenting with different milks br br the pros the boy seems to really enjoy his goat 's milk and does n't seem to know the difference between the kind we get in the refrigerated section of our grocery store and the powdered variety it 's nice for those emergencies when your local grocery runs out of those few quarts of goat 's milk it carries it was also good for traveling to grandma 's and not wanting to take a cooler to store the milk br br the cons it mixes very clumpy unless you use really warm water to mix it even then you have to stir , stir , stir to get the lumps out also , once you open it , it has a limited shelf life , must be because of all of the fat if your intent was to open it up and use every once in awhile until it runs out , this product is not for you . 
i have been so happy with this product ! my baby girl has always had a sensitive tummy , up late hours w pains and crying with nothing to sooth her i finally found this product , our natropath suggested it my daughter loves it and it really helped her tummy ! now , i wont giver her any other formula it organic and difficult to find at local stores in my area i found amazon to have the best price and its easy to have it delivered to the door id suggest this formula to anyone ! . 
we love the powdered goat milk taking the place of regular formula ! raw goat milk is one of the closest and most nurishing milk to give a baby other then breastmilk , and when we cant get raw milk we go with powdered ! it sits well in his belly and digest great ! he loves loves loves it ! ! ! i have used this milk for all 4 of my boys and it has proven to be the best formula ever ! ! ! ! would highly recommend to anyone for their baby unless of course you can get the fresh stuff ! ! lol . 
my daughter who is 8 months old is on this meyenberg goats milk from 6 months all i can say is she is an entirely different baby now br she was a colicky baby , severe eczema flares now and then \( inflammation and oozing most of the time \) doctors asked me to try different br hypoallergenic formulas which she refused to take just a table spoon in her regular formula i gave up hope that she would ever change her formula br in the process i was reading about goats milk and its various benefits i spoke to the dietitian gastro doc and her pediatrician but none of them agreed br that i should feed her the goats milk because it is not nutritionally good for the baby i was very upset because all i knew was my daughter has cow 's milk allergy br and she was been fed cows milk despite of the fact it was making her colicky , making her skin worse day by day and she has severe reflux problems i decided to try this br product and luckily i was able to find it in whole foods made one bottle and gave it to my daughter while she was asleep to my surprise she drank it all and she slept br good for straight two to three hours which never happened in the last 5 months though she did not liked the taste later and i had to give her with the ratio of one ounce br goats milk to five oz enfamil , now she is doing 5 oz of goats milk to one oz of enfamil what a dramatic change br no colic , beteer skin with no oozing or hyper inflammation \( i sometimes apply on her milder inflammation 0 5 cortisone \) she is still on pepcid for her reflux but she is doing br better where as her spitting is concerened alomost 0 spitting \( before she use to keep on puking now and then \) i look at her and thank god for making me decide on this product br as she is a happy baby now i can only imagine better for her what will she be like when completely on the goats milk i have to supplement her with the multi vitamins br i took her recently to her pediatrician , her gi their exact words \( her skin has never been this good before \) the dietitian is working on my daughter 's diet plan to make sure br she gets all the nutrients which are essential for a growing baby br i did not wanted to make the trips to the whole foods everytime and pay a higher price for this product when amazon is selling on a great price of 3 cans the shipping is free br and the package arrives right on time before i am out of the stock \( you need to order this product before a week so u never run out of it \) the packaging is good and the cans are not br damaged or dented br great product br excellent providers amazon . 
i like this milk powder my boys cannot drink cow milk and fresh goat milk can be hard to get this does not get all clumpy in the can like some powdered milks and is easy to mix up if you use warm water per the directions it has a nice taste , much better than canned and just as good as fresh it has been very useful for traveling as you can mix up a cup or two at a time as needed . 
we have been using this stuff for our baby for three years and she loves it . 
my kids do not like the goat milk straight , but are both intolerant to milk my solution is to add a little of the mixed goat milk to vanilla flavored soy milk why would i do this , you ask \? i read that dairy products are the best form of calcium you can get , dairy and broccoli enriched products , like soy milk , are okay sources , but not as good as the real deal so i mix the two together to make sure my kids get the best possible calcium intake they can they would n't drink it just so though so improvised this company is great ! cow 's milk is just not good for people ! goat milk is infinitely better i use to make their mac and cheese and things like that too they can stand the little bit of lactose in the cheese powder , and by using the goat milk , you ca n't even tell there is anything different about the dish very useful . 
i started using goat milk when my daughter was 1 because she did not digest cow 's milk that well this product is great , has equal or more nutrition than cow 's milk , has a good flavor , just slightly different than cow 's milk , is easy to digest and best of all the powder form is great if you are on the go , i do n't have to worry about it spoiling i just mix and give it to my daughter . 
goat milk is very good for the digestive system fortunately , it performs many functions that the medical world is not aware of i can remember in the 40 's , my father curing his ulcers with goat milk he lived until the ripe old age of 94 i have friends who have discarded rx and over the counter products , in favor of goat milk to solve their digestive problems br br even though regular goat milk lasts long in the refrigerator , powered goat milk lasts longer , and is easily made when you need it plus , with the powder , you can customize the quality of the product to your taste br br it 's good for you and to you . 
this is by far the best tasting thing that 's come from a goat in years ! bullsburg creamery , man chowder dairy or goat coat ca n't hold a candle to this stuff drink it , bake it , snort it it 's all good . 
when i was young , my mom owned a couple goats that gave our family fresh milk recently , i discovered meyenberg powdered goat milk and was surprised to find out that it tastes just like the fresh goat 's milk i remember it even has the thick cream layer fresh milk has br br however , it would be awesome if the product came in larger cans i ended up emptying the 12 ounce can rather quickly because i used my large blender bottle to mix three cups at a time , and this , unfortunately , depleted one can of powdered milk in record time \( one can makes 12 cups liquid \) . 
after my doctors told me that i needed to supplement with formula and stop breastfeeding as much because my daughter did not gain enough weight , i knew i did not want to use fomula i found this goats milk and it not only helped her gain the weight she needed but it did not give her any gi upset this was a god send and my 11 month old is still just as happy as when she was breasfteeding she does not mind the taste and loves her bottles ! ! ! . 
my one year old daughter drinks this every day and she loves it ! i have n't accustomed myself to the gamey taste as other reviewers call it , but i'm thrilled that she is getting a whole fatted milk , free of hormones and overflowing with nutrition get 'em started early ! . 
i 've given up on cows milk products it interferes with my digestion , creates constipation and gas i decided to try this powdered goats milk because i remembered that my parents told me that i was allergic to cows milk when i was a baby and they gave me goats milk instead , but then switched me to cows milk when i was old enough to tolerate it i wish they had left me on the goats milk growing up because i find that my body tolerates it much better , and i think i would have been healthier as a child growing up if i 'd had goats milk instead of cows milk br br i use it to make my own kefir , yogurt , custards and whatever else i need milk for i was a bit dubious when i first bought it i did n't know if i would like the taste of it or not , but i love the taste and the smell of it mmmmmm yum the taste at first reminded me a tiny bit of the flavor of lamb and i love lamb but this taste is so slight that it 's not noticable in kefir \( which makes the most delicious pancakes \) , or yogurt or in custard or any other baked goods i like the taste and smell of this goats milk better than cows milk br br i also like the powdered milk because i can make it up a cup at a time or a quart at a time , as i need it , and never have to worry about having to store it in the refrigerator or it going bad or spoiling it 's very convenient br br it takes a few minutes for it to dissolve and be absorbed into warm water when first mixing it , but once it is all dissolved in the water , i ca n't tell the difference between this powdered milk and fresh milk it dissolves and mixes quickest in a blender . 
i love to feed my kids goats milk but to buy it fresh from the farm is so expensive , so this is a great substitute i started my kids on this when i stopped nursing and they 've loved it ever since they eat it in their cereal and drink it straight from the cup i think goats milk is the next best thing to breast milk ! . 
my daughter is allergic to all dairy and cannot have all the extra iron they pump into the poisness formulas that they say are sooo healthy for your babies growth this goats milk gives her all the nutrients that she needs i would suggest to any mother even if the baby is not allergic to dairy . 
we started with fresh goats milk and after 2 weeks transitioned to this product i prepare it with warm water in the blender and add some strawberry flavoring my son \( 17 months \) loves it very easy to prepare , and compared to baby formula very reasonable in price . 
the flavor is very good 45 seconds in the microwave and one measure of this milk and you are done \( stir \) i can noticed the difference between the whole milk from cow and this goat milk it is much much better to digest . 
after shopping around , this is by far the best deal on powdered goat 's milk . 
this product is very easy to use and is good for people \( and pets \) that are lactose intolerant i use it as a treat for my ferrets and they love it ! it can help sick ferrets feel better and gain weight thank you for offering something so easy to use ! . 
el gastroenterologo pediatra recomendo este tipo de leche para mis hijos , ya que las demas formulas lacteas le causaban una alergia que les hacia vomitar . 
i use this in combination with baby 's only formula for my daughter unfortunately , due to illness , my milk production took a plunge when she was 5 months old although , it breaks my heart that i can only nurse a little , i feel better using goat 's milk \( easy for baby belly 's to digest \) i add baby 's only so she gets the vital nutrients she needs if you are looking to supplement your child , consider using raw local goat 's milk \( if you are lucky enough to have it around \) this stuff is great . 
this product is the best choice for adding calcium vitd and protein in your diet cow 's milk gives me stomach trouble whereas this does n't i drink it regularly myself i also add the powder in my home made baby food for my son starting around 6 months powdered form has an additional benefit you can reconstitute it into whatever concentration you 'd like yum ! . 
we 've been using meyenberg powdered goat milk for our little girl since she was 6 months of age my wife and i love this product we opted not to feed our child any formula milk out there my wife breastfeeds and due to low breast milk production , we also feed our child goats milk dr sears has an awesome web page on info about goats milk and it 's uses for babies . 
i have been drinking this powdered goat milk for years ! it is the best no after taste with all the immune boosting benefits ! i have an 8mos old and plan to feed him this starting on his first birthday , i cannot wait ! my husband grew up on goat milk and has the best immunity ! this is so easy to digest within 20 minutes vs cow milk which takes more than 24 hrs ! br br above all it tastes so delish ! ! ! ! ! yummmy ! br br amazon truly has unbelievable price ! luv my amazon \) . 
this is a great price for powdered goat milk at the local health food store \( the only place in town that carries goat milk \) , i buy just one of these cans for 15 20 for three cans is the best price i 've found ! br br i use goat milk for my children , when they are in the process of weaning , and as long as they want it it is so much healthier than formula because , well , it 's not soy or dairy based , and has no chemicals and added vitamins that try to mimic breastmilk goat milk is more similar to breastmilk than dairy , so is much easier for humans to digest than cow milk i find it to be a great alternative for babies as they adjust , or for those who cannot tolerate dairy br br for warm bottles for my 14 month old , i just heat water on the stove , then pour it into her glass bottle with a scoop of goat milk shake it up and she has her favorite drink \( other than momma 's milk , of course \) ! . 
works well instead of formula or soy milk for my daughters bottle easy to mix as long as water is warmed and she loves the taste ! plus much more affordable than buying goat milk cartons in the store . 
the kids like to drink , drinking a can of the fast if the formula is better and but to shake to mix evenly . 
we wanted to use milk that was lactose free and close to breast milk we began using this milk to supplement my breast milk and we now use it full time my baby has never had an allergic reaction to it and he does n't spit up it 's gentle on his stomach and amazon has it at an inexpensive price i would suggest this milk to any parent that prefers something different than cow 's milk . 
the can looks just like the pic and it really helped my son with his constipation i love it and he started drinking it with no problem at 2 3months old ! ! ! love it . 
now that my lo is exclusively formula fed , i use it once a day to supplement his feeds he took to it after the first two feeds and now likes it very much the only problem i had was with the powder it does n't blend well or instantly , but great product none the less . 
we used to get this from our local grocery store for our 10month baby girl but it was 2 more a can and with prime there is no shipping charges as well as no taxes yay ! our baby loves this and it really has cut down on her spitting up . 
our qh mare gave birth to a beautiful clydesdale quarter horse cross colt 3 weeks ago it was her first baby and not only did she reject him , but she attacked him then he was attacked by a dog because his mother was not protecting him he spent the first 7 days of his life in an equine neonatal intensive care unit regular mare 's milk replacer gave him diarrhea , so they added goats milk , which stopped the diarrhea when we brought him home , we looked for a constant source of goat milk to add to his formula the meyenberg powdered goat milk works great ! we add it to his formula and he loves it even better , he is able to digest his milk better and is thriving thank you amazon and meyenberg for a product that helped to save our foal 's life . 
i do n't like non organic dairy , but this stuff comes close goats are not given steroids or hormones as far as i know the taste is usually very consistent , but it does take some getting used to the powder mixes very well , and it is handy when on the road and need to mix a protein shake it improves the taste of protein shakes and that 's my favorite thing about this very recommended . 
excellent stuff ! my baby is allergic to dairy and soy br this is the only formula she could tolerate it br smells but she loves it ! when they are under a year br old you add brown rice syrup to give more calories br then you gradually wean them off of the brown br syrup so by the time they are a year they are drinking br straight goats milk . 
my 5mo daughter has a severely sensitive stomach associated to an iron intolerance she 's been formula fed since the beginning due to my personal choice i went through 8 different commerical milk based and soy based formulas a good friend of ours suggested goat 's milk her nephew was a failure to thrive baby and the only formula he did n't throw up was goat 's milk i can easily find the liquid goat 's milk at our local grocery store unfortunately , i have yet to come across the powder at said grocery store i was home visiting my parents and was in search of the liquid , but found the powder strange that a smaller grocery store in a much smaller metropolitian area would have the powder versus a very large grocery store in the us 's 4th largest metropolitian who just has the liquid br br anyways , after 8 weeks of trial error , we have a very happy 5mo baby i wish would have found this milk earlier br i added a mixture of goat 's milk and pulp free , plain coconut water into my daughter 's feedings and it not only has cleaned her system out , but has stopped the colic , vomiting , reflux , constipation and to replace her electrolytes again , i will repeat lower iron content equals happier , calmer baby we still have the lingering green poops compliments of the iron oxidation however , the iron tolerance has been greatly minimized no colic , no vomiting , no reflux and no constipation she has one bottle of coconut water goat 's milk every day just to keep the gi tract from metabolizing the excess iron proteins and to replace her ever so important electrolytes ironically , she actually takes this formula mixture better than the traditional formulas ! ! . 
i use this for my twins and they love it , never had any problems i just wish it were cheaper ! . 
wonderful product ! i began to use it for my daughter who was about to turn a year old she took it with no problems ! it was recommended by a friend who also used it when she too had to stop breastfeeding much better for a child in my eyes i had tried a formula sample i had received in the mail it left a greasy film in the bottle gross this does not ! my daughter will drink it warm or cold so easy for on the go as well the canned was a bit harsh and she was n't into it it tastes like a goat smells this just has a suttle hint of goat lol . 
i use goat milk for everything i use it to replace cow milk in all my recipes and for coffee and it works well for me the price is great ! highly recommend it . 
decent price arrived on time no complaints here we will continue to purchase this item br my daughter loves her goat milk \) . 
i use this to make goat milk yogurt very tasty br needs to be well stirred , but well worth the time . 
i have been exclusively breat feeding my son , so when the 6 month mark came up and had to introduce solids i was nervous i knew breastmilk was the best thing to mix cereal with , but i really didnt want to mess with the hassel of pumping ! i tried whole milk \( ok per pediatrician \) , which made him so fussy \( , then water , he would n't eat it then i did actually try some breastmilk i had frozen from the early weeks of nursing , he still refused it ! i then heard on the dr oz show that goats milk is most like breat milk and thats what brought me to this product ! i was so happy to find this product for him , he eats his cereal with no problems now and absolutly no tummy problems either \) no pumping and no formula needed ! could n't ask for anything better ! highly reccomended ! . 
this stuff is fantastic my little girl loves it and it gives me the piece of mind knowing that i am not feeding her a huge amount of sugar with mainstream formulas not to mention the other things they have found in them recently this is the closest thing to mothers milk if your baby spits up a lot you should definitely try this stuff my little girl has n't spit up since i switched ever love it just wish i could buy even more at a time . 
i started my son on this powdered milk and he transitioned easily from breast milk without any problems i use a gallon container and mix the whole can \( 3 quarts \) at once with luke warm water and it works out perfectly i really like this company and their product and love that this milk is also vit d fortified once my son gets older and he consumes less milk we will transition to the fresh goat milk , since right now it does n't fit in our budget . 
my daughter is sensitive to cow 's milk so we tried goat milk and it works well amazon is the cheapest place to purchase this stuff ! the powder sometimes has a hard time mixing with the water but not too bad recommend to anyone needing a healthy alternative to cow 's milk . 
in a world toxic from factory farming , unnatural additives feed \( mad cow anyone \? \) making sick cows \( rbgh and pus in the milk \) i avoid any dairy not from grass fed cows if you shop organic , you know how expensive this is for animal products so far as i know , goat dairy is free from these evils br br i tried goat products after reading a couple books on natural diet and healing by dr jordan rubin the maker 's diet is good , but the protocols repetitive , and he is of course promoting his products he designed to recover from crohn 's coconut oil and goat milk were important for reasons you need to read yourself anyhow , it helped me , improve my health too i find i have less congestion , allergies , and sinus problems br br the goaty flavor can be overcome by a gradual switchover mixing some goat milk into whatever milk you use be it cow 's , soy , rice after a while you will not notice it much , then you may like it ! i bet after a month or two of no cow 's milk , you will taste cowy flavor in it our tastebuds change br br i like both the evaporated and powdered milks my cats do too and it has been okay for feeding a sick cat who could n't manage solid food br br i am going to make some cultured goat milk products , since yogurt is over 2 a plastic cup in ohio maybe cheese will be next goat farmers cheese \? mmm . 
it is a very nice milk powder i do n't have any allergies in particular but i am genetically lactose intolerant if i have more than 2 glasses of milk in a day , my stomach will feel all acidic i do n't face that same problem with this milk i drink this over the liquid one sold at stores because this has more value for money and has got folic acid in it be warned though , if you do n't like the smell of goat meat , you might not particularly like this since it has a bit of that smell it mixes very well with hot water and not so well with normal water despite all of that , i love it and use it to make my milkshake . 
my 15 month old has been on this for 3 months and loves it br it is easy to make , \( you do have to shake it a bit when you make it \) br we add probiotics to it , for a little extra immune boosting and it br works great as a substitute for milk br our naturalpathic doc tells us this is easier on the toddlers digestive br system and may even aid in less ear infections br so far so good ! br amazon has the best deal we could find also ! . 
this is a really good source for goats milk i found this online at amazon and it is the least expensive price i 've found i order it regularly . 
i am very pleased with my recent purchase of meyeberg powdered goat milk i have shopped around locally and this is by far the best price per can i could find it was delivered as promised . 
we put this \( in powdered form \) on our dogs' food as a supplement \( according to breeder instructions \) with great results it sort of stinks , but the dogs love it and they 're both better eaters with it than without . 
excellent service goat milk is delivered in premium condition i will continue to order online thank you . 
my son is allergic to cow 's milk , and this is a great nutritious alternative ! plus , it 's more like breastmilk . 
this is a great price , and easy way to purchase powdered goats milk the cheapest i 've found , and the quickest shipping i 've ever experienced from amazon . 
this is the best alternative to cows milk for the first 2 years my daughter loves it and it is easier for her to digest and has been known to lesson the occurance of certain allergies in children in given in place of whole milk that is recommended up 'til age 2 this is my second child that i am using it with and i love it and so do they . 
we love this product we 've also got our little grandbaby hooked on it , when she comes to visit she 's now 2 we feel more comfortable with her drinking goat milk than cow 's milk much easier to digest love that meyenberg sometimes , though , we find better prices elsewhere on the internet . 
thanks a lot for the review starflakes we have n't made ice cream with it yet , we will be trying it our daughter is now 3 , and is also allergic to cows milk and soy we found it works well in recipes that can support the heavy cream or buttermilk flavor , like pancakes and mashed potatoes br br to the person with the bad review , we had a lot of trouble transitioning to other milks we currently mix the whole can plus a quart of fresh milk to make a gallon and a half \( weaker concentration than suggested \) our daughter also demands that we heat it to at least lukewarm \( 45 sec in microwave \) i thank starflakes again for the explanation that it does taste better warm br br we will also sometimes add in a pint of goat yogurt in our blend \( usually to the half gallon portion \) we bought a few cans of the condensed for emergency use , when we tried to use the can on a trip , she would n't drink it \( though we did n't have the normal to blend it with \) br br even blending it with a quart of fresh milk , we go through 2 3 cans a week , and started buying it by the case when our local store could n't keep up with our demand , even then we frequently buy them out waiting for the next case hopefully the online supply is more reliable in addition to costing less . 
i do not drink cow milk and was on soy which was sinking me further into estrogen dominance remembering that i had liked goat milk when i had the opportunity to drink it fresh from the goat in my home country i started to do some research online to see if it would be a good substitute and what do you know , it was yes it is not fresh straight from the goat milk , but being able to have it again has been a blessing thank you mayenberg for both the powdered and evaporated milk thank you amazon for offering it a price that is not breaking my purse . 
my baby is allergic to cow 's milk and this is so much cheaper and better than the hypoallergenic formula he loves this stuff ! . 
this stuff apparently has a shelf life of many weeks , even after opening and it tastes ok in tea and coffee , once you get used to it , which is more than i can say for soy milk br br but , i give it just 4 stars because it 's so hard to mix now , if they added some modern chemicals to allow easier mixing , even if it caused an allergic reaction , i still would n't vote for newt gingrich . 
this is great for a quick , easy , versatile dessert when you do n't want to heat up the oven although it does n't taste exactly like cheesecake , it 's a pretty good cheesecake like dessert for the price i like to make the mini cheesecakes suggested on the box and top them with fruit one note of caution amazon 's cost per box is a little high in this pack of 12 , each box of mix costs about 2 30 , but a box costs around 1 80 in my local target so , i recommend this product , and i suggest buying it at a local store . 
i love this product it is so easy to make and it 's done in minutes it has a great flavor , and i love that there are so many packs because as soon as you finish one you want another . 
this cheesecake is easy to make and easy to love ! i love to bake but do n't always have the time to start a cheesecake from scratch when i need one it 's easy to make this unique with adding swirled chocolate sauce or cherries to decorate i like making the mini ones , people can pick one up and devour ! . 
love this because 1 it is easy to make br 2 you get a good amount for your money ! . 
chrysanthemum tea taste great with lemons and apriva chrysanthemum tea is caffeine free that 's great for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure . 
after recently having a chance to try out all the flavors of these brand new david 's signature beyond gourmet jelly beans , i have to say the pomegranate is by far my favorite the flavor is just perfect sweet , but not too sweet not tart or overpowering in flavor it 's mild and the taste is just right the beans appearance is even beautiful ! with their rich red color and shine , they look like little glistening rubies that catch the light you can even taste the difference in how these are made using natural ingredients and coloring they actually have a fresh taste to them not hard , artificial and stale tasting like so many other brands these are a truly gourmet jelly beans . 
these david 's signature beyond gourmet pomegranate jelly beans are spot on in flavor and are just fantastic tasting this flavor is from david klein , the creator of the famous jelly belly jelly beans , so i was thrilled to be offered this in a href http www amazon com gp product b007jbo41e david 's signature beyond gourmet jelly beans flavor sampler a to review since my family loves jelly beans br br i also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors br br highly recommended ! br br cfh . 
great on the go snack to take in the car for my 3 and 5 year old ! no messy hands like other snacks keeps the car much cleaner ! \) also great for me as a weight watcher snack with a wedge of laughing cow lite cheese ! yum ! ! ! . 
they 're not hard as a rock , or so soft that if you dip them , they 'll break for a diet pretzel , these are great \( but then again , snyders of hanover has been at it for a long time \) . 
pretzels are too easy to just keep eating until the bag is done therefore , a 100 calorie option gives me the pause i need \( before i open another snack sized bag \) , to decide and therefore think before just eating all 60 packages \( yikes ! \) we use them in lunches , as snacks , as halloween treats , at the beach , at the pool , at work , in the car \( now i am becoming a dr seuss book \) br br the shipments we have received \( 2 so far \) have not been stale , soggy or out of date . 
as a motorcoach tour operator , i'm always looking for high quality , reasonably priced snacks to offer to my customers on my trips snyder 's is a respected brand and i appreciate being able to purchase bulk quantities of their pretzels at such a great low price . 
this is a great deal for the amount of pretzel packs that are given we love these since they 're only 100 calories each and perfect for a snack , pair with a sandwich , or just to stick in your purse if you get hungry . 
they are just that 100 calorie bags of pretzels snyder 's tends to have one of the best tasting pretzels according to my taste buds these bags create instant portion control and are a great value for the price , especially with subscribe and save i also throw them in the kids' lunch bags and keep some in the car for road trips . 
great buy but it seems that they are not very popular in my office \( less healthy chip snacks are more popular \) still a great product , fresh and tastes like a pretzel should without any additives . 
do you seriously need a review for pretzels \? it 's either going to be these pretzels are delicious ! or maybe these pretzels are disgusting ! thats pretty much all you can say about pretzels i personally think they are delicious , but of course i like pretzels , if you dont , then youll probably want to go the other way on this one . 
i personally think these are the best pretzels on earth i have to admit , that when it comes to eating pretzels , these are the first in my mouth . 
first thing in the morning it is nice to have a hot cup of coffee to wake you up while you watch the news we have always drunk maxwell house coffee and even when i was a child my parents used it it is one of the best coffee brands available as we have gotten older we needed to consume less caffeine and we actually brew a mixture of part of this coffee and part of the maxwell house decaf blend it helps us reduce our caffeine and we still get to enjoy our coffee in the morning with just a little kick in it br br the price of the coffee here is about the right list price but the shipping is a killer adder on sale at a local store we get it for less than half the price and no shipping this is a very good product and i recommend it to you . 
for coffee drinkers who buy maxwell house coffee , this is a deal ! buy two cases for just over 50 ! free shipping , too ! seriously , you know i stocked up ! . 
when it does come down to my mornings , i always do enjoy a good cup of coffee to start my days off right but , i have chosen to drink more ground coffee than instant these days but it has also been much harder finding the right kind of great tasting cup , and that does definitely come well with maxwell house and the simple original roast blend the taste is definitely simple and not too string for most new coffee drinkers , but elequent enough to get your mornings off to a great start with each and every savory cup while there are n't many great brands of coffee that 've shown that test of time , maxwell house has been one that has n't lost its shine i absolutely recommend this brand each and every time br br price b br br taste b br br overall b . 
my husband is a big coffee drinker , and with a deal like this i can order ahead and never have to worry about running out i hate to have to run to the store because i am out of one thing . 
what can i say great cookies the only way to improve it is if it came with some cold milk . 
what 's to say about oreos \? the originals are still the best i do n't get them often because gluttony overcomes me one , two , or even a few is n't possible for me . 
pamela 's baking and pancake mix is very , very good however , know when you order in the small packages you are not getting the baking mix you are getting individual \( or for two people \) servings of pancake and waffle mix this formula is different than that for the larger packages of baking and pancake mix and does not make biscuits , muffins , or other short breads very well , too sweet for my taste if you are looking for great tasting pancake or waffles in a smaller package , then this is for you if you are looking for a great baking mix as well as pancakes and waffles , then get the larger packages . 
i 've tried many different cheeses , and i have to say gorgonzola is my most favorite br br the texture , aroma and flavor is both bold and pleasant yet not overbearing br br a highly recommended cheese for novice cheese enthusiasts . 
i love this mix i use it in several different recipes its moist and has a good consistency the only problem is that its difficult to find and i end up buying it on line ! any suggestions \? \? \? . 
i have been drinking v 8 juice for many years ordering it from amazon by the case with free shipping \( prime \) allows me to have it on hand in a convenient can with the right amount for my needs . 
the package arrived with all the cans inside of a cardboard tray that was shrink wrapped there was no damage to the cans and they tasted just fine br br as far as v 8 itself br br i enjoy using v 8 as a meal replacement \( replacing a greasy breakfast \) think of it as tomato soup with a little less flavoring it was an acquired taste for me that i have since come to enjoy if you find that the original is a bit on the bland side , you can try the spicy flavor as a nice alternative the only drawback is that spicy has a bit more sodium . 
he says it tastes great and is a great snack for his diabetes good source of vitamins for him great shipping , on our second order . 
great price and we did not have to leave the house and shop i really love the fact that there is no trouble with ordering great product . 
yes it is mainly a tomato juice and yes it has sodium in it , but it is definitely still better than drinking coke and its just a better alternative of drinks to bring to school or work \) . 
tastes like v8 cuz it is v8 o \) delivered on time my doctor says i dont get as much nutrition benefit as i thought i did because of the pasteurization process but i dont eat lots of veggies and i like this stuff sooooo i drink it anyway . 
i have been a vegetarian for 15 years and have a meat eating husband for years , i have been looking for a good ground beef substitute i finally found one this one had a good taste and texture when cooked my meat eating husband is even happy with it when i use it one of the things i love is that i use this to make meatballs , and they stay together in the past , they never stayed together this is a great product , and i'm happy i found it . 
very meaty texture for a vegetarian product looks like fresh ground beef after you mix it with water i would recommend this product i also want to try the sausage variety . 
i first received a bag of harmony valley as a prize on a contest on ecorazzi com i was very pleasantly surprised at the texture and taste i made stuffed green peppers with it just as you would a traditional recipe substituting the mix my husband , who is a avid meat eater really enjoyed it and said he would not mind eating more often i also made the sausage style in an omelet with peppers and onions and it was tasty i ordered a pack of six of the burger mix right here on amazon ! . 
i'm a meat eater , my wife 's vegetarian she picked some of this veggie burger mix up to try , and we both really like it ! i'm not saying it tastes like beef , but i do n't believe it 's supposed to it 's really good ! and i 'd recommend it to anyone \) . 
i have been a vegetarian for about a year now , so i am relatively new to the meat substitute market but this is by far the best veggie burger mix i have tried far better then any of the frozen patties you can get in grocery stores an added bonus is the versatility of the mix you can use it for many different things instead of just being stuck with patty form like the frozen variety my meat eating girlfriend really likes this as well , and she tends to be pretty picky . 
i tried the vegetarian hamburger mix and i liked it more than any other burger substitute i 've tried i made it into salsbury steaks and topped them with a mushroom gravy delicious ! a href http www amazon com gp product b00474h936 harmony valley vegetarian hamburger mix , 5 7 ounce \( pack of 6 \) a . 
i have used harmony valley hamburger substitute several times now and have been very happy it is spiced and tastes pretty close to a meatball mixture when used in sauce or to stuff peppers i cannot tell that it is not hamburger meat i was thrilled with its performance and its ease of use i ca n't wait to try it in other recipes . 
great product ! br br i purchased this product from our local fresh market i am a vegan and am always looking for different meat substitutes to try i used this mix to make some taco mince this stuff was perfect ! i even got my non veg father to try a bite of the tacos and he thought they were good as well that right there is saying something , because my father is really iffy about mock meats br br i have another packet in which i am going to cook up today ! . 
some of my family are vegetarians but the rest are die hard meat eaters this is one product that the whole family will eat we like it as burgers but we love it as meatloaf and meatballs in spaghetti we like that it keeps a good texture even when simmered in sauce i love that it has the texture and 'bite' that hamburger has as an extra bonus , i'm on weight watchers and it 's low in points ! . 
we just received a package of the hamburger mix from one of our dearest friends as a gift we loved it i am vegetarian and my husband is a meat eater i whipped up some stuffed bell peppers using the mix and it was delicious i love that it is a great price as well ! . 
i love all three products that harmony valley has but the vegetarian hamburger mix is my familys favorite , we love to make taco salad , sloppy joes , meatless meatballs , hamburgers , salisbury steak , spaghetti with this great product , if you love the store bought vegi burgers that are found in the frezzer section of your store these are 100 times better so fresh tasting gmo free ! thanks harmony valley for making such a great safe to eat product ! p s the plant is ran on wind power ! ! gmo free is the way for me . 
i have tried almost every kind of fake meat product out there while i really like the morning stars and the boca ground meat you ca n't really make them into anything br br this product was great soak it for 15 minutes in water , and viola you have a really good ground meat you can make something out of , the only problem is that it tends to be a little saly for my taste , so be carefull when you are seasoning it . 
i'm not vegetarian , but i'm on the fat smash diet by dr ian the 1st few days he suggest going meatless before building a foundation and reintroducing chicken , fish , and then other meats i made chili with this it does n't taste just like meat or anything like that , but the texture is spot on when u mix in a bunch of other things i'm not sure how it would turn out just on a bun if i go that route i will have to season very well before making the chili i was a little worried so i cooked up all my veggies and seasoning in a separate pot browned this beef in another pan and added it into the mix later cooking this alone it smelled funny , and i was worried it would taste the way it smelled i'm very sensitive to smell and taste of things i can taste this in the mix of things but not so much more than anything i'm busy looking for a taste one thing i can say is the texture is pretty good for the consistency of meat except its much lighter and thinner less clumpy than real ground beef if i had to give up beef for the rest of my life and pick this i would n't but if cows disappeared off the face of the earth i would be fine with taking this as a substitute . 
good tea good for blood pressure tastes good and smells good too webvitamins good place to order from fast and efficient , especially with amazon as the go between . 
i have been drinking three cups of this tea for the last month and a half i just had my annual checkup with my doctor and my blood pressure was 108 60 ! ! ! ! after years of it being it the 140 's or 135 's my blood pressure is now like a young person and i am in my sixties i had been monitoring my blood pressure at home and it was good but usually when i see the doctor it shoots up because i am nervous but not this time my doctor was thrilled i totally believe that this tea has lowered my blood pressure and i will continue drinking it i steep it for 10 minutes i have two cups after breakfast and one cup after dinner it tastes good and i do n't put any sweetener in it i highly recommend it as it did work for me . 
i have been drinking hibiscus tea off and on since 1984 when i went to germany in 1984 , my mother told me that it is quite popular there for blood pressure issues , so every day while i was there i drank it when i came back to the us i found it and drank it for a number of years br br about a year ago my husband 's blood pressure became elevated because of health problems he is experieincing so , i went to the local co op and got some hibiscus tea ever since he started drinking it his blood pressure has been in the normal range well under 120 80 . 
hibiscus tea 24 bags , i 've got this tea for my dad to help him with his blood pressure , it is a little early to tell i also taking it myself , i like all kinds of tea , green , triple leaf tea , this one has a very deep purple color and nice fruity flavor , i really like it hibiscus tea is the combination of two herbs hibiscus is cultivated throughout the tropics , its flowers are highly prized for making jams , jellies , sauces and beverages br br lemongrass is a sub tropical herb known for its strong citrus flavor and aroma it became a popular edition to tea blends in the 1970s and was quickly accepted in europe by blending these tropical flavours together , they have created a tart and fruity tea that is kid friendly and truly wonderful hot or cold i also like the fact that this tea does not contain any caffeine , that usually keeps me up , no problem with hibiscus tea it tastes great ! thank you . 
tastes great does not need sugar i am trying to see if my pressure goes down i will update later j . 
great tasting tea and very healthy i was very surprised and will probably be ordering more it does cost but the cheapest i have found . 
this is good tasting tea , no need for sugar i am drinking one cup per day usually at mid day for blood pressure i am not sure how long it takes to help lower bp but if it helps even a little it 's worth drinking especially since its very tasty . 
i love to make sun tea with these tea bags , it is very nice on a hot day to sit with a chilled glass it is tasty and not too sweet , highly recommended ! . 
i love this tea from arizona tea hot or cold i call it my bubble gum tea this is a very pleasing tea that has a wonderful aroma and taste just like the arizona tea in the bottles only hot it is very relaxing in the evening or invigorating in the morning or anytime for that matter i highly recommend it if you like green tea . 
i am not a fan of green teas , but i really love this one it has a nice non tea taste it 's hard to find in stores so i got the 6 pack great price and shipped really fast . 
this makes great iced tea more flavor than regular tea refreshing recommend it hard to find in stores get it here . 
i have always enjoyed this particular tea , plain and simple a great green tea with a hint of ginseng and honey ! i buy it on amazon because i ca n't find it in my area , so it 's worth it ! . 
this product was difficult to find in stores but easy to find through amazon i will order items by this method again . 
i love this stuff ! i sit in front of a computer all day at work , it 's easy to get tired , not to mention i 've always had trouble sleeping , so i never get a full 7 or 8 hours of sleep , more like an average of 4 or 5 hours per night i was surprised at how quickly it boosted me but i certainly did n't feel the shakes or jittery at all i felt more awake , and i did n't crash from it later it wears off gradually after a few hours but it helps to get through the main part of the day i do n't use it every day but on occassion when i need a boost . 
i have had possibly every energy drink and this one is possibly the best great energy and no crash mixes well with everything and my friends love it will buy again ! . 
i first tried this energy drink on a 1500 mile iron butt motorcycle ride in which you have 36 hours to complete , not an easy task , but ammo energy shots kept me alert small container , so carrying a few was compact no adverse affects from the caffeine we had the after dark flavor and now i want to try the others . 
i ushally get this curry cat at the store but they stopped carring it it helps me remember the tast of some foods from germany i will shop here again when i need some more . 
i went to a gourmet store and asked for their chocolate expert to recommend a chocolate among the high end makers he pointed out this brand , which was affordable as well as incredibly flavorful if you need a chocolate to melt in your mouth , savor the santander 53 cocoa . 
this 53 percent cocoa semi dark chocolate bar is the perfect choice for people who dont usually like dark chocolate tasting nothing at all likke common dark chocolates like hershey 's \( yuck \) , santander 's quality is excellent i highly recommend this and all other santander chocaltes . 
santanders 53 semi sweet dark chocolate bar is by far their best bar in my opinion the 65 is pretty good also , but it 's more smooth and balanced , whereas the 53 is just goodness from start to finish and has a wonderful creamy flavor br br i 've tried their 53 , 65 , 70 and also their espresso 70 one the 53 is the best \( by a long shot \) , then the 65 comes in 2nd place the others are very good too , but do n't quite have the amazing overall rich creamy wonderfulness of the 53 bar br br if you are not sure which bar to buy , the 53 bar is an excellent choice if you like see 's candy and or godiva , then you 'll be right at home with this bar it 's one of the single best dark chocolate bars i have ever had in my life . 
you will not find better tasting soup anywhere i initially purchased it because my wife is sensitive to msg and other kinds of additives that are found in most soups after eating some myself i now keep a supply on hand for all of the family . 
this soup is absolutely delicious ! the chicken tastes like real chicken not processed fake meat and , the wild rice adds just a bit of yummy crunch for some reason i think it 's way better than the chicken noodle one if you eat strictly organic , it 's perfect for when you do n't have time to make a fresh meal . 
i normally hate canned soup but this one is an exception ! great flavor and the chicken , carrots and rice actually seem 'real' not imitation or over processed like all the other canned soups i 've tried . 
delicious , organic , full of flavor and a hit at our house ! plump rice , fat carrots , tasty chicken a great soup ! . 
i love rice and this was good with all kinds of textures ! i am allergic to so many things but this soup was awesome and no hives ! win win ! . 
this soup is incredibly good ! but honestly , i was looking for a better deal through amazon the free shipping is great , but it 's over 3 bucks a can , and i can get it cheaper through my grocery store they are always having wp sales for 2 bucks a can , 2 50 a can so does anyone know about a better deal than this \? it 's a really good tasting soup ! . 
it 's my favorite soup and you ca n't beat the amazon price with free shipping thanks for making my favorites available . 
i love having a soup that is healthy and not full of bad ingredients i like the chicken noodle better , but the rice is pretty good too . 
this soup is simply the best been ordering for a very long time and will continue to do so br great soup and product . 
the soup itself was excellent a nice , well tasting mix of meat , veggies and wild and white rices , but surely a few more chunks of chicken could have been added i bought it at local grocer two cans for 4 . 
very tasty but my only complaint is that it 's very oily if you let it sit and cool , it develops a fatty skin , and my plastic spoon gets a film on it while i'm eating i gave it 5 stars anyway b c it 's still the best canned chicken and rice soup i 've ever tasted but outside of canned soup , homemade is always better . 
very good white chocolate and very fresh too ! ty ! thank you for wrapping securely quick shipment was appreciated very much ! . 
this coffee \( er , koffee \) is superb ! i am lucky enough to live where this is roasted i can get my kinetic fix at the local grocery stores you can taste the care put into this flavorful espresso living in a small town , i happen to know the roasters you would be hard pressed to find better people they are active participants of the great arcata to ferndale world championship cross country kinetic sculpture race if you have n't heard of it , look it up we are a strange people , here in arcata . 
first quality , dogs like it and it does not have grain as an ingredient , therefore a reduction in ear infections due to yeast infections . 
my dogs love this food and with the limited ingredients and low allergins , it makes it great for them as well . 
wow , organic lentils , how great is that ! lentils are one of the planet 's top 10 super foods , extremely high in protein and fiber , extremely low on the glycemic index and inflammation scale this is one food i try to eat everyday i live in a pretty unsophisticated town in the central valley of california , and you 'd think our high end supermarket , raley 's , would carry organic lentils , but of course , they do n't , and even if they did , i 'd have to pay an arm and leg for them amazon is my lifeline for quality organic foods and other products incidentally , i do n't make the typical lentil soup with these i simply cook one bag \( 16 oz \) with about 7 5 cups of non fluoridated bottled water \( fluoride is extremely bad for your thyroid \) , salt them to taste , and only cook them for 25 minutes this way , they do n't get mushy they keep their firmness without being too chewy , more like a bean , and then i keep them in the fridge for a week , and have them with a little organic shredded cheese on top yummy ! . 
these are such high quality beans , no stones , great taste , cook , and freeze and thaw perfectly ! i will order again and again ! . 
that all that need to be said the best chocolate candy with the best service and add a great price and it just can not be beat the item arrived on time and in good shape like most items ordered through amazon . 
what i like about these is that they are gluten free , full of flavor and have a hearty corn flavor they are a bit thicker than some of the chips i 've tried out there and hold the salsa ! love these ! . 
these chips rock ! we have tried just about every kind of chip lately looking for something that is lower priced , more natural but still taste good these chips taste great perfectly salted \( not too salty and can be enjoyed plain \) , excellent crunch and corn flavor and best of all the shape ! the long rectangular shape are the perfect size for dipping and are just thick enough to hold any dip or salsa best part they are made with only 4 natural ingredients ! . 
i love the crunch taste of the corn strips my whole family loves them too ! . 
my husband and i love these chips they are n't very salty and the strip shape makes them great for dipping in salsa dips two of my favorite things about these chips though 1 \) when you open the bag , the bag still looks pretty full unlike many other brands where the bag look half full at best when you open it 2 \) there are n't ever very many broken chips . 
these chips are my family 's favorite they are absolutely fabulous with guacamole because they are not too salty they pick up salsa well too , especially fresh salsa because of their shape you get just the right amount of salsa these chips do n't take over the dip , they compliment whatever you dip them in they 're fine without dip also , but if you are used to a salty chip , you might find them a bit plain tortilla chips are a staple at our house and these are the best you can get except in an authentic mexican restaurant br br hope you enjoy them as much as we do . 
if you 're looking for a healthy , natural tortilla chip for dipping , you should try these i bought these for the holidays and we enjoyed dipping them in a corn , black bean and red pepper salsa the shape is perfect for dipping br they 're all natural , low calorie chips that taste great you can eat 12 chips for 130 calories the chips are big and can be broken in half for more dipping one serving of 12 chips is only 10 of your allowed fat and there 's no trans fat and little saturated fat ca n't wait to try them with guacamole great treat for parties . 
this is a mild , buttery scented cheese my favorite cheese made in the united states . 
i bought these for my grandson who is 7 months old he loves them and they are just the right size for a snack between feedings his mom likes the convenience and ease in taking them along i like ordering these and having them shipped directly to their house it makes me feel like i have sent them a little present that is practical and appreciated . 
my son is 7 months old and this has always been his favorite baby food it is nice a thick , which he loves ! . 
i am a bit of a foodie and have become quite picky over the years i have to say , hands down , this is my favorite olive oil it 's affordable and non pretentious amazing flavor i use a lot of olive oil in cooking and this is great for that and just by itself to drag a piece of crusty bread through or to drizzle over caprese i definitely recommend this to anyone looking and unsure of what to buy because who knows \? but this one is a keeper and a must try ! . 
a brother in a sicilian family who owns an italian food market deli here in san diego , tipped me off to this product over a year ago the difference it made in salads and vegetables , sauces and meats was unbelievable there is a pleasingly clean , peppery bite that makes it distinctive , adding a bold delicious flavor to fresh salads , cooked vegetables and roasted chicken and meats i 've tried many other brands of extra virgin , pure , select or other types of olive oils growing up in an italian household and in my 66 years , none of them stimulated the taste buds with the savory satisfaction delivered by academia barilla extra virgin olive oil the product is not widely known but the laboratories at academia barilla in italy have developed as good a commercial product as is currently on the market and in my opinion , it is the very best the cost is high but consistent with the higher end oils but , if you enjoy fine foods and preparing aromatic dishes , simply put , this oil turns them into a gift use it and enjoy the satisfying reaction and comments of dinner guests as they realize they are being treated to a very special dinning experience quality makes a difference . 
sure , this rawhide is expensive at 5 6 dollars per rawhide however , it is excellent quality \( many rolls very tightly rolled \) and takes my gsd hours to go through one for reference , he can eat a thick bully stick in 5 minutes and a himalayan dog chew in 30 minutes for the time spent chewing per dollar , these rawhides are a deal ! i also love that my dogs ca n't get big chunks off , so even though i keep an eye on them i have very little fear of choking . 
i mix 2 scoops of this and two scoops of formula in my son 's bottle and it keeps him full longer my mother says she used it on me when i was a child and it kept my cheeks rosy and me full my son seems to really enjoy it . 
well it 's funny but even though i am 28 yrs old i love eating this in many flavors , i was born here and did not get the chance to grow up on this till almost three where my family went overseas and they used this nestle brand and i am hooked till now , it 's really hard to get it here as i live in nh so i order it online br i really like it , and would recommend it and will defiantly feed it to my kids when i get some . 
this the best flavor out of all the others my daugther loves it and it is easy to make and very nutritional too . 
sweet tasty but there is not sugar , baby love it better than gerber like mellin , milupa or plasmon brand . 
this is a great product my son loves it still , i like better the 8 cereal with honey that somehow is not available in the us but you can find it in europe . 
i switched to sea salt a couple of years ago and have found these mccormick grinders very handy ways of dispensing my attraction was the price this deal is better than any i have found in local grocery stores even with shipping handling well worth the price shipment was fast , no breaking or damage this is one of those 'more bang for your buck' deals worth it ! . 
these english tea biscuits are baked by hand in ashbourne , derbyshire by artisan biscuits the cookies are essentially flavored shortbread with a very distinct taste of butter , honey , and almonds and an excellent texture at once crumbly and crispy with a nice buttery mouthfeel br br i was fortunate enough to run across them at jack 's 0 99 store \( 2 packages for 0 99 ! \) in three flavors honey almond , ginger lemon , and rosehip blackcurrant they were quite the hit and immediately became the subject of conversation br br the honey almond was universally loved a few people thought that the ginger was a bit too strong or else did n't like the floral taste of the rosehips but those were just personal preferences of people generally not fond of those flavors in each instance , i thought the flavor combinations were both well chosen and perfectly balanced br br overall , you could n't ask for better quality in a packaged cookie i only regret that the chocolate raspberry , coconut lime , and vanilla cream varieties were n't available to try as well very highly recommended br br ingredients br br wheat flour br butter 25 7 br sugar br honey 6 2 br nibbed almonds 1 1 br natural almond flavoring br emulsifier \( soya lecithin \) br raising agent \( sodium bicarbonate \) br br each 150g 5 3 oz package contains 18 cookies or 6 servings of 3 cookies br br nutrition per serving of 3 cookies br br calories 130 br calories from fat 50 br total fat 6g br saturated fat 4g br trans fat 0 2g br cholesterol 15mg br sodium 45mg br total carbohydrates 18g br dietary fiber less than 1g br sugars 6g br protein 1g . 
my greyhounds 7 and 8 years old \( both brood matrons \) loved this lip smacking food it has given them more energy and their coats are looking wonderful in fact when you open the bag the food smells like fruit and veg changing to annamaet grainless salcha , which is small kibbles , from the old food does take a gradual process for the older dogs not because of its size , but because of its high quality lastly the company has never had a recall on its products , something we all look for today . 
we lived in charleston for years and always loved the availability of fresh seafood especially oysters ! now we live about 24 hours away and i do miss being able to swing by the seafood market when i'm in the mood i had no idea that i could have it delivered to my doorstep within a couple of days ! it was well packed and smelled as fresh as if we bought it off the boat impress your friends and throw together an oyster pasta dish so much better than the stuff in the small plastic containers at the grocery store ! these were huge . 
perfect starter tree it is adorable and the included manual tells you the basics of bonsai i bought this for my mother in law for mother 's day , a live tree instead of cut flowers makes a great gift . 
i bought this for my boyfriend as a valentines day gift and he absolutely loved it ! its an amazing size and includes all the essentials for a starter kit it arrived extremely quickly even though i chose standard shipping it arrived in a medium sized box and alot of packing peanuts which kept the tree stable and safe throughout shipping overall , i will definitely chose to order from joebonsai again because i was satisfied and absolutely love it ! . 
i received my tree quite quickly despite the holidays when i got the tree , it was packaged very well and i do n't think anything short of getting run over by a freight train could have broken the tree i called after i got the tree and the exchange i had with the person on the other end was very helpful , and i could not be more pleased with their service these guys show great care and dedication to the customers br br all in all , a fantastic buy . 
as far as noodles in a cup goes this is one of the best i 've had actual recognizable small chunks of dehydrated veggies , mostly mushrooms and onions that i could make out descent noodle quality and a very hot and spicy seasoning mix they do n't show it on the picture here but i'm pretty sure this is the hot and spicy cup it looks exactly like the one i just had but the words 'hot and spicy' are just to the left of the symbol and are not visible in the pic if you like spicy noodles definitely do n't pass this up br br very good . 
i used to eat nong shim shin noodle ramyun for years and that remains my favorite , however it has beef stock in it and i ca n't eat it anymore i checked out the whole nong shim line at my grocer for a vegetarian noodle and this cup is all i could find it tastes virtually identical to the bowl but is vegetarian its spicy , and the noodle is of a better quality than the 20 cent maruchan packages i grew up on you cant go wrong with nong shim but i thought that vegetarians should know about this soup br br so i just read on the description that it contains beef but the cup that is in my hands right now does not say that i may post a picture as proof . 
i really enjoy this noodle cup mostly because of the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the soup the noodles taste firmer and less like the cheap kind that would regularly come out of one of these instant noodle packages the flavoring has just the right amount of spice and is not excessively spicy . 
i pass around favorable endorsements very seldom but this is one of those occasions br br i'm almost 69 and this bacon would be as almost identical to the bacon i ate if it were a bit saltier and had the rind left on br br if you want the old time southern bacon without all the salt and the rind , this is it br br i 'll admit i do salt the bacon just a tad before i fry it br br this is good stuff if you appreciate great bacon . 
this ghirardelli mint dark chocolate tastes really good the chocolate is n't too sweet nor too bitter it is also not too creamy or milky as far as the mint filling , it adds some more sweetness to the chocolate , but at the same time the mint is very refreshing perfect to have after dinner or as a dessert br br if you like mint chocolate , you might also want to try the after eight mint chocolate they are very good too also try the ghirardelli peppermint bark chocolate which is kind of interesting taste \( a combination of chocolate dark chocolate with white chocolate and peppermint crust \) br br sidarta tanu . 
both my friend and i love this product the dark chocolate and the mint really supplement each other a little expensive but excellent quality . 
my mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven they did n't believe they deserved receiving these , but i know they did deserve to receive these ! . 
edit upgraded to 5 star they appear to have changed the recipe , as the last couple containers i have acquired have tasted substantially better ! it almost tastes like swiss miss cocoa \( and while swiss miss is not really my idea of great cocoa , for a protein drink mixed with water , that is pretty good ! \) br br summary this is the best non whey , non soy protein i have found , and i would highly recommend it to anyone with soy whey dairy sensitivities ! i rated this 4 stars , but if you ca n't have whey , it is definitely a 5 star product br br i'm allergic to both whey and soy , which has made finding a good protein supplement quite a pain ! i have tried pretty much everything on the market , including a variety of wheat , buckwheat , and brown rice proteins if you are looking for the highest quality protein available , you are unfortunately limited to egg , soy , whey , or casein \( based upon pdcaas , the fda and fao who 's method of determining protein quality \) , so egg is really preferable to the alternatives fortunately , this is , in terms of consistency , digestibility , and nutritive content \( 0 fat 0 carbs \) , and overall flavor , the best of the various proteins i tried in case you are wondering , there is no cholesterol in this protein , either texture and overall 'drinkability' are great i drink it mixed with water with no issues flavor is decent obviously , none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor extravaganza this protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate \( not as good as most whey casein proteins , but better than almost all non whey proteins i tried quite a few of those as well before discovering that i could not tolerate dairy proteins \) be warned the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible in my opinion , it is barely drinkable br br four stars overall if i had no food sensitivities , i might still use this in conjunction with whey protein , but would probably not use it exclusively br five stars if you ca n't have whey protein ! br br i hope that this review is helpful ! . 
i found this to be a good alternative to whey based protein powder i have only used this product for 30 days and am reordering before i get into my review , i might mention that i never thought of myself as whey or lactose intolerant , but after 3 months of taking quality whey protein i knew that what i was experiencing was not typical \( i'm talking about bathroom habits including frequency and consistency \) i asked a few older guys in the gym what there experience was with whey , most if not all where fine with it and experienced no problems or side effects one natural bb that is about my age late 30 's suggested this egg based protein product and noted that one of his training customers found it to be an acceptable alternative to the milk based protein products br br i did some research and to be honest the manufactures web site for behealthynfit is totally useless and outdated with little or no useful information their poor web site almost made me not buy this product it sure did n't invoke any consumer confidence and in my opinion is totally unacceptable br br how does it taste \? i bought the chocolate \( i'm not a chocolate lover but i think chocolate flavoring is the best option for protein powders \) the flavor is chocolate but its defiantly not a rich milk chocolate and it would n't fall in the same category as a dessert more of a taste that you can get used to i have also seen this flavor described as chocolate with a hint metallic i 'd agree with that it has an after taste that some may find metallic br br how does it mix \? i mix this with water directly in a 16oz ready to drink water bottle i drink 1 or 2 ounces , usually down to the top of the label then i place a funnel in the top and dump in one scoop usually i will need to shake or tap the funnel to get the powder to pass through then i screw the top on and shake well i have found that if the water is very cold the powder will clump more often and mix poorly room temperature water or water that is cool but not ice cold works best i use a wine fridge to keep the water at 50 \( i do n't like clumps \) note the consistency is exactly like water , if your expecting this to be a thick or heavy drink then will be disappointed br br i found that if you live in a humid state like florida you will need to make sure that you screw the lid to the protein power on tight if you expose this power to high humidity you will have a terrible time with it clumping and mixing properly br br general tips for drinking protein drinks i have found that eating a granola bar while drinking a protein drink helps first biting the granola bar then taking a drink i found this to work for me and it makes the occasional protein clump less noticeable br br is there room for improvement \? yes , loads of room for improvement is there anything better \? i have n't found it yet but i am still looking i will give this high marks until i find something better please leave a comment if you find a better non whey protein product . 
good taste mixes easy and has no artifical sweetners i been using this one for years . 
if you are concerned about digesting dairy and soy products you can rest assured that this is the protein for you it 's a nice vanilla flavor with no chalkiness and no artificial sweeteners i love it and i know my body loves it no digestion problems , ever rock on . 
this product has 24g of protein per serving and is ideal for getting lean because it has only about 110 calories and practically no fat the taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable if you need a pure bulk , as fast as you can , i recommend cyto gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people , including myself br br there 's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain weight loss and the jury seems to still be out however , what i can say for sure \( because doctors and nutritionists have told me \) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term also , the ideal ratio for carbos fat protein varies by body type and desired goal , the best way to learn is through trial and error personally , a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me , but that 's only ideal for the short term br br i definitely recommend this product for either people who ca n't take whey or for those wanting to get lean pure egg is a purely brilliant idea . 
i have been using this protein powder for about a month the first thing i noticed is that this brand mixes better than optimum nutrition egg protein , but still not like whey or even rice protein the texture is not great by itself in my opinion not awful but not great i have been mixing garden of eating super seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture i 've also tried blending the two with ice to make a smoothy which turned out ok for those of us who ca n't tolerate the whey or soy proteins , this particular brand is the best i 've found . 
i 've been a fan of hnf 's egg protein for a while now as whey bloats me and gives me indigestion \( that being said , the only whey i 've found that does n't bother my stomach at all is a href http www amazon com gp product b004botgtm optimum nutrition 100 platinum hydro whey turbo chocolate 1 75 protein a \) br br the chocolate tastes pretty good with water \( although i do n't really care about taste \) , and is actually pretty darn good with rice milk it also tastes good in smoothies \( i use frozen bananas and rice milk \) br br only downside is you may get gas initially and you 're going to smell things that no human should smell this passes pretty quickly \( huhuh \) though br br oh and do n't buy the vanilla flavored powder because it tastes like soap i use it in smoothies and it lends a little vanilla flavor but it 's still not very good . 
compared to other egg proteins i have recently used , this one is very sweet it is sweetened with splenda , so still very low in actual sugar carbs i prefer to use an unsweetened version and put fruit in the blender with it to naturally sweeten it , but my wife likes this one b c its easy to instantize in milk \( we use almond milk \) with a spoon no blender required . 
in general , egg protein does n't have the best taste since it has a mild flavor , mixing with other ingredients \( e g bananas \) work well . 
i really like this protein drink i'm pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat this is the perfect solution i usually mix it with a combination of 1 2 plain almond milk and half water i also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions , otherwise i find it too sweet the nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie filled sugar of some sort i prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often gmo and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy \( or for anyone actually \) , and whey protein is a dairy product , which i generally do n't tolerate well egg protein is perfect for my needs . 
in my opinion , this is the best protein powder out there br i 've used a lot of different protein products , from dymatize to optimum nutrition \( gold standard \) and celltech \( muscletech \) , bsn , many others as well the reason that i tried this one is because i 've been doing a lot of research , talking with my doctor and nutritionists regarding the subject of protein and protein suppliments in general the conclusion that i have come to is that the whey products are ok , but they are not the magic dust that everyone thinks it is sure it is good , and the protein is not bad , but it can be better br for those who have issues with dairy , whey is not an option whey is a dairy product , and actually a bi product of diary production dairy is not the best choice of protein out there , many may disagree with this but it is a fact america has an infatuation with dairy and sweets if you look at any tables that show protein absorbtion effeciency in our bodies you will see this fact eggs and fish are rated at the top for best absorbtion and usage in the human body eggs are around 88 effeciency , while fish is around 70 and chicken around 60 whey and dairy are below all of these , this is precisely why whey is so cheap , and that is why it is so popular sure the egg protein is going to be more expensive , but it is a better product br as far as taste and texture , i find it just as good as the whey products that i have used , and even better then some i 've tried some whey powders that were just aweful i have a 5lb tub of metabolic whey that i tried , it is still sitting in the back room . 
the healthy 'n fit egg protein is a very good product it 's almost all protein , the taste is good , you can cook with it \( my favorites are oatmeal and russian style cottage cheese pancakes \) and the price used to be great , even cheaper per ounce than the a href http www amazon com gp product b000gist86 optimum nutrition 100 egg protein , rich chocolate , 2 pound a however , since i bought my first tub earlier this year , the price jumped significantly to more than the optimum nutrition chocolate flavored egg protein , so i bought a 2 lb tub of that i found that while the on protein has a little fat and more carbs in it , it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps , unlike the healthy 'n fit product i also like the taste just fine so i found that i enjoy my shakes with the on more , and it 's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the on br br please do n't get me wrong this is a great product but i just do n't think it warrants a higher price than the optimum nutrition protein br br so , to recap , as compared to a href http www amazon com gp product b000gist86 optimum nutrition 100 egg protein , rich chocolate , 2 pound a br pros br lower in carbs br lower in fat br br cons br more expensive br clumpier harder to mix . 
i 've tried a number of protein powders over the years most problems i encountered ranged from poor taste , to not mixing well , to leaving me bloated the healthy n fit egg protein is only 100 calories and you get 24 grams of protein with no cholesterol , no fat , no carbs , minimal sodium \( in the big scheme of things \) and even some potassium add to that the fact that it mixes really well and tastes good either on it 's own or mixed with fruit i do n't feel bloated with this at all like i did with other products like muscle milk light i usually throw a banana and some blueberries into a blender with one serving of the protein for breakfast and then i use it straight right after a good workout again , it tastes great on it 's own or mixed with fruit i strongly recommend this product . 
having a lactose intolerance , i 've tried multiple egg proteins as well as some whey isolate proteins as well this is hands down the best tasting protein powder out there vanilla and chocolate are both delicious \( i would stay away from strawberry , it has a strange artificial taste to it , this was the updated formula too so they still have n't worked it out \) i prefer to mix with some vanilla coconut milk and it 's actually something i look forward to drinking \( as opposed to some that i had just choked down as quickly as i could \) i have also mixed in a teaspoon of cinnamon with just water and the vanilla protein and it is good as well br br another plus is that it uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners such as sucralose or aspartame br br if you ca n't handle whey casein protein then i would absolutely recommend this one \( even if you can but want to try something else \) best bang for your buck compared to other egg proteins and the taste is actually good . 
i like this product , and i agree with any post , who says it mixes well , i bought a sample case just to test the waters , and i dont feel bloated or anything after i drink it , i think i feel my body is responding to it very well , i am going to finish up the muscle milk protein because i bought it and i pay over 30 for it , lol , but when i finish up the other proteins i purchase , i am going to stick with egg white protein , since i dont like eating them , everyone taste buds is different , some may like it , some may dont , then depending on your body chemistry some responds well to egg whites , some dont , but as for me personally i like it so far , might try out the strawberry passion protein , but the vanilla kind taste very good , i would suggest this protein should be used for edurance athletes , or people who are into calistenics such as push ups and pull ups , . 
this egg protein is great ! br first off , it is sweetened with stevia , a natural herb , and not some artificial sweetener like aspartame or sucralose br next , it is very easy on the stomach , even whey without lactose is a lot harder on my digestion system it seems br it tastes good , mixes well , and is a good value br i bought all 3 flavors and found i prefer the vanilla br goes really well with some almond milk and blueberries br i'm glad i 've found a pure protein source that is dairy and soy free . 
i loved vitalabs egg protein , but i think their out of business this healthy n fit will substitute just fine , . 
excellent product great taste and easy to sue in cereal , yougur etc that 's it in a nutshell very timely delivery . 
fantastic product keeps fresh for months had a bag in my desk that i had opened but packet was resealed , product still fresh after several weeks product has a spicy but not hot flavor and is enjoyed by my whole family i am diabetic and have a hard time finding low sodium , low calorie snacks grandpa po 's products are both low sodium , low calorie and also taste great i would highly recommend . 
grandpa po 's originals slightly spicy is a wonderful savory organic snack not too spicy at first and ends with a great finish if i had to sum it up in one word it would be wow ! i would recommend them for young and old alike . 
for years i have grown my own habaneros to dry , crush and use for cooking i have been unable to do so for the last two years because of a job relocation my supply from previous years had run out so i purchased this product to re supply br br i have been tremendously satisfied great quality , great consistency , great heat , good color , good particulate size , good price br br without any reservation would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for a good habanero powder br br be warned though it is not for the faint of heart . 
initially i was worried about loss of potency when thinking about a powdered pepper this came out beautiful though ! it is very finely ground , much like cayenne pepper is commonly found the color is beautiful br br i am very happy with this habanero powder ! i am so glad angelina 's gourmet was there to provide such a wonderful product , and ship it out so fast ! if you want some habanero for spicing up your food , buy this ! it is great ! . 
hot full of lavor great for jerky sauces love it . 
been buying ground habanero from american spice for years , decided to try someone else with their price going up up up , and not satisfied with consistency of heat this stuff had the right flavor and more heat than anything beside fresh , it will make you sweat better price and value than any habanero experience in 20 years of buying the stuff , will buy from this vendor again . 
the product was better than expected and it arrived quickly i am very pleased with this purchase . 
i love hot foods , and love this product , but it is dangerous ! i have dogs , and the air born powder travels in the air fast and hard ! their eyes were watering , from five feet across the room at my first serving br br i had n't even opened the container , i only unwrapped it out of the mailer box , touched the outside of the bottle and rubbed my eyes and wow ! h o t ! i thought about smelling it , and am glad i did n't it would have burned the inside of my nose majorly br br i decided to take out a small portion , and move it into an old spice jar with a sprinkle top to control the amount i am serving on my meals the larger bottle , is to big to work with such a a hot product i needed more control on what i was eating if you decide to do this , make sure that you do it in a sink , then wash the sink out , and do not breathe when you are doing the transfer , or better yet use a mask i made a paper funnel , and when it was traveling from the larger bottle to the smaller bottle , it when into my nose , and i had a five minute sneeze attack \( in fact , every time i use it i do \) i stored the larger bottle in a plastic bag , until i need to refill , and plan to wash the outside of the smaller bottle after each use , so no one else in the house gets hurt br br households with pets and teenagers please watch out for your sneaky animals , that try to swipe your food off your table , it could hurt them and send them to the vet and watch out for teenagers with a bad sense of humor , it could hurt someone badly if they decide to play a joke on someone with this pepper seriously br br also , i guess i really am bad a math this size will last me a lifetime ! it is a very great tasting pepper , smoky flavored , if you can get past the hot part ! . 
i have previously brought habanero powder from a gourmet store at the grove in la it was roughly 3 oz for 5 95 this has the same great flavor and intensity that a habanero powder should have we use it to season fried fish and chicken and all braised meat dishes i highly recommend buying this product . 
who knew that when i bought this 4 years ago that i was also getting something good for my health saw a recent dr oz show with andrew weil and he had a great puttanesca recipe and one of the ingredients was dried red pepper by the way the recipe is just as good without the tuna i sprinkle a little of my habanero powder as a substitute for the red pepper flakes br br you do n't need much of the powder it is very good quality , if you see it you probably used to much i put some of the powder on almost anything the best part \? i had no idea i was buying a life time supply , after 4 years i think i have barely used a tenth , my family makes a little fun of me about that but i do n't mind , i love it , the powder and the humor very highly recommended . 
i especially like like this on a href http www amazon com gp product b0052onatm lydia 's organics , kale krunchies , mega green , 3 oz \( 85 g \) a i empty the kale into a container , sprinkle on habanero powder , put a lid on it , and then turn it over and over to mix the two wow i 've heard it 's great with popcorn , too whatever you do , just be careful how much powder you use i 've been in a world of spicey hurt more than once \) . 
this stuff is the bomb br there is no pepper that has a tastier fruity flavor than the habanero the fact that is fiery hot is both a bonus , \( for us heat lovers \) and a curse \( for the wussies \) br i use this stuff all the time sprinkle it on a sandwich over the tomato , sprinkle it over some mexican sour cream for a dip sprinkle on pizza or a cucumber and tomato salad the uses are near endless br br also if you wanted to use it in lieu of mace or pepper spray , a little bit of this stuff blown onto any skin location rapidly induces excitement br be careful in the sprinkling of this stuff , if you get a smal puff of it into your nose , you will most definately know about it p . 
this stuff is gold for the hot spicy food enthusiast i put it on most everything other than breakfast \( grape nuts \) i really think you get way more value from this than any hot sauce in a bottle this is basically what is in that fancy bottle hot sauce , just without a fancy label try it 16oz goes a long way ! . 
my mom was born in manchester , england , and i have been drinking tea since i was very young a few years ago i was forced to switch to decaf tea most of the blends available are terrible i used to drink regular yorkshire tea , and was thrilled to discover they had a decaf blend and it is a strong , full bodied tea , and i love it ! i decided to purchase from amazon because i knew i could count on them , as well as their outside vendors i was very pleased with the transaction and would purchase from them again . 
i just received my tea thanks for getting it out so quick i really appreciate the extra box i drink this tea every night br br julianne . 
i have used this product for over twenty years however , it is br br no longer available in any of the local food markets in the br br los angeles , ca area i'm happy that i can order it via br br amazon com . 
i ordered this candy for a friend as a mother 's day gift she was delighted to receive it and i was excited to share it \) . 
i was swayed to try this thanks to amazon 's new add on program cod roe pasta is surprisingly good , especially with the toasted nori ! i used 100 grams of angel hair pasta with one packet of the sauce next time , i may reduce the amount of pasta , or use two packets of sauce , to up the flavor a dash of red pepper might be good , too . 
i am glad nail deco has become to be adult deco and not just for little girls i am not sure why it started out for adults and dove downward for little chicks and now back up to where it is alright for all sizes of females you can also use items from junkyards , wooden catalogs , and other places not usually on the same channel as beauty materials for jewelry and accessories . 
this is not as tall as they advertised but we kept it and we like it alot it is the shining star of our indoor bonsai collection just stunning like having a forest in your kitchen ! we 've had it about 6 months now and it 's thriving . 
one of the few chicken jerky type treats out there that 's made in the usa \( connecticut \) and is n't made in china time and time again there are recalls for these types of treats that come from china do not buy treats made in china for your pets ! sure , these are a tad more expensive , but in the long run it will save you money by not having vet bills and save the health of your pet ! i call it kitty and dog candy ! they come running from any room in the house when they hear the bag open they love bravo 's real meat treats ! . 
my cat is a picky eater , but he got excited even before the bag was open \( i guess he smelled the meat \) and devours the treats the only downside is the size i understand this was a strip , but i use them as regular bite size treats and therefore had to break them into bits by hand \( took me a while \) i wish amazon sold bite size roast chicken treats by this company i feel good about giving them to the cat , as it seems most cat treats are loaded with bad stuff . 
they have other flavors but the dogs favorite is still the original i wish they carried it in the local petstore we go to purchase their other flavors ! . 
we love this sauce and are hunting around to find it and to introduce it to others sort of a wasabi mayonnaise and terrific on fish , potatoes , and many other things \( we 're eager to discover more \) . 
was quite pleased with the product arrived on time and wrapped well would buy again and again ! ! ! ! ! try it , you 'll let it ! ! ! ! ! . 
the service was excellent , and the patty shells were delicious it 's hard to find those things in grocery stores or bakeries , and being able to order them on line is a real help . 
i bought these for my husband because he occassionally likes a cup of coffee at home and it is a hassle to drag out the coffee maker and grinder when he only wants one cup and it 's not everyday it also comes in handy when guests come over , because we do n't tend to keep coffee in the house br br each serving comes in a little pouch that you can easily slip into your pocket , briefcase or travel bag the flavor was rich and at around 1 00 a cup , much cheaper than going to starbucks or anywhere else and grabbing a cup on the way to work br br it dissolves completely leaving no grit or residue he first tried it in a 12 ounce mug and found it to be a little strong , but was perfect in his 20 ounce travel mug br br . 
i was absolutely amazed at how good this is in my opinion , it is as good as fresh ground coffee beans brewed up while i only use when i'm in a hurry , or want one cup , i would not be without it \( and i have never used instant before now . 
i 've been a fan of starbucks via since it was first introduced as a pregnant \( and now breastfeeding \) woman , my caffeine intact is restricted to one cup of coffee a day i'm lazy and not willing to go to the trouble to make a pot of coffee for just one cup , so i switched to via i do n't think i 'll ever go back i 've tried all the via varieties , including the decaf italian roast and the various flavor blends \( mocha , vanilla , etc \) this columbia variety is one of my favorites it 's not as bold as the italian or french roast varieties , but it has a smoother and mellower taste and will appeal to those who like a well balanced cup of coffee good work , starbucks , and keep the new varieties coming ! . 
unlike most people , i prefer not a weak coffee but a milder roast than the burnt stuff most coffee houses make that requires many accoutrements to mask like cream , sugar and artificial flavors therefore , i purposely only tried the columbian br br i work in a place that has poorly serviced coffee dispensing machines they are fun in that you never know what will come out in a day to day basis some time just your coins back a few people have illicit electric coffee pots , others use a french press , and still others sneak out for the real thing br br now that i discovered the columbian via i have to defend my cup from all those noses that circle my cup i know there are directions on the pack however , i now have my own ritual clean cup , fill 2 3rds filtered water 90 seconds in the microwave shake contents to bottom of pack rip the whole top off the pack with teeth pour pack in coup and watch sizzle stir for a few seconds add a tad of ice hope i can make it back to my desk before the cup empties br br i was never a fan of reconstituted coffee however i think it is the addition of the micro ground coffee that adds the edge necessary br br in any event you owe it to yourself to try it . 
i am a self proclaimed coffee guy i enjoy chatting about coffee with the manager of my local starbucks i also have my own burr grinder , french press , espresso maker and 2 drip coffee makers \( 2 cup and 12 cup \) so where does via fit into my coffee life \? i typically use a via packet when i want a quick cup of coffee and do n't want to take the time or effort to brew a pot \( 12 cup or 2 cup coffee makes \) br pros br fast and convenient br taste great for an instant coffee it is not quite as good as fresh brewed but remarkably better than other instant coffee br cons br it is expensive so watch the price on amazon it will vary greatly over time i tell my wife we are not pay the full price people put the item in your cart and then if u have time check your cart daily for a while \( i do this for all amazon purchases since the price does really fluctuate for most items \) for via i have found that watching it can save me 50 or more on amazon the price of this item locally never changes much br it is not the same as good brewed coffee do n't expect this to be the same as fresh brewed coffee all else constant \( i e filtered water etc \) . 
as far as instant coffees go , this one is amazingly good usually , i have to use sugar with instant coffee , as they generally taste really bitter not so with this one i can drink it straight and it tastes like real coffee br br while this will never fully replace brewed starbucks coffee for me , it is still pretty good and i will be keeping it my desk at work . 
this is not a coffee that i would drink on a regular basis my morning coffee is freshly ground however , at work i occasionally want a cup in the afternoon and the folgers and maxwell house that my coworkers brew is undrinkable the price on this coffee is a bit high but the taste is better than any other instant coffee i 've tried so i 'll keep getting it until i find something better and cheaper . 
while no instant coffee will ever taste as good as a freshly ground then brewed cup with filtered or spring water , this is as good as it gets otherwise while pricey , the packets are handy and convenient , the directions are easy \( just add 8 oz of hot water and stir \) , and the taste is smooth i even got a bit of a caffeine buzz these instant blends are not as bold or strong as getting a regular cup of columbian or italian roast at a starbucks location , but still a very good cup on the go i really like this instant coffee and will continue to purchase them . 
i use it when traveling or when i'm in a hurry and do n't have the time to grind my beans i was surprised by how much it tastes like drip . 
i love this coffee it is easy to prepare one cup when you are wanting a great cup of coffee highly recommend i usually use one half of the package since i do n't like my coffee real strong . 
i like this coffee it 's much better than instant i keep some packs in my desk for those long afternoons and i also started carrying them when i go camping if i can go wthout another cup of instant coffee from a jar , i 'll be happy . 
you know , this stuff is really amazing you can actually create a fresh brewed cup of starbucks coffee in your own home for less than half the price of store bought the quality of the coffee is very high , and the taste is almost an exact replica of the real thing they have really done a great job with this product br br when i first saw it on the shelves , i thought , starbucks instant for over a 1 00 a serving \? yeah , right ! but i decided to try it anyway , and what do you know \? it really tastes great you really cannot tell much of a difference , \( i suppose you could if you had them both side by side , \) but the reality is this once you load down your coffee with foam , cream , flavoring and whatnot , and you let it cool off a bit , the two are almost identical very , very little meaningful difference br br so , i can make myself a tasty cup of starbucks at my own home , with my own cup , anytime i want it saves me from having to go down to starbucks and spend almost 1 more the quality and flavor are good , and the price is actually right br br i recommend . 
i am not a big fan of starbucks coffee but i have to say this istant one tastes the same as their house coffee they brew so , that puts it on the highest shelf within instant coffee family by far it also has the br kick of a regular brewed coffee due to the microgranuls of real coffee beans in it must have if you are on the go or have no coffee maker near you . 
prepared as directed w 8oz of water it is very strong good tasting coffee , not better than fresh colombian , but very good for emergencies and to have on hand for some this might be strong so 10oz of water is more the kind my friends like a good colombian coffee on the go but i like my fresh ground and brewed stuff better i give them an a for effort , finally someone is getting close to that point where i ca n't tell it is n't fresh brewed but not quite there yet i ordered it 2 days ago and got it fast , the best by date on mine is may 20th of this year 2011 , rather quick to expire or this stock is old \? perhaps that is why it tastes instant \? . 
this is a great stand in when you ca n't make it out to starbucks love having an instant version at home love , love , love it . 
i rarely drink instant coffee , but sometimes go to rural india on medical trips outside of starbucks cafes and large western style hotels \( in all cities , but not in rural india \) it is nearly impossible to get brewed coffee in india ask for coffee , and you get instant , everywhere in india \( except as noted \) anyway , to get a coffee fix on the go , i 've tried the starbucks via columbia packets , and \( for instant coffee \) they are wonderful , wo n't fool you into thinking you 've got a good cup of brewed coffee , but better than common western office coffee , and much better than the instant served in rural india the starbucks packs cost 75 cents to 1 each , and i was hoping the nescafe clasico packs would be nearly as good , at 1 8 the price unfortunately , not if you want something that reminds you of brewed coffee , bite the bullet and pay for the starbucks . 
i bought this as an experiment to try on a camping trip br after adding hot water , there was a brief 'instant coffee' taste but that was soon gone and i was left with a real good cup of coffee it 's too expensive for my budget as a regular item , but i 'll definitely include it on future camping trips , and driving trips with stays at cheap motels . 
if you want a good cup of coffee and are rushed for time or your household is like mine and you are the only coffee drinker , then you must give this a try i admit the price is a little high but for that occasional cup it is well worth it no bitter after taste like other instants . 
i tried the starbucks instant coffee not only does it taste like coffee but there is no after taste like you get with other instant coffees i give this 2 thumbs up ! ! ! ! . 
starbucks has once again proven it is the world 's best coffee company their new via instant coffee packets taste great and are portable which gets me through the day i highly recommend this to anyone who loves starbuck 's coffee ! ! . 
starbucks via will not replace a well crafted hand brewed cup of coffee from your favorite coffee shop , but it 's a hell of a lot better than what you probably expect instant coffee to taste like br br if your experience with instant coffee stops at taster 's choice or folgers , be prepared to be wowed those products produce a result that tastes and looks like water with some coffee flavoring starbucks via is much more like a real cup of coffee br br another advantage of via is that the packets are soluble in cold or tepid water , so it 's possible to mix yourself a glass of iced coffee right away , rather than having to brew and then cool coffee first br br at about 1 per cup , it 's certainly less expensive than fresh brewed starbucks coffee , though it 's still more expensive than brewing coffee at home using a drip maker , french press or whatever other process you prefer but for when you 're on the run or on the road , it 's quite a serviceable and enjoyable cup of coffee without too much muss and fuss i bring via packets with me when i travel , for example , and keep them on hand for when i'm not in the mood or do n't have the time to brew a whole pot . 
i drink starbucks drip coffee the instant tastes just as good , and is great when you do n't want to make a whole pot friends could not believe they were drinking instant coffee . 
without reservation , this is the best instant coffee i have ever tasted i have consumed coffee in many different countries during over 40 years of travel starbucks has created a masterpiece with this product it is a bit expensive , but well worth the cost . 
after a slow start at our meeting of guests embracing these coffee packets , everyone ended up enjoying them . 
really very good taste is great , no weird artificial taste , no little bitty grounds floating about this is not crunchy brown water , but an actual cup of coffee i make it in the microwave and it 's great get the 10 pack for 9 95 and it 's less than 1 cup . 
great coffee for the one cup drinker , or the traveler especially great for travel where you have to pack it in your suit cases wonderful for overseas where us style coffees are hard to be found taste is very good . 
it really is great instant at very first sip , i thought i detected that instant aftertaste , but as i continued , i was more impressed i drink coffee black , and am pretty particular about my java i do think this is a great product to take on the road , to work , etc could do without the starbucks priceyness , though . 
i am a very picky coffee drinker i was so surprised at the flavor of the italian roast 8oz to 10oz of water is all you need i run the water through the one cup coffer maker it 's important to put the coffee in first and stir while hot water is coming through i guess you could just micro the water and pour it over the coffee in another mug great for home or travel we all know hotel coffee is terrilbe br llhb enjoy ! . 
behind the 12 packets of via instant coffee , starbucks placed a brief message , never be without that 's a better marketing strategy than , say , you could do worse instant coffee is still instant coffee and no one who starts his or her day with a cup of joe is about to trade fresh brew or french press for instant br br in a pinch , via is a portable and affordable option br br however , i do n't recommend via as a strategy to save money on your coffee bill a quality coffee press and a thermos will do much better the 12 packet order currently sells for 8 95 on amazon , without special offers or subscribe and save discounts that works out to 0 75 per cup , which is about what you 'd expect to pay in a standard vending machine hands down , starbucks via tastes better than anything pouring out of a vending machine however , each via stick produces an 8 ounce cup of coffee so , depending which size you normally order , you might spend 1 50 \( for 16 ounces \) or 2 25 \( for 24 ounces \) br br at 0 75 per 8 ounce cup , starbucks' via sticks are the same price as solobrew 's a href http www amazon com gp product b002qtj70m french press to go solopress a , which i also reviewed on amazon com i still recommend both brands as tasty and portable options over the ubiquitous , freeze dried coffee sold in glass jars br br rating four stars . 
sell me more ! these things are the perfect breakfast no , they are just perfect better price then the local grocery store and better selection . 
sometimes i just want something hot for breakfast , but do n't want to cook anything this oatmeal pack is great and has my favorite flavors br br recommend it with milk with water is just too weak . 
all of these flavors are great and make for a filling and delicious breakfast i highly recommend purchasing this item ! . 
this is definitely a great snack or morning breakfast br br i tried all the flavors and they were as expected great br br if you want a good healthier snack or meal this is the way to go ! ! ! . 
ca n't find this product anywhere locally thanks amazon ! much cheaper than 4 boxes of quaker oatmeal anywhere , and these flavors are the best \) . 
my kids have eaten oatmeal everyday since the weather turned cold it puts warmth and filling breakfast into their tummies these flavors were great , they loved them ! i wish there had been more apple and less banana br br the subscription meant we always had oatmeal , and it meant a lower price too ! so convenient now that winter is ending , i just cancelled the subscription and done ! . 
are you sick of the regular flavors \? plain , apples and cinnamon , brown sugar br br yeah me too this really changes oatmeal up at least for me it did i have been eating oatmeal for some time and saw these flavors and figured how could i lose these new flavors are fantastic and i ca n't recommend them enough if you think their too strong you could always mix two packets like me and use a plain with one of these i do n't generally do that but i like to use up the plain packets i usually have left over from the other assortments i get . 
this particular variety box contains 3 of my very favorite types of instant oatmeal apple crisp , cinnamon roll banana bread . 
this is a great marinade for any kind of meat i use it also in stir fry or fried rice receipes a href http www amazon com gp product b004tgwcbq garlic sesame marinade glaze sauce a . 
i had this cheese during the summer on a hiking trip through the french alps we were able to go to a small producer and watch its preparation it is really delicious , better than gruyere , to which it is often compared when oh when can i get it in the u s \? . 
we love jamaican me crazy coffee ! ! ! it 's smooth and rich with a hint of vanilla and caramel this is whole bean , so you do have to have a coffee grinder , but totally worth it ! . 
this stuff really works , i love it and cant get enough it tastes amazing highly recommend trying it , you wont be disappointed ! ! . 
the drink has a pleasant taste , especially when very cold within 20 30 minutes i do feel more relaxed , and my mind stops racing i am a nurse , and sometimes after a crazy 12 hour shift , it is hard to turn my brain off and sleep i keep replaying situations in my mind , and have a hard time relaxing this drink helps quiet my thoughts enough that i can fall asleep the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is because i usually have to get up in the night to use the bathroom after drinking a 12 oz drink before bed i do fall right back to sleep though , so i do n't feel like my sleep is interrupted will definitely keep this in the fridge for the end of a hectic day i love that it is sweetened with splenda and not nutrasweet also , it is a nice calorie free alternative to wine or beer for that end of day night cap ! . 
i do n't drink soda and have no interest in energy drinks i love coffee however , i enjoy chamomile tea before bed this calming beverage is a great alternative to tea especially in hot weather i will be ordering more wish it were available locally . 
i have a very hectic lifestyle and need time to relax i have always had trouble sleeping as my head is spinning i have tried lots of methods to try and sleep well but nothing has worked i saw this product in my local walmart and thought , what the heck , i 'll try it br br wow , why could they not have brought this product out years ago after about 20 minutes my mind was able to let go and relax and i had the best nights sleep in a long time the taste is awesome and it does not feel overwhelming like other products br br i am ordering more to stock up my fridge , just great ! ! . 
my wife and i ordered 12 cans of the sugar free koma unwind i must admit i was skeptical , but i thought i would give it a try boy , was i amazed by the refreshing flavor , but more importantly how i felt about 20 minutes or so after drinking a can of koma unwind i slept like a baby i just placed another order today for more i plan to give some to my friends who have trouble sleeping what a great concept by koma i will be a customer for life . 
i was skeptical at first , but not anymore , did it 's job and i slept like a baby great taste and product works wonders , very relaxing . 
i love koma it tastes great , it works , and the sugar free version tastes exactly like the original \( to me \) i just ordered my third case . 
i was at a walmart in south carolina and just picked some up i was traveling and it helped me unwind . 
bought a case to see what it was about i am a night owl which effects my day to day performance and father related tasks after a can i do feel mellow and finding myself going to bed much earlier . 
after 20 30 minutes you do feel alot more relaxed , reminded my of smoking a certain item when i was younger tastes great to boot ! . 
this is a very good tea as far as teabags go traditionally loose tea is always better quality than teabag teas , but this is the exception being organic as well as the least processed compared to other teas \( white tea is the least processed of all teas \) teabags impart a subtle paper flavor that loose teas are free of these bags are a cut above other teabagged teas \( the subtle teabag flavor is less of a factor in this instance \) and are an excellent choice in leu of saving money it took about six weeks to finally get delivered , but it was worth the weight this one is a no brainer ! ! ! . 
after reading the other reviews , i'm confused and do n't think that anyone was talking about this tea ! \( sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea , and do n't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on that being said , this is a remarkable tea it 's delicious , it 's instant \( so you do n't have to wait for it to steep \) and it 's really good for you i just love the taste of this , but then again i enjoy the uniquely bitter flavor of dong quai \( but this is n't bitter , it 's yummy ! \) for those who do n't know , dong quai is considered to be ginseng for women beceause it 's very high in vit b12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic \( due the their monthly cycle \) it also is said to help regulate irregular periods , when used on a daily basis that said , this tea is special because it helps to draw one 's energy downwards \( and the red date , adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra \) in other words , this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed \( and it 's good for you and it tastes good and it 's a snap to make \) so what 's there to be quibbling about \? . 
my household has this tea stocked up at all times not to say it 's my favorite tea , but it 's my favorite day to day tea we tend to drink green tea for its health benefits and as green teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types a few notes you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea , it does n't have a whole lot of tolerance from crisp and delicious to overpowering and slightly off putting i guess i attribute that to the freshness of the tea i'm not sure i 've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas while this tastes good when you get it right , if you forget the cup for a few minutes , it 's not forgiving that said , that 's the only real drawback to this tea yes i 've had teas i would rate five stars , six if i could yes , they also cost 5 6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea bottom line , if you drink a lot of tea , this is a good brand to buy if you do n't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it , i 'd look elsewhere . 
this tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor the bags come individually wrapped in foil packets it steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic i love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so the one thing i think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags i am usually not a fan of stevia \( to me it has a bitter aftertaste \) but it was not overwhelming here . 
purchased this tea because of recommendation product arrived well packaged and quickly i am very pleased with this product and will purchase it again . 
i have tried this product before and i really love it the price is fair and i enjoy it . 
i am sensitive to caffeine and supposedly the white teas have 1 3 approx what black teas contain and about half of what the green teas contain this probably varies all over the place however often a decaf tea is n't if you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks i find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas my husband and i ca n't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it 's astringent properties but we temper that with milk or 100 cranberry juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered good both hot or iced looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the prince of peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable i hope they do n't up the price just because everyone else 's white tea is higher i wish it was available in a loose tea too a smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas i had as a child and at chinese restaurants beats anything i can buy in local supermarkets br br i did try the organic version and no way this one is better for some reason stronger and overall a better product even the bag it 'self is better than the organic 's . 
the tea is good and fresh we enjoy it the shipping is fast and cost is reasonable br i recommend this product . 
you get enough in each package to make a good size cup of drink it is consistent in its flavor and the amount you get in each packet i have purchased it a couple of times . 
if you do n't have the time to cut up ginger and boil it for it 's wonderful flavor here 's an alternative this tea is refreshing true ginger flavor and punch is wonderful . 
i have used fancy feast for years when i saw the marinated morsals come out , i tried them and no i only get the marinated morsels , by request of smoky \( my black cat \) br br he loves them and more than the other line br br if you cat is like smoky , where he much prefers cat food with gravy on it , so that he licks through it and gets his meat with it as well plus , if you cat likes the smaller morals of food , like my cat does , then your cat should really like the marinated morsals br br there have been times i have tried to switch to difference brands , but if the pieces of meat or fish are large for him , he will only lap up the gravy the marinated morsals are his favorite br br i keep waiting for my smok to start talking to me , so i can understand his food choices as well as his philosophy on life \) , but until then , smokey and the others cats that i have had , have seemed to communicate to me pretty darn well as what they want and have all trained me very well br br jon . 
my dughter used these , and loved the fresh taste of the tomatoes ! said it was like she had just picked them fron a garden ! . 
i love the fact that this is multi grain baby food but like people food , good for you things never taste great so mix it with bananas or some other fruit yes , the texture is a bit difficult to swallow for little ones , hence why you want to thin it out i read the other reviews and ca n't believe they never thought to mix this food with something else . 
we love this vegetable pouch for our 18 month old , and more importantly she likes it too i like that it has sort of a dry texture compared to basic blended vegetables i stir a touch of milk into it each time and it makes it really creamy she always finishes it , and its one of our favorites . 
my son has been eating the multi grain super greens with gusto from when he was 8 months old he likes it cold or warm yes , it 's quite plain tasting to our grown up palates but in my opinion great for the little ones i started putting some cracked pepper and herbs on it more recently sometimes , i serve it as a snack , sometimes as a side dish to meatballs or chicken highly recommended . 
it 's more of a side dish than a main dish cook in some chili beans and peppers then it 's more of a meal it also made a very good taco salad it was also good as burrito filling with some extra cheese this is a good starting point to let your imagination make good great the expiration date on mine was good for a year , well into 2008 . 
i made this last night for dinner it was very good i substituted the cheese topping they provide with real cheese and then used the casserole as burrito filling it made 14 burritos \( 8 inch \) , so it goes a long way br br if you like spicy stuff it is a little bland but that is expected with boxed meals on the other hand , if you do n't like spicy , then it is a little hot so that could go either way br br as a side note there is n't much meat in this so if you are wanting lots of hamburger , you would be better off with something else . 
of course , it 's a taste opinion i gave it four stars because it 's easy and quite edible probably three stars as just food br br wrap a tortilla around some or eat it plain , it makes an interesting and fairly good , filling meal i have no idea why somebody would toss it it just ai n't that bad , folks not the greatest din din in the world but not at all bad , either but then , if you hate chewing a taco , then you may not like it br br personally , i prefer the stroganoff and love the chicken and biscuits i 've ordered the alfredo , so we 'll see about that however , these are all easy meals for a decent price i'm a retired guy living along , so they 're great for me probably a nice idea for a college student or two for anyone , a nice package to have around for a busy day feeds two hungry folks , three normal folks a bit skimpy for four unless they 're dieting . 
have roasted and peeled chestnuts all my life since i have less time and energy now , i ordered these in a jar already peeled tried lots of different ones and found these to be the most tasteful and clean and fresh . 
this is one of two licorice mints that i would recommend they are indeed difficult to find and at this time \( 6 2011 \) amazon does not carry my other favorite , st claire 's nonetheless , meltzer 's has beneficial herbs and a mild but definite licorice flavor not one of the licorice flavored gummy candies two or three of these little hard pastilles , and you 're done no black tongue either ! treat yourself , and indulge in these little gems . 
the butterfinger has been around since it was introduced by the curtiss candy company of illinois in 1923 in the 1990s , they put a new wrinkle on the trademark by making butterfinger bbs those were good , but they really outdid themselves when they invented the butterfinger crisp ! the butterfinger crisp is made of baked wafers sandwiching layers of butterfinger flavored cream then , the whole thing is wrapped in chocolate br br yeah , this candy bar is great , a real improvement on the original it has that same great butterfinger taste , but without that stick to teeth consistency if anything it even tastes better ! the normal sized butterfinger crisp contains 210 calories , but a nice thing is that it comes in the form of two bars , which allows you to eat one as a \( roughly \) 100 calorie snack and save the other one for tomorrow 's snack i wish that they did that with other candy bars br br anyway , if you like butterfingers , or if you like wafer candy , then you will like butterfinger crisps go for it ! . 
butterfinger crips is so good its like eating a really fresh butterfinger i order online because i had a hard time finding them in the stores if you like butterfingers you will like butterfinger crisp a light candybar not to heavy on your stomach . 
all of my 3 girls from the black lab , akita , and pomeranian love these treats i love them because i can disguise any of the dogs meds in them , and they will still eat it ! ! great . 
all of us like to give treats to our pets , but some of them are just too high in fat or too calorie laden my dog was just diagnosed with diabetes , and our vet suggested we use these chicken bits as her treats instead of the normal milk bone type biscuits they are very low in fat and high in protein , very chewy and my dog just loves them i wish the treats were a bit larger for my lab , so i end up giving her two if you have a smaller dog , they also make these treats in a smaller size also these are just the right size to use as treats if you are training your dog . 
lean treats for big dogs is a great product and goldie loves them , and yes this was the best price and it was shipped on time tom \( 12 \) . 
my dog absolutely loves these treats ! he 's a very picky eater and this is the only treat he will eat the fact that they are pretty healthy makes me very happy . 
when a locale store started carrying wellness products , this was one of them i purchased a bag and my cats loved it i went back to the store to buy more and guess what they were sold out this was almost a year ago ! ! ! they still have not restocked this product because their corporate computers do all the ordering for them and not an actual human that knows what sells and what does n't needless to say , this store is a chain pet supply store and well , they have since lost a lot of local business \( from me alone \) as i have found that i can purchase the same product for much less via amazon and also get it in as little as a few days . 
wellness pure delights are very tasty , moist and healthy that most of our finicky cats seem to enjoy definitely will buy more in the future . 
although a little pricey , these are a great way to give your cat a healthy treat my cat has a sensitive stomach and cant always eat the treats i have gotten for him without him throwing up i stopped using grocery store treats and moved to natural balance but they were too much for his tummy , but these treats he absolutley loves and he never gets sick afterwards also , with the all natural ingredients i feel good about rewarding him br \( p s since they are natural ingredients they are stinky like salmon \) . 
i usually give my kitten catswell treats , because they are straight forward with ingredients , and use cage free chicken well petco did not have them in stock so this looked like a good alternative he likes these just as much as the other ones i tried giving another cat these treats and he kind of smelled it and walked away , but ended up eating it once it was on the floor . 
we recently adopted a shelter kitten and our vet recommended several natural food brands that she felt were superior to our regular supermarket cat food as we feel our new addition deserves the best we can give her we not only wanted to make sure her regular food was of high quality and good for her but as our vet said , do n't forget to check that her treats are high quality natural too as we were already purchasing the wellness brand from her list , we tried these treats br br on first glance i thought , wow , almost 5 00 for this little bag , that 's pricey , but they are very small jerky type treats and they last a long time if you are only giving your pet a few at a time my cat loves these and we have found that her coat seems to be very shiny and silky not sure if these treats contribute , but they could we love the fact that they do n't have corn , wheat , soy or a bunch of other stuff she really does n't need we also used these treats as a training incentive to teach her to sit for a treat it worked ! people laugh , but now we call her and hold up the bag and she looks up at her treat and sits down if you do n't give it to her right away she walks closer and sits again smart kitty and she loves those treats this is the first flavor we tried , but have since tried others and she loves them all br br if you would like to try something more natural for your kitty , i would give these a go we have been more than pleased and these are now the only treats we consider buying for her . 
my cat absolutely loves these things the only downside to them is that they will dry out after a while other than that , they 're great healthy cat snacks . 
annabelle \( my three year old persian mix \) absolutely adores these she does not like any other treats these are perfect , because they 're chewy , so they feel and taste different from her food she does tricks for them and always comes running when we bring them out definitely try them they are healthy \( grain free \) and perfect for any kitty ! to the comment about the bag , just buy a treat jar works much better , and it looks cuter on your shelf or counter \) . 
i have discovered the wellness brand of cat food , and i \( and my cat \) adore it i only wish it were easier to afford ! still , amazon seems to either match petsmart or have a better deal \( these treats , they only matched the price , but i like amazon \) br br when i open the bedside drawer that these are stored in , ariel comes running ! she would tear the bag open and eat them all if i were to accidentally leave it out ! she loves these treats br br i am glad that i can spoil my cat with healthy treats food like the wellness brand i highly recommend these treats , although as long as they remain 4 99 you might want to first purchase from a local pet store to make sure your cat likes them . 
the ingredients are good and my cat loves it she 's never walked away from it , so i was very surprised when my son 's cats did i decided to rate it from my cat 's point of view . 
i have 2 cats one will eat anything the other one is soooo picky she 's had to have some of her teeth removed due to a mouth virus , so i needed to find some good soft treats she likes these more than anything i 've tried they are really thing little tiny strips i like wellness , all natural products both cats like their brand cat food as well . 
on the first offer my ferret did n't want the treat but a couple of days later i noticed him trying to steal the whole bag , so i offered a piece again this time , and ever since , he 's loved it go figure ! br br i like this treat for ferrets because the pieces are appropriately sized \( ie small \) for a ferret , and the ingredients and stats are superior to most ferret treats ! his digestion has been less affected by these than by many ferret treats also \) . 
great natural treat for my cat , whose health i want to keep strong for many years and he loves them ! ! ! . 
i got these for my kitten and he loves them br br the comment made about the bag being hard to open is n't really that big of a deal , i have n't had any problems closing or opening properly though , i would much prefer a container type packaging since those are easier to get into especially if you 're training a cat you do n't want to hold a bunch of cat treats in your hand because the bag keeps closing on you but the bag closes opens like any other zip lock br br i feed my kitten chicken flavored cat food , so i try and offset the treats with a different meat and wellness salmon treats work great and it 's healthy without all those fillers br br this review is for the treat not the bag , so i highly recommended this 5 stars . 
my cat seems to really like these as one reviewer said , they will dry out if the bag is n't sealed i have n't had any problems with sealing the bag that i purchased . 
my cats loved the treats but everytime i try to use the bags zipper to close it up i gotta fiddle with it for a while just to close the bag eventually the bag did n't close properly and all the treats dried out causing the cats to lose interest i plan to buy another but this time i will dump it in my own container . 
i bought one of these bones for my lab shepard mix , 65 pound dog , and she loved it i bought the first one from petco and the large size was 8 dollars amazon is over 50 cheaper and there is free shipping before committing to 8 bones , you can do what i did and head on over to your local pet shop to see if they carry these bones and then see if your dog likes them it takes my lab about 1 hour to eat the whole bone i really like that it breaks into small pieces which eliminates my worries about my dog choking on a big piece of bone . 
i have a 10 month old weimaraner that loved the busy bone chewbone treat he has some separation anxiety and they can help keep him calm it takes him about 15 20 minutes to eat but it is long enough for him to calm himself down i just make sure he keeps it off white stuff the red center bleeds a little if he drops the wet side down or a piece gets broken off and falls on a light surface my dog will chew on one end then leave it if he gets distracted then come back and chew on the other end and the wet side dies surface he is on i have been able to clean it out of stuff easily enough but it is a little bit of a annoying that i have to i also wish they were cheaper . 
i like the busy bones my pit has to work at it a bit harder than she does some of other large bones on the market i do wish it would last a little longer she can finish one in under 5 minutes i'm giving it to her because i want her to be busy not distracted for 5 minutes . 
i buy this as a special treat it lasts about an hour and my large dog really enjoys it . 
these bones are pricey but my german shepard loves them because the bones are so dense and heavy they take a lot longer to devour , hence the name , busy bone . 
our german short haired pointer goes crazy for these bones they are big , tough and it takes our 100 pound dog a good hour to chew through this ! . 
this quality product is my dogs favorite healthy chew treat they enjoy the purina busy bone , immensely they prefer this treat to rawhide chews and do not quit on the purina busy bone until it is finished . 
bought these for my two dogs , one and english mastiff and the other a black mouth cur i thought it might keep them occupied for at least an hour as other reviewers had stated well , of course , my dogs had to be different 10 minutes flat , all chewed and gone i might add , both of my dogs are aggressive chewers and that 's the reason i went looking for something that would last for other dogs , who chew normally , it may well last for an hour or so br br they both love these bones and this packaging is a great buy i will continue to buy and give as a weekend treat for my boys . 
very tasty , i used it for years , they recently added more red peppers and that 's makes it more spicy that i prefer , but it still very good . 
we were unable to find this in any of our supermarkets since april finally decided to order it service was fast and product was what we were looking for for any of you who have never tried this , it makes mongolian beef better than any chinese restaurant . 
this product is excellent tried it one night for a quick , easy dinner and the whole family loved it , including my very fussy 19 year old daughter ! well worth trying for yourself . 
this seasoning is easy to use and delicious i recommend you add some sliced mushrooms too it 's a great addition served with brown rice and broccoli it 's a favorite at our house ! . 
i love this seasoning and actually bought it on amazon after searching everywhere to find it after the store i use to buy it from closed i use this seasoning with chicken , too . 
i bought this once at my local grocer and it was so good i went back to get more and it was gone i asked the store to get it again and they never did so found it at amazon placing my second order today since i am down to my last pack . 
this was the first time i have made mongolian beef my son suggested it , he had it at a friend 's house so with our next chinese dinner \( i like to make all my own foods \) we made this it was a tad spicy for me , perhaps i needed to add more beef or a little water will definitely make again by the way , you can buy the seasoning packet at wal mart br br redd1295 . 
this is a simple and delicious i have made this several times , just add beef and spring onions it is really delicious , tastes almost like the mongolian beef we order from pf changs china bistro one of my favorites and so easy too . 
when i lived in germany i bought this all the time over there the biggest problem was of course everything was written in german since you have a computer just go to a translation website and scan in the instructions and have them changed to english from there you can use the product . 
i recently invited a baby mini doxie into my family and had an existing 2 lb chihuahua that the vet constantly told me to try and fatten up i would try hamburger and cottage cheese and all the things he told me and she would either get a tummy ache or just not gain weight i bought this food with the doxie in mind and fed it to the chihuahua too and she started to gain weight within the week i now have to watch the portions i give her or she will over gain two healthy dogs with the help of this food when the doxie gets older , i will continue to buy the eukanuba adult brand . 
i now know why so many people recommended this brand the quality is amazing and you can tell the difference in substance compared to other dog foods even the organic type . 
puppy loves the food never has digestive issues love the 16 lb bag , so i only have to buy one per month . 
since i have not been able to eat fat there are many things that i miss eating tortillas were something i ate alot and really missed you would never know that these are fat free the only complaint that i have is that the tortillas stick together and i have torn many of them i would say that in the big picture i would rather have a torn tortilla that no tortilla at all i plan to reorder when i run out . 
the fat free la bandarita flour tortillas are great when i can find them br wal mart is supposed to carry them in my local stores , but they do n't br so i turned to amazon , and now they do n't have them either ! . 
one of the best mass produced teas i have tried light keemun flavour , delicious with or without milk and can sit in the pot without tasting stewed a great bargain in the 6 pack . 
i had tried this tea in bags before i prefer leaf tea when the local shop ran out of irish breakfast tea , i tried this instead very good flavor that recalls uk trips i would recommend this tea to anyone . 
a delicious strong black tea with enough flavor to stand up to milk and sugar might take some getting used to if you do n't usually drink black tea , but for the aficionado it 's one of the best . 
this is my new favorite tea it is absolutely delicious and even after it 's sat and gotten cold , it 's good i'm not a fan of milk in my tea but i 'll drink this without sugar , no problem it has a naturally creamy flavor fantastic tea . 
i ordered these as a gift in june they tasted great ! they did not arrive in picture perfect condition due to the heat but i was contacted by the company to see what they could do for me the strength of a company is not found in things that go correctly but rather in the things that go wrong and what they do about them i would recommend them highly . 
they were shipped in ice that 's pretty cool they arrived in the summer texas heat without even the slightest hint of melting . 
simply splendid chocolate covered cherry cordials ! perhaps the best we have found i went to their web site and found a large assortment of other chocolates and ordered more from there they shipped quickly \( ordered december 3rd , arrived the 7th \) the candy was slightly melted \( who would expect 80 degree heat on december 7th \? oh , yeah , fort worth , texas \) however , my wife loved them ! . 
my wife is very fond of chocolate covered cherries and has tried just about every brand she assures me that these are the very best she 's ever eaten . 
very welcome addition to the kitchen cupboard these usda organic small black lentils westbrae brand come packed to the top in a 15 ounce can and are ready to eat the ingredients are water , organic black lentils , and sea salt nutrition info is br servings per container 3 5 br serving size 1 2 cup \( or 130 grams \) br calories per serving 90 br fat \( trans , saturated \) 00 zero br cholesterol 0 zero br sodium 125 milligrams br total carb 16 grams br dietary fiber 8 grams br sugars 1 gram br protein 7 grams br since beluga black lentils are said to have a higher protein content \( 24 grams per serving \? \) you can see that these small black lentils are different from beluga br i was glad to see that nice blue label on the website for heirloom beluga lentils , glad to learn about them and would like to order them what i received from this webpage was small black lentils , not beluga instead of belugas , i received vegetarian organic black lentils not that i'm sorry about it the can label has a wonderful recipe for soup , and a vegetarian diet pyramid for nutrition these small black organic lentils are delicious and nourishing i recommend them to you to try , and i 'd like an opportunity to order and try the heirloom beluga lentils as well sometime you 'll like the small organic black lentils , many ways to serve them . 
my dog loves greenies and did n't notice the switch from the regular to the lite she loves them either way ! . 
this product is very healthy for your body , it is cost effective because is not mixed with other things , it comes with a little spoon with the right measurement for your drinks i bought it in peru , and i want to find it in the us is better than other stevia products i have bought in the past . 
taste is much superior to the regular freeze dried that you get in the supermarket i would bet you will enjoy the taste as much as we do . 
i love cherry soda , but this product is the best cherry soda that i have ever tasted sweet and slightly tart at one and the same time try it once , and you will be hooked for good . 
in the winter when fresh blueberries exceed our food budget these dried blue berries are fine for muffins , breads and puddings p we also enjoy fruit on our cereal in the winter it is often oatmeal and we sprinkle these blueberries on a bowl of oatmeal wonderful on a cold morning . 
was pleasantly surprised at how good these pretzels were there are 3 servings per bag at 140 calories each this is about 14 to 15 pretzels the pretzels are really filling the bag has approximately 45 pretzels i was expecting them to be bland since they are made with natural ingredients but they are very flavorful made in the usa is a big plus . 
these are delicious , with just the right touch of mustard and a nice crunch i would definitely consider buying them again the bags are generously filled , too . 
five gum is a new product from wrigley 's i'm always on the lookout for new gum since i like having something to chew while i'm driving i came across this back in august and was pleasantly surprised the flavor lasts a really long time and is relatively strong . 
zen brews up to an golden amber liquor the aroma is sweet spearmint the blending of this tea is excellent spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor , then you taste a hint of lemon the green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste br br remember that this tea does have caffeine however , it does not say how much on the box a good estimate might be 30 mg compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter four minutes is ample . 
light , sweet and oh so good is how i would describe this tea i first had it at a hotel at the complimentary breakfast and loved it so much , i went to amazon and ordered more that same day . 
this passion tea is used at starbucks we mix it with two lipton tea bags for iced tea really good , fruity flavor great for summer ! . 
the vendor is fast and dependable the tea is simply the best way to relax and great tasting too highly recommend ! ! . 
this tea is amazing i drink it iced with sugar and lime it will blow your mind the taste is similar to a flavor of kool aid that i had as a child i can just drink glass after glass of this tea . 
sharp orange flavor with a tolerable spearmint taste i 've tried many of the less expensive brands and have n't liked any other except this one and good seasons tuscany i'm not crazy about all of the tazo drinks , but this one is nice i love drinking this tea with chocolate it comes in an orange package you can also smell the other spices do n't make the mistake i make , by adding too much water as with many products , amazon is over charging . 
i had a difficult time trying to find aluminum free baking soda and finally found it on amazon it was shipped quickly and the seller put in several free samples of natural beverage mixes \( which i really appreciated and will use \) very pleased with this product . 
i was real happy to find this no stores in my area carry it , nor does my health food store i feel better knowing this is aluminum free i basically use it to maintain a ph of around 7 works perfect . 
aluminum free baking soda is something every ic sufferer should have on hand in case of flare ups this baking soda is just as effective as regular baking soda , but without the toxic aluminum highly , highly recommend super fast shipping , too , great seller ! . 
i bought this baking soda to clean my teeth 3 times a week they say that teeth become noticeably whiter br but you 've to to be very gentle while brushing and use soft type tooth brush i did notice a difference br br also , i noticed that when baking soda was mixed with water , the ph indicator showed the highest level \( almost 8 5 9 on the chart \) br this may explain why baking soda is so effective to fight germs br br it 's a good product . 
just to clear things up , no brand of baking soda contains aluminum some baking powders do \( so check these labels \) , but not baking soda the benefits of this brand vs a h , for example , is the way in which they are mined bob 's is mined naturally so this baking soda is in it 's natural state \( yay \) a h on the other hand uses chemicals during it 's mining process so , yes , bob 's is more natural no , you do n't have to worry about aluminum when buying any brand of baking soda \( this label is just a marketing gimmick for shame \) check out . 
bob 's red mill baking soda is an excellent product for baking with or making your own toothpaste br it is aluminum free and free of any other harmful chemicals we use it as a safe legal product br on the specific carbohydrate diet in healing my boys with asd and healing my own fibromyalgia br as we have difficulty ridding our body of harmful toxins in foods . 
i have been using this product to increase my ph score after a bout of ta state 1 bladder cancer there is no aftertaste and it leaves me with a clean feeling delivery from amazon 's vendor in kentucky was slow . 
working to reduce m my body 'd ph , helping to reduce the effects of my psoriasis , using twice a day first in the morning , last at night , mixing with a half a lemon and 10 oz of filtered water , seems to be helping . 
i 've found this product \( bob 's red mill bicarbonate of soda or soda bicarb without aluminum \) to be just as i 'd hoped i use it in a 3 to 1 \( pure maple syrup to bob 's soda bicarb \) ration , respectively , as an anti cancer holistic therapy approach to a recent rise in my \( 16 year \) post op psa i do n't have the results yet , as i'm only in my third week of use my next psa lab test will tell the story \( these tests should be conducted by the same laboratory , as differing labs employ different reagents and the results may vary to some degree \) br a href http www amazon com gp product b0041ckrjc bob'red mill aluminum free baking soda 16 oz bundle of 4 a br br this product is mixed with the maple syrup , heated and stirred in a large pot \( when mixed , the two react and create an initial rapidly expanding and foaming mixture which soon 'settles down' \) for five minutes , not to exceed 120 degrees farenheit the mixture will not remain as a homogeneous mixture it will separate and must be stirred with each use the goal is to raise one 's systemic ph to above 7 i 've been keeping mine at 8 to 9 avoid use of sugar , white bread , meat and alcohol during therapy one may check several testimonials on the internet by searching for maple syrup soda bicarb therapy my height is 5' 10 weight 164 lbs i average 2 1 2 tablespoons of this mixture morning and evening \( before breakfast and after dinner \) br best to use a funnel and pour the heated stirred mixture into a clean plastic milk bottle this makes re mixing by shaking easier br br i measure my ph at least twice daily , prior to taking each dose , using the urine test strips purchased through amazon made by phinex these strips will also measure one 's ph by testing saliva \( probably more accurate at the moment tested as the urine may have accumulated over a period of hours a combination of high ph and , possibly a current acetic ph level the goal is to maintain an alkaline ph level br br see br br the author is not a member of the medical profession this account is not to be interpreted as a recommendation to engage in the therapy described , nor to imply its efficacy as a treatment for any disease one must decide for one 's self upon any course of action to be taken with regard to addressing any medical condition . 
okay so i bought this product and then had to laugh upon further research discovering that all baking soda is aluminum free it 's baking powder that has aluminum in it the cheapest baking soda you can find is still aluminum free it 's still good baking soda though , and kudos to the bob 's red mill marketing department you guys are geniuses . 
i really like bob 's red mill products this item came promptly and is perfect for my baking needs i totally recommend it ! . 
i got this product for consumption , i took some of the store bought baking soda and did not know it is loaded with aluminum , so glad i was able to find this product thru amazon , and after reading all the positive reviews i got it and started taking some with a glass of water , great product , fast delivery , great price , very happy with my purchase . 
i just called bob 's red mill and talked to a representative there i was told that the packaging has been changed and no longer states aluminum free but natural it would be helpful if amazon clearly stated that the packaging has been changed by bob 's red mill so that one will not be ordering bob 's red mill aluminum free baking soda when this is no longer an item it would save wasted time by customers who are trying to rectify what was sent when it appears that a name change took place it would also spare vendors from receiving less than excellent reviews . 
all i can say , is that it give me peace of mind , knowing that i am not ingesting aluminum ! br ca n't tell any difference same taste as the regular arm hammer . 
real salt is good and good for you doesnt take much to flavor foods with this product try it for yourself today . 
this is the best coffee i 've ever tasted , and at a reasonable price outstanding coffee ! thanks , coffee bean direct . 
this coffee has a taste so good and so distinctive great aftertaste and low acid are welcome additions to it the best i have ever bought on amazon . 
these beans are my favorite for making espresso i get the most amazing crema from them , especially when i grind them frozen and store them in the freezer we have tried quite a few different kinds of beans , but we stopped looking after we found this one using a baby gaggia espresso machine . 
i agree with one of the previous posts coffee is a matter of personal taste my wife and i really liked this coffee , it was fresh and flavorful if you like dark roasts , do n't buy this one , it is definitely not dark the flavor is very distinct and pleasant , as opposed to some kuna and blue mountain blends we have tried before . 
i purchased this coffee because my subscription hawaiian peaberry coffee was wiped out due to unusual weather and insects in hawaii while these peaberry beans are smaller than the kona , they have a much more full bodied taste there were hints of cocoa bean and something else i could n't put my finger on it 's also about 50 less that what i pay for the kona coffee ! gotta love it ! . 
i 've drunk whole bean tanzanian peaberry for about 20 years my first source was the large national retailer and wholesaler green mountain , which roasted their tanzanian peaberry light to medium although the beans made good coffee , green mountain 's price eventually became higher than i thought reasonable an internet seach led me to a small family owned and family operated roaster in tennessee their beans were also light to medium and , thus , had a dry appearance that level of roasting was to my liking because the beans retain more caffeine , and the natural flavor of the coffee is more apparent than with darker roasts when the tennessee roaster 's computer system crashed and online sales were temporarily suspended , i did another internet search and found amazon 's tanzanian peaberry roasted by coffee bean direct it has essentially the same good taste as the tanzanian peaberry from the tennessee roaster , and the price is lower i'm totally satisfied with the beans roasted by coffee bean direct , and the shipping by amazon is quick enough that buying three pounds at a time allows me to place my next order before the current one runs out . 
i was in love from the moment i opened a bag and took the first whiff however , it did take me a while to figure out the right brewing method , because i found it was much easier to scald might be just me though first i boil the water , but whereas usually i just let it sit there for about a minute to cool , here i actually poured it into a pot and let it sit for about 2 or 3 minutes then i grind the beans medium coarse \( it smells heavenly \) and 2 tablespoons into the french press it goes pour the water in , and i let it sit for a bit longer than usual , too \( still hot though \) i find that it has a very nice sort of crunchy , hard caramelized sugar finish to it , kind of tastes like the top of a cr egrave me brulee delicious i drink it black . 
this is really good coffee good enough to make me buy a burr grinder to grind it to the fineness i like without having to hawk watch the old bladed one i 've always liked peaberry , generally speaking and this one is a really , really nice peaberry full flavor , low acid , smooth kinda luscious actually br the only reason i did n't go to five stars is that i have had a better peaberry but it was nowhere near this price i hope this price stays where it is . 
we usually have fresh lemon grass tea at our local zen center it is extremely easy to make , put a few blades of lemon grass in a pot to steep and you will get a fantastic tasting tea br br this tea is here is a fine replacement for when you cannot get fresh lemon grass lemon grass has many health benefits it is said to detoxify the liver and can lower uric acid levels , this is important if you have gout br br because you get such a large quantity here on amazon it should last you quite a while caffeine free and light it makes a very refreshing afternoon tea br br give it a try ! br br thank you for reading my review . 
i have a lemongrass plant in my yard i make tea from it but i wanted convenient tea bags to take to work or drink whenever i wanted the tea from this box tastes exactly the same it is some of the best tea i have ever tasted i prefer to drink it hot but it can be made cold it is such a relaxing beverage i can drink it before bed because it has no caffeine i highly recommend this tea . 
this is a good tea that has a nice flavor my only complaint is that for a rich tea , you have to use extra tea bags this is sold in bulk which helps off set the price for using more tea bags . 
a pack of 18 on any of horizon 's flavors , cost about 15 00 this is ridiculously expensive ! ! but the product itself is excellent ! ! . 
these individually packed milk is great for on the road does not need to be stored in the frig this item came in 6 packs of 3 then shipped in its original box and then another amazon box over it the content was securely packed and i was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping the price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle the only reason that i did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date it is mar 2012 which is not too far away i just bought one from target \( because i forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless \) and it has an expiration date of sept 2012 overall , i would still recommend to buy from amazon . 
i love milk only organic milk horizon is my favorite these little cartons are great for on the go if not opened can be does not spoil long as not opened great for on the go packing for a trip . 
i bought this for a trip and it was so wonderful that i'm planning to buy more it 's a good way to keep your kids well fed with good quality organic milk , even if you are not home . 
i still like cherry the best but the blue zotz are good the turn your tounge blue so watch out for that . 
i love this product tazo has produced a mild , yet sweet and spicy tea that i can only call magic sweet cinnamon spice has a flavor all on it 's own , and i highly recommend it for adventurous spice tea drinkers looking for that perfect balance . 
delicious , flavorful tea a must for cinnamon lovers it also has a pleasant sweetness that even those of us who do n't use sweeteners can enjoy wonderful as a hot drink , but i especially like it as a cold drink . 
i love this tea and i hate that it is so hard to find ! i am so glad it is available on amazon ! . 
this tea is perfect for me i have many food allergies and associated diet restrictions , so i cannot have regular tea and many herbal teas this is a good tasting alternative to plain chamomile , which was previously my only option for tea i love it ! it 's hard to find at stores , and was previously sold out here , so i'm glad to see it 's back . 
tazo sweet cinnamon spice tea is a very tasteful tea with no unpleasant after taste i am not sure what a person can say about tea , but this flavor is one of the best i have ever had it makes great hot tea or iced tea it 's pleasant flavor is a treat all by itself and is excellent without any sweetener br br some teas leave a bitter or strange after taste but this tea does not every cup is very special even if you leave the tea bag in your cup for a long time , it never gets bitter wonderful product ! a href http www amazon com gp product b000e1588o tazo sweet cinnamon spice herbal infusion tea , caffeine free , 20 count tea bags \( pack of 6 \) a . 
i tried this first in a sampler pack and was immediately hooked i put a bit of sugar and honey in it and at that point its basically like drinking a cinnamon roll . 
i had ordered this tea , as i have been on a cinnamon kick i enjoy it for it 's smooth cinnamon flavor i shared it with my friends , and they have made all sorts of positive comments on it i will probably be ordering more , even though i thought it would be a long time , having to order a case of it thanks , amazon and tazo . 
our small family member loves these slivers every morning he sits and waits to get one these are just the right size for him thank you for giving us a great produce will order again . 
i ordered it 2 times and never had a problem like the reviewer above and i gonna compare it with my fav brand crown prince later then i 'll order it again delicious for making a tropical fish soup and more . 
ordered these seeds for a recipe that i got from my grandmother seeds came very quickly and well packaged much cheaper than buying all those small bottles at the grocery store would definatly use this company again . 
i grew up in upstate ny where this stuff was born it is pretty much a regional favorite that just has n't caught on yet and aside from here , upstate ny is the only place to get it what you do is use the spiedie sauce to marinate cubes of chicken overnight , then just grill them up , slide 'em on a soft italian roll and add some mayo bam ! good eats ! i use this stuff at home in the dc area and i would highly recommend the marinade to anyone looking for a something different in their chicken ! . 
i love this stuff my dad brought some home from his home town in new york love it great marinade we skewer beef or moose cubes after letting them sit in marinade love it ! . 
i love chipotle back here in ma when i live now , it was years before you could find any products with chipotle things are better now , but i still have to fetch chipotle things in ca and i was so ticked off when tsa would not let me take this stuff on the plane so i have been forced to order this stuff online for years of all my sauces though this one is my go to favorite and it is the roasted garlic it is a real sauce changer it adds a complexity to the sauce that is really just different but i love roasted garlic too so the best of two worlds combined i keep other hot sauces around for different ethnic foods , but when i eat hummus \( which is a lot \) this is the one i reach for in the fridge . 
this energy drink has worked for me i drink one in the morning for my drive to work , and one before i work out at night grape is ok , fruit punch is better . 
our cats just love this stuff they eat the ultra premium dry food and ocean fish canned food we 've given them some of the other formulas and they 'd slowly eat them but they wo n't leave the ocean fish alone . 
very healthy ingredients compared to store brands my br cats love this they are fussy eaters so i think many br cats would love this food will buy it again . 
tried this for the first time last night and really liked it , it had a great taste good for when you want something but do not want to ruin your diet bought them in the grocer for 7 99 i thought that was expensive hopefully i can find them cheaper elsewhere . 
not bad this tea does not taste like an oolong tea i'm sure if they say it 's oolong , then it probably is an oolong , but it really tastes more like a green tea it 's also very mildly flavored i find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended there 's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea , and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this the flower bloom is durable i put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea , and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating if anything , the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew served cold , the flavor comes out even more if you 're partial to iced tea br br the flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that numi shows on their website , and it 's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up some of them even bloom upside down do n't expect perfection and you 'll be pleased with it . 
a classic pasta amatriciana requires this beautiful and mild form of bacon , and as with every other product i have purchased from them , la quercia has nailed guanciale br br a little guanciale , rendered a bit but still tender , some diced tomatoes , a little peccorino romano , a pinch of crushed red pepper , and you are done the guanciale is the star , and this guanciale really stands up served with bucatini pasta , and you might as well be in rome . 
silken tofu is so versatile creamy salad dressing , sauce , etc so glad i purchased it at amazon the price was excellent , packing fine and delivery quick . 
i'm new to tofu , newly vegan , and was dismayed at the price of tofu in local health food stores and the scarcity of it in regular grocery stores i was hesitant to purchase in bulk , but am so glad i did i purchased both the soft and the firm versions , and it has been great in every recipe ! i will definitely be ordering again ! . 
morinu soft tofu makes the best puddings i also make vegan mayonaise and salad dressings with it works out great . 
i love silken tofu and use it a lot to make smoothies for myself and my toddlers this is good quality silken tofu and i was happy with the price and convenience of having it delivered to my door \( it 's hard to find in grocery stores around here ! \) . 
the quality of tofu is very good but it is a little bit more soft than what i expected i will try the firm version . 
i am practicing a vegan diet and this is an excellent product with a very good shelf life i also buy some tofu that you can keep in refrigerator \( which cost me 0 99 ea tax \) but i like to take this one with me when i travel and just to have some on hand at home \( in case i run out of refrigerated tofu \) excellent product ! . 
this tofu is so silky , my smoothie is the smoothest with this tofu ! ! i also like that i can store the extra tofu in the cupboard until i open the package . 
i was really glad to find this tofu on amazon i eat tofu on a daily basis and this is one of the best there is i will definitely be buying on a regular basis . 
i have been looking for morinu soft tofu , silken i was happy when i found that amazon com had it i still do n't know if i like it as well as the firm i have to try it a little longer .

we do pet adoptions and also run a shelter for cats i personally own 7 cats ! ! ! i have absolutely never had a problem with feeding these to any of my cats br br they have never vommited from this treat , i have a hard time believing this ! ! br br i do know that the recommended amt of treats is only 10 i have never fed more then 10 12 at a time ! br br at home i have adopted a persian and i often use the hairball treatments with her and they actually do work ! ! ! ! ! i give her the suggested doce of 10 treats at a time and they are very tasty since , i have never seen her gag from hairballs , not once ! br br all of my cats come running when i open these treats my favorites are the vitamins as well as the hairball and the regular plain i also love to feed them they love them all ! br br the only other treats i feed usually are pounce and party mix but temptations are there favortires ! br br i have about 8 bags of these in my cabinets because i have a lot of treats ! br br at the shelter i run , we keep all kinds of cats and kittens and we have about 35 right now and none have never had any problems with these treats to date i am sorry that others have maybe had problems but these are the most tastiest and healthy treats available i also love that they provide great dental care and tarter control br br providing these treats i honestly feel that my vet bills will be less in the future with also providing treats that they absolutely love ! ! ! ! br br my mom and i pay the vet bills for any sick cats , we love cats ! ! ! so far we have been blessed with wonderful healthy strays and none have been diagnosed with feline aids or leukemia and we do vaccinate and have them tested br br please give these treats a try , they are awesome ! oh and also buy the large bags because it is actually saving you lots of money from buying the smaller bags you get about 3x the ammount ! . 
it is amazing to see the even split on reviews i have a ragdoll cat who was having the occasional hairball he loves these treats and has only had one hairball since \( shortly after starting these \) i could n't be happier with the product br br i got them at walmart the current amazon seller seems to be a rip off . 
not only kept her clear , she put much needed weight on after diagnosed with a chronic illness she has beaten i 've read some of the other reviews as a former vet technician i do ask , if your cat is vomiting please see your vet asap hairballs that are very bad can kill a cat . 
and they never vomit they wolf them down , thought i think they are crunching they have n't totally stopped their occasional hairball hacking , but it is rare perhaps they would completely solve it if i could afford to give them to them all the time only problem with this product is i would love to buy it in a larger bag if they just made one if your cat 's do n't like 'em move on , but definately worth a try if you want a treat that also helps with hairballs . 
bobby loves these treat so much and they work very well for hairballs he has long hair and if he goes without these treats for a few days he is throwing up hairballs , and driving me crazy begging for his treats i have been able to teach him to stay off of things by not giving him treats too i noticed that bobby always chews them well so that may be the reason that some cats vomit . 
my cat is very picky and this is the only hairball remedy that i can give him that he eats and it works ! i do n't have a problem with him vomiting at all i give him about 8 10 treats per day \( and you have to make sure that you are giving them on an empty stomach \) , and the hairballs pass through his system he never spits them up i used to purchase them at the store , but they stopped carrying this specific type and only sell the hairball tartar control combo ones now my cat hates them so happy to find these online ! . 
as with most cats i 've read about here , both of mine gulp these down without even the slightest tooth mark in them this can make them vomit so my trick is to snap them in two so then they have to chew them because of the ragged edges i m used to the snapping since i have persians \( they have smaller mouths than a regular tom does \) and these are n't hard to snap at all they love the taste of these although i'm not all that sure they really help with the furballs does anything really help though \? ! \) i do recommend these because of the great taste , but try snapping them in two if your cat has trouble vomiting after gulping his her food . 
i was reminded of my mother 's cat when i read the comments about vomiting mom 's cat gulps the whiskas temptations whole and resembles a kirby vaccuum ! if you inhaled your food , you would vomit too ! with my kitties , it is an entirely different story they love them , they chew them , they purr these are not a dietary supplement , they are a treat i even managed to train my eldest kitty to shake hands using temptations i will definately buy them , again and again . 
not exactly sure whether it really mediate hairball issue because my short hair russian blue rarely vomits while my mixed medium hair toby vomits quite frequently , regardless of the treat nevertheless , my cats do love it greatly , always rushing to me whenever i grab it . 
i received my cat 's treats quickly and the product works very well the best part is that the cats love it , so i do n't have to force them to take their cure for hairballs ! . 
just like the other reviewer , my cat wants to eat these instead of his actual meals ! lol he 's truly addicted i am glad they have this formula with the hairball control , they have helped out so much and he rarely gets them anymore ! . 
my 13 year old cat wants to skip meals all he wants is whiskas temptations ! he particularly loves the ones for hairball control he will find the place that they are stored and either knock then off a table or come to me , put his paw on my hand and look me straight in the eye until i give him he likes nothing better that these treats ! got a good deal for them on line saved several dollars on 32 bags ! ! . 
bought it first at costco but they recently stopped stocking it my daughter loves dipping her carrots in this dressing instead of ranch dressing also great for salads . 
fell in love with this dressing after trying and buying it at costco they do n't carry it anymore , so i am glad to find it here so much fuller tasting than average grocery store salad dressing brands yes , it is sweet and a little tangy , kind of thick \( we like it because it has no egg \) we just do n't seem to get tired of it have not tried it as a marinade thought i better add our review , since we appreciate the comments of others . 
i like to baste this heavily over pork roast and serve extra on the side my family loves it ! . 
we love anything with onions and this certainly is a great product wonderfull flavor , sweet and tangy delicious on so many things we have tried this on plain chicken , omelets , and even hamburgers will be trying this on pork over the weekend great price i hope this will always be available through amazon . 
not sure what anyone else uses this sauce for , but we use it with our roast beef sandwiches and it 's amazingly good also , i use it for my roasted vegetables or roasted potatoes it 's delicious as a coating with garlic powder , rice flour , and pepper it is sweet , but not sickeningly so we love it ! . 
excellent product i use it almost every night used to be available through costco , but they no longer handle it br i would recommend it to anyone . 
one day my husband and i were at costco they had the oak hill farms vidalia onion vinaigrette on the shelf i said wow this really looks good but i put it back on the shelf when we got to the check out stand , there it was in the basket my husbands says , it did look good now i need to tell you that my husband is not a salad person but he decided to try this salad dressing by the end of the month we had 16 bottles of the salad dressing costco did not have it anymore so i would check on line every day until it was available and i ordered 6 bottles do n't want my husband to run out of that dressing again that 's my story and it is the truth . 
this is the best salad dressing , delivered promptly and in quantities that will last a while no other vidalia onion dressing compares to that made by oak hill farms sometimes you can find it at costco , but you can order it to your front door if they want even more orders , they can cut down their shipping costs . 
vidalia onion dressing is one of my favorite salad dressings , and oak hill farms beats the other brands hands down ! a great flavor , and popular with my dinner guests i highly recommend it ! . 
i used this vidalia onion sauce as a bbq kebob marinade try it by mixing it with 2 cubed pork necks , 2 medium onions \( half rings \) and 4 6oz of this onion sauce mix everything \( pork neck cubes , onions and onion sauce \) in the mixing bowl and leave it in covered in the fridge for 12 hours . 
i use this as my secret ingredient for pasta salad which is always a hit ! i also use it in chicken , tuna and egg salad and have used it in deviled eggs too i started using it also via costco and was very disappointed when they stopped carrying it i put in a request for them to start carrying it again and we 'll see what happens i'm just very happy that i can still find it somewhere ! . 
we used to buy this item at costo warehouse , but they quit carrying it br we really like vidalia onion vinaigreet and therefore looked for a place to buy it br thanks great product . 
ca n't find this or anything like it in our stores anymore good to know i can get it on here . 
this will be great with all that i use it for br thanks , linda . 
if you like triscuit crackers , then this is the healthy version with the same great taste and texture amazingly there is not much of a price difference \( 12 9 5oz for 33 36 vs 12 8 5 oz for 29 83 \) to purchase the better quality cracker if the coupon offer is in effect , then these crackers are also the price winner ! the only disadvantage is since i think these are healthy , i eat more of them at one time than i would normally of the other brand they are sooooo tasty w melted cheddar cheese on top or warmed crab dip enjoy ! . 
i first purchased these crackers because they have no soy in them my daughter is allergic to soy , and soy free crackers are very hard to find i bought them , and to my amazement , my picky husband also loves them ! he prefers them to all other similar crackers i purchased a large number of boxes \( which i keep hidden \) as they tend to disappear rather quickly . 
i 've bought three kinds of the back to nature crackers now , i'm so impressed by the brand and with my food allergy problem , i was excited to find them i normally get the rounds , which are terrific with my manchego cheese so this time around i tried the crispy thins and the harvest whole wheat the harvest whole wheat closely resembles triscuits a good thing however i'm disappointed they are so salty i would 've strongly preferred less or no salt i'm perplexed about why a supposed healthy cracker would be so salty so i wo n't be ordering this one again which is a bummer . 
healthy , delicious , and great for food allergies ! no soy , corn etc only contains wheat , safflower oil , and salt . 
it 's very delicious and i love salty foods but i wish that contains olive oil instead of safflower oil \( . 
these taste just as good as triscuits in my opinion br i have not found them to be overly salty br i buy these as a cheaper alternative br br if you want to know the source of any of the ingredients , you should ask the company soy is a natural ingredient i am not sure what the 1 star review is about . 
back to nature harvest whole wheats crackers , 8 5 ounce boxes \( pack of 12 \) my wife 's all time favorite crackers only sporadically available at acme supermarkets and perfectly delivered by the case by amazon . 
excellent choice for a high fiber cracker these taste great and like other back to nature items , do n't have all the undesirable ingredients you 'd like to avoid if necessary whole wheat , safflower oil , salt and vitamin e perfect . 
i'm not a huge fan of salt , so take that warning with a grain of , well you know for most people the salt on these is probably fine they stay crispy over long periods of storage , even after the package has been opened and split into tupperware containers , they 're reasonably sturdy , they pair well with all but the saltiest cheeses \( would n't put blues on them \) , they pair great with unsalted pb just a great all around cracker to keep in the house they 've become a staple of my diet and , unlike every other cracker i 've bought in bulk , and there have been many , they have n't developed some weird off flavor due to over familiarization or the cracker becoming stale they still taste good , like a simple cracker i 'll be ordering them again ! . 
my family loves the taste of these they 're a bit high in sodium for my liking and for the price , i wish they were organic i have purchased the heart to heart brand , but they taste much staler and have a strange aftertaste compared to these crackers too bad , because heart to heart has half the sodium . 
very closely resembles a triscuit cracker except there is no soy ! \( and a bit lighter \) br br you will not be disappointed with the taste and texture , it is a quality cracker br br enjoy . 
i love them my kids and i eat them a box at a time we have replaced chips \( and other bad for you snacks \) with these just wish they were organic . 
my son has nut allergies and us made are not safe for him since early childhood now 19 the british nestle co have made a treat for him thrilled to have his favorite and in dark , great and quick service and delivery ! . 
my cats love the food , and it 's on the happy list of companies that do n't test on animals linked through the peta site , peta org that is very reassuring . 
i have 16 cats ranging from 1 to 11 yrs old and every single one of them likes this i have tried wellness , holistic , avoderm , chicken soup for the , merck homestyle , bg \( before grain \) , california natural , and evangers with mixed results this is the first canned food that all of them will not only eat but eat all of it i 've fed them the chicken and liver flavor and the seafood flavor so far and they seem to like both equally i find it a bit more expensive than i had hoped it would be , but then again there is no waste and i consider that in itself a savings alone i'm a firm believer in better ingredients and less fillers and allergens make for less poop , less litter use , fewer trips to the vet and an overall healthier cat br br update i have tried all the flavors on my cats and the chicken and liver seems to be the one they like the most they have now officially rejected all the other flavors including the seafood flavor that they originally liked i also wanted to add that this is a very strong smelling brand of cat food , almost overpowering when i open the cans at feeding time . 
our older cat is having some health issues , which i suspect could have been caused by pet foods many of us buy in local stores we 've been on a mission to find a healthy pet food we could trust after all the pet food recalls after going through way too many products trying to find one that did all it claimed to do , we found the petguard line of food this one really does appear to be all it claims to be and our cats are thriving on it ! our older cat loves it and is acting more like a kitten than he 's acted in years both of our cats fur is silky and smooth and they seem to have endless energy , not to mention they love this stuff ! our youngest cat has digestion problems and most cat foods give him horrible gas but not this cat food ! he is n't having any digestion problems at all br both our cats love the fish , chicken liver dinner but our older cat is n't crazy about the seafood savory dinner he 'll eat it but much prefers the fish , chicken and liver br from my point of view , the fish , chicken and liver dinner does n't smell too bad , but the seafood savor dinner smells really bad ! br one problem i have with the food i 've purchased from amazon is that every single can in the case has been dented i 've purchased 2 cases and it 's been the same with both cases i 've purchased this from other vendors and never received a dented can , so this seems to be an amazon problem not sure why , but some of the cans are really hard to open ! br i'm relieved to finally find a food i'm not afraid to feed my pets i 've read articles about this food that state the meat used in it is a grade that can be consumed by humans that makes me feel much better about what my cats are eating br update br it 's been about a year since we started using this and our older cat is doing very well on it amazon was out of stock once when i needed to reorder , so i purchased another organic brand not only did our older cat turn up his nose to the other brand , but so did our 2 other cats they would not eat the other kind , so when pet guard was back in stock , i ordered another case and the cats were happy kitties ! they all love this stuff i think it stinks , but apparently , that 's part of the attraction for them . 
i 've been using this all natural cat food for a few years when i could afford it but did n't think to shop where i buy my books with free shipping i only wish amazon offered a few more flavors since many commercial cat foods are made with grade d mest \( not fit for human consumption \) i am delighted to have this choice . 
i have found this cat food to be the purrfect choice for both my cat with ibd and my cat with diabetes howard and miss c are thriving on this diet of turkey and brown rice and enjoy it so much more than prescription diets the price was great too for a premium cat food . 
my cats love this food they always lick every last morsel of it i love it too because it is one of the best values for a high quality canned food . 
i have three cats have had cats for years , this food smells better than most , my cats like it , the ingredients appear to be better than the average cat food so far , so good ! i 'll continue to use it for my cats . 
i 've been on the hunt for high quality cat food that does n't cost a fortune after a lot of research at various sites petguard was one on my list to try , so i ordered a case from amazon and could n't be happier 2 3 of my cats love it , the 3rd cat is a dry food addict and i'm in the process of trying to convert her but it 's slow going be warned though , this stuff smells terrible , opening a can and dishing it out is like being slapped in the face with a week old mackerel , but that 's how cats like it br br bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality it has low carbs , low ash magnesium , high protein , real human grade meat with no by products , the vitamins minerals are chelated for better absorption and petguard has stated they do not use bpa lined cans also , contrary to what the ingredient list here on amazon says it does not contain menadione sodium bisulfite or at least the case i ordered does n't have any listed , so they must have stopped using it , which is a big plus . 
my cats both love this food i 've had varying success with about 7 different kinds of canned food this one is a hit with both it 's natural , mostly organic , does n't have any junk or fillers , and i have peace of mind knowing that we 're giving them high quality food from an ethical company since they 've been on this diet they are more active , alert and happy their coats are so soft and shiny and they seem to be shedding less cannot say how relieved i am to have finally found a food they like that is so good for them as well it is pricey but if you want to save on costly vet bills down the road due to illness caused by poor nutrition , this is the way to go . 
bought both the savory seafood and the chicken and wheat germ , as the kittens liked the fish , chicken and liver flavor they are not so fond of it , but will eat if there is nothing else also , they will only eat it as soon as a can is opened , there is no hope of putting half a can in tupperware and feeding it to them later oh , yeah , and stinky but a good product if your kitty likes the taste . 
i have 5 cats on this food as well as the seafood this is their favorite , but they will eat the seafood as well my old gentleman , 16 this year , loves it , and is doing very well on it quality ingredients for a fair price i do agree with the one reviewer who said the cans were all dented and hard to open mine have been the same with every shipment do n't know if that 's why the price is so good or not . 
i'm giving this a solid 5 , because my old but healthy cat loves this stuff and it 's wicked good for him , but i 'll tell you right now that this stuff looks and smells quite gross as long as i do n't have to eat it , it 's all good . 
the cats like this stuff pretty well , for the health of our felines we keep them on an all canned food diet this is one of their favorite flavors , i will admit that sometimes you can see bits of fish bone in the can , but the food seems to be of high quality i wish amazon woudl carry the organic versions of petguard canned food for cats . 
what can i say \? it 's cat food but without stuff in it cats should n't be eating it is her favorite flavor , but that depends on the cat . 
i just got this and so far my finicky cat loves it ! br one of my friends recommended i try this for my cat as she has allergies br that we think are food allergies and so far nothing else has helped br friend 's cat no longer has allergies on this food and i hope the same for mine only time will tell br br addendum she still loves it but for 20 plus in shipping which it now is , i 'll be switching to something else . 
my cats love the food , and it 's referenced on the list of companies that do n't test on animals through the peta web site . 
this is an excellent quality product i have a siberian husky , a breed which loves fish i have hard time finding fish in canned dog food , so i feed this food to my cat and dog and they both love it it has rice flour but no rice in it my cat does n't like the foods with rice , but she loves this sky and peaches highly recommend this food ! . 
i am a huge coffee drinker , and love the k cups for making one cup quickly before leaving for work in the morning while there are many choices , i prefer a bold , strong coffee first thing in the morning wolfgang puck french roast is absolutely delicious , strong and not at all bitter , and makes a great first cup of coffee i would highly recommend to all bold coffee drinkers ! . 
we always drink timmothy 's or emeril 's thought we would try something different not too many decafs to choose from we were pleasantly surprised that this had a great taste with a full bodied flavor i like my coffee on the milder side so i can even get 2 cups from 1 kcup . 
good subtle flavored coffee for the mid afternoon pick me up a bit of sweetness without being overdone wish it was available in whole bean as i like it stronger then the keurig cup can make it . 
wolfgang puck 's chef 's reserve colombian \( dark roast \) is basically what they said it will be dark roast , but not too strong acidity is on a low side , but with plenty of pleasant taste at the same time you can drink this coffee black w o the need for the sweetener and or milk this coffee is in european tradition and will please many people i would recommend it after dinner , but not if you need a jolt to wake you up . 
i purchased these for my mom and she loves them ! she does not like bold coffee flavors , but is more into the sweet and more flavorful varieties this one combines the taste of the islands with a smooth , nutty flavor amazon had a great price on these and this is something that i can actually recommend ! . 
i admit i do n't usually drink decaf but this is a favorite in my office and i felt it deserved a good rating . 
i tried this flavor within a variety pack and loved it ! i usually add cream and sugar to my coffee with this k cup i added coconut creamer and found that i did not have to add any sugar ! it was so sweet and light and tasted just like a pina colada i absolutley love this k cup and am planning to sign up for subscribe and save on this one ! . 
this wolfgang puck coffee tasted great the vanilla flavoring is just right some reviews said it was not so good , not enough flavoring , etc do n't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here i have never posted for a product and i have tried many different k cups this is a good k cup and do n't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback i almost hesitated and did n't buy it and then i figured i would give it a shot it was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor you will enjoy it it tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor . 
i saw the good reviews of this jamaica me crazy coffee , but the reviewers all seem to wander around whether it has coconut , vanilla , caramel , rum or coffee liqueur flavorings br br first off , i'm not getting any coconut from it at all some vanilla , but it mostly tastes like coffee with baileys irish cream in it br br in fact , after i drank a cup i had to go pick up my son from kindergarten and it occurred to me that some of the other parents might think i was drinking spiked coffee while we waited for the class to let out ! \) br br but its good i recommend it to anyone who likes flavored coffee not really anything else like it and i 've tried about 20 different k cup flavors . 
i used to do the subscribe and save with the timothy 's world kona , but due to the fact that the price on timothy 's jumped so high , i went to wolfgang puck breakfast in bed pleasantly surprised , and i must say that i like this one much better than the kona ! it seems much more smoother , but the taste still retains a nice warm mellow bold flavor great way to start the day ! oh , and i love the name of this coffee \) . 
i was n't expecting this one to be so rich or full ! yet it has a smoky finish that is typical of a french roast but does n't taste burnt i think alot of times a french roast tastes thin and yet bitter instead of full and smoky , but not this one ! very pleased with it and will definitely order again if you like a stronger cup in the morning , without being bitter , give this one a try . 
i am still waiting for peets to come out with kcups , but in the meantime , the wolfgang puck 's coffees are filling the bill i really like sorrento and rodeo drive smooth and full bodied br js . 
not too bold , not too weak not bitter good way to start if your not into the real strong coffees my husband and i have added the wolfgang puck breakfast in bed line and the rodeo drive flavors to our buying ritual . 
never had hawaiian hazelnut before so i did n't know what to expect , but it turns out it 's pretty good , not as flavored as say dd , but nonetheless pretty good i have it on subscription now along with the german chocolate cake , another one of my favorite flavored k cups . 
this has made me into a coffee lover ! very mild and easy on the stomach , but with a great flavor love it ! . 
nice , light cup of coffee definitely not a bold brew but it 's smooth and gentle on the stomach good for those mornings when you over did it the night before would buy again . 
this is a very balanced and smooth light coffee great for a first cup of the day . 
this is a great cup of hazelnut coffee smooth and balanced with no chemical aftertaste my husband and i like it so much that we 've ordered it twice directly from the keurig manufacturer so glad that it 's now available on amazon through subscribe and save ! . 
i'm amazed how many are being so easily fooled what you 're seeing is a generic ingredient list that covers multiple coffees what it is saying , based on the photo i see above , is that if the coffee type you have is straight coffee , then all it contains is 100 arabica coffee but if what you are drinking is a flavored coffee , then the ingredients in it are arabica coffee , and flavorings but if what you 're drinking is a decaf variety , then it contains arabica coffee that has been decaffeinated with ethyl acetate , as is standard br br so if you 're not holding a decaf variety , then there is no decaffeinated beans ! it is nothing more than generic catch all ingredients that apply to whichever variety you happen to be looking at br br sheesh think people ! lol . 
rodeo drive is my absolute favorite and i'm ready to order more ! that 's if i can find it br i do n't know why they are discontinuing it br it arrived very fast . 
honestly , i have to admit that i expected a little better that 's not to say that this is bad coffee in fact it 's quite bold without being too acidic , and pretty satisfying overall i think my main problem is that wolfgang puck 's name is attached to it , so perhaps it set my expectations a little high i have a wolfgang puck knife set that i adore , and is very high quality for what i paid for it this coffee was on sale , so it was well worth it also , i just hoped for something that would knock my socks off which it did n't i also purchased the breakfast blend , and jamaica me crazy at the same time the breakfast blend was the best , in my opinion , and the jamaican coffee smelled the best , but was the least successful . 
the breakfast in bed coffee from wolfgang puck is a good medium roast coffee my husband , the regular coffee drinker of our house , likes it , but feels he would like the coffee more if it were a bit stronger the product arrived quite soon after ordering . 
the wolfgang puck coffee , chef 's reseerve columbian decaf is fantastic and very delicious i definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a great cup of coffee . 
nice round flavor not harsh or botter i enjoy it with french vanilla creamer lately it has been harder to find i do hope they have not discontinued it ! . 
this is my wife 's favorite she grew up in seattle and has consumed countless gallons of various types of coffee in her lifetime so i assume this is good coffee she is also my wine taster as her palate is much more sensitive than mine . 
love this coffee , but cannot buy it through regular outlets , so am gouged by sasa corner really sticks in my craw paying more than a buck a cup . 
we were given a keurig for a wedding present , along with several variety packs so far , wolfgang puck 's jamaica me crazy is our favorite , and we will definitely be repeat buyers of this flavor . 
this is my favorite late evening cup of coffee nice flavor , just right before retiring for the night keep stocking this brand and i will keep coming back for it ! ! . 
it 's a great flavor and makes a great cup of coffee i fine you can have more than 1 cup of this coffee and not feel like it 's too much of a flavored coffee puck has captured a great flavor with this coffee . 
i love the wolfganag puck flavors this vienna blend is very nice it is medium roast so it is not too strong has a wonderful flavor without being a flavored coffee one of my favorites . 
we purchased an assorted package of k cups \( by various makers \) and of all the coffees this is my fave ! i really ca n't see any reason to ever taste test another flavor ! it smells delicious and tastes delicious too ! ! . 
never got a delivery as fast as we did this time we were running low on our special coffee we have sampled many k cup coffees , some in assorted packs and decided this is the best it is mellow , never bitter and always totally enjoyable . 
this is my second favorite after the breakfast in bed flavor i love wolfgang puck coffee it 's a little bolder then the breakfast in bed , but still smooth . 
this is our favorite k cup at home mellow and flavorful br br also , i wanted to clear up the question of whether or not this is decaf it is not see the response i received from wp coffee br br is breakfast in bed k cup actually a decaf coffee \? br br thanks for reaching out to wolfgang puck coffee the breakfast in bed is not a decaf blend br br thanks br mandy m br customer service br wolfgang puck coffee . 
the hawaiian hazelnut is my favorite k cup flavor from any vendor , but it 's always out of stock on amazon com it seems that all of the other puck flavors are available for a very reasonable 16 54 24 cup price and sold directly by amazon com , but hh 's price fluctuates wildly from 3rd party resellers and has n't been available directly from amazon com for months as i'm writing this \( 8 24 12 \) the price of a 24 pack is 34 99 from the cheapest 3rd party retailer , which is absolutely ridiculous amazon , why ca n't you stock the hawaiian hazelnut the same way you stock the other flavors \? \? the fact that i would take the time to write a review about this should tell you how much i like the product . 
this is just the perfect thing to end a tired day the taste is smooth and warm and creamy i find that i look forward to having a cup while i read for a few minutes what a treat . 
this is good vanilla coffee i got this and the green mountain and prefer this one it has a nice sweet flavor . 
wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut coffee for keurig brewer good medium strength coffee with hazelnut flavor full body , enjoyable anytime of the day i really like this coffee . 
i really enjoy wolfgang puck 's k cups , so far all the ones i 've tried have n't left my stomach churning and , br br this was my first time trying out the sorrento fair trade roast and purchased it on a warehouse amazon price deal i am really happy with my purchase the taste of the sorrento is what i would expect of a medium roast a good , smooth blend no bitter , acidic after taste , and leaves you wanting for more after that first cup ! \( at least , it left me \) ! p it 's does n't leave you with the shhhakes either , it has that right balance you need with your daily cup of coffee br br yes , i will be getting another 24 count of this when i am finished with this pack ! br br 5 stars ! . 
coffee quality is as good as expected but , close to expiring next time , i will spend the extra few dollars and buy the coffee localy . 
i'm a relative newcomer to keurig coffee , but i do know that i was generally disappointed in the drink produced however , the breakfast in bed k cup produces a nicely balanced , not too thin cup without being too harsh i still have n't achieved anything like what i can make either with my french press or with my drip machine , but it 's definitely better than the at work alternative , community coffee . 
if you like a balanced cup of joe , this is a great choice the coffee is smooth and balanced there is no bitterness or bite thank you chef puck for this fantastic decaf coffee choice ! . 
smooth with a hint of flavor medium boldness yet rich in taste not a wake me up but certainly enjoyable ! . 
my second purchase of this cofee like the first cup it has been wonderful to wake up to not too bold or brash but a good drink to start the day with . 
the best thing that i look foreward to every morning it makes my day , the best tasting coffee ever . 
i really enjoy this one and i 've tried many ! in my top 5 a little pricey but will order again sometime in the future . 
i too purchased this product thinking it might not be a flavored product , and before it arrived i looked it up to see that there was some rumor as to a coconut flavor br br so , lets get this out of the way do not purchase this is you do not like flavored coffee it is flavored br br the first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma , almost akin to hazelnut in its presentation the initial mouthfeel is good , a light roast but a snappiness to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor , which br has a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness br br the finish is semisweet chocolate , jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut br br bottom line if you like flavored coffee with coconut hazelnut cocoa profiles , you will like this coffee . 
jamaica me crazy is an awesome smooth coffee , light coconut vanilla flavorful taste br a good coffee if you do n't like real strong coffee highly recommend . 
i got one k cup of wolfgang puck 's colombian reserve dark roast as part of a variety 35 pack that i bought here on amazon since i 'd always assumed that i preferred the less burnt flavor of a light or medium roast , i was pleasantly surprised that i enjoyed the way this coffee sat on my tongue it is sweet , full , and gently bitter i brewed it in a 9 25 oz cup in an effort to dilute it a little , but i may be gutsy enough to try a 7 25 oz cup the next time around . 
smooth , delicious , ca n't wait to wakeup with my coffee ! i love all the wolfgang puck coffee flavors never a dull flavor ! . 
this is our first time trying the wolfgang puck coffee so glad we did ! ! ! it is a wonderful medium blend and great for any time of day ! i would buy it again ! . 
this is the best k cup coffee that we have been able to find very rich flavors and a medium roast we love this one ! . 
i'm not a huge flavored coffee fan usually i prefer lattes with flavored syrups a friend sent me a k cup to try and the smell was mouth watering before it even finished brewing the flavor was strong enough to drink it only with milk i added a little vanilla syrup when i reheated it i am not a coconut fan but the flavor is barely there it is just a unique taste for when you 're in the mood for something different ! . 
i loved this brand it was the best vanilla flavor of others i tried i would buy more if it was a better price . 
fantastic taste , smooth feel , no nasty aftertaste , pairs great with creamer what more can one want from a coffee \? this has become my favorite . 
best flavored k cup i 've ever had ! i recommend this for everyone great flavor ! i 've given it to all my friends and they get hooked . 
i did n't know what this would taste like , but i'm so glad i ordered it what a perfect cup of yummy coffee for a cool summer morning ! . 
wake up to a cup of wolfgang puck coffe breakfast in bed \( medium roast \) k cup for keurig is a great way to start your day , or just sit down and relax try it and you will be buying more br br shop amazon for wolfgang puck coffee , breakfast in bed . 
this is a favorite in the office and in my house we burn through this coffee i 've tried a few of the other wolfgang coffees and this one is by far the best i 've seen better prices for this at a lot of other places this is an excellent coffee to start your day with . 
i 've tried a wide selection of k cups including the big names like starbucks , tully 's , donut house , dunkin donuts , etc and they all have something in common either too watery \( weak \) or too bitter \( strong \) i tried breakfast in bed based on the reviews and i was not disappointed it 's flavorful without being strong or weak it 's hard to get a cup of coffee from a keurig that tastes like it was brewed like a normal coffee machine this k cup is the exception i 'll be stocking up . 
wonderful flavor would purchase this blend of coffee again light flavor not bitter at all and price was great the best i found anywhere . 
i find many of the k cups are a bit bitter for my taste i want something simple and smooth this coffee is wonderful ! . 
wolfgang puck 's colombian coffee is delicious ! i find it to be a smooth and flavorful dark roast with a lovely aroma , yet without a bitter or acidic quality that might leave an unpleasant aftertaste it is a bit expensive , like all k cups , but i think it 's worth it due to convenience and exceptional flavor i definitely recommend this coffee to others ! . 
not much of a coffee drinker but this wolfgang vienna brand is good not strong but a mellow taste the flavored coffees are getting on my nerves and this is just a good everyday coffee flavor everyone in the family and visitors like it would buy again . 
i truly enjoy a good cup of coffee it does give me a lift in the morning wolfgang puck really knows how to produce a fine cup thanks . 
great service and delivery for a really good product i am constantly looking for a good hazelnut coffee and so far this is the best , along with green mountain . 
my family is full of coffee snobs if you like robust coffee and use k cups , this is the product for you . 
while i love flavored coffees , i had never tried any of the wolfgang puck line this moved to the top of my favorites list with the first cup ! not only is the aroma delightful , the flavor is excellent as well i drink my coffee black and this one has no bitter after taste and the flavor is n't overpowering the flavor is a very light coconut and the coffee is a medium body i must admit that i was a little hesitant about a coconut flavor don't be ! everyone around me wants a cup i refuse to share ! .

i love the rich , full bodied flavor of a dark roast coffee when i bought my first keurig machine i wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast k cups that i could find i initially settled on newman 's own dark roast as my go to coffee , but i did n't stop there i like to keep experimenting and looking for something new i happened to find coffee people 's organic extra bold blend and was blown away it has been my favorite ever since i first tried it last week i saw a listing for a colombian dark roast sold under the wolfgang puck name \( it is processed and distributed by van houtte \) and decided to give it try here is my impression of it br br after brewing a cup \( i used the 7 1 2 oz setting \) the first thing that i noticed was that it did n't have that freshly brewed aroma that the coffee people x bold does , however the taste was another story it hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice , sharp bite that gets your attention right away the finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice \( nutmeg or cinnamon \? \) and just a slight , lingering , pleasant bitterness i really like this coffee but i think that i will stick with coffee people 's extra bold and this will be my back up brand however , i will keep looking for something new who knows what i will find \? br br a href http www amazon com gp product b001eo7gyy newman 's own iquest organics special blend \( extra bold \) , k cups for keurig brewers , 24 count , boxes \( pack of 2 \) a br a href http www amazon com gp product b002l444oq coffee people organic , extra bold k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 50 \) amazon frustration free packaging a . 
ok , now on our third box of breakfast in bed we had become fans of donut house and coffee shop , looking for that balanced smooth dunkinesque brew we found ourselves coming up just a bit short in the strength flavor area corrections were made in brew size and eventually adding in a bit of emeril 's bold or various dark roasts well problem solved with the b in b smooth and flavorful and a good eye opener \( was worried the name somehow implied less caffeine \) based on our experience in these areas , 5 stars the except \? on three seperate occasions out of two boxes purchased seperately , we had exploding k cups ! a small pop during brewing that sent coffee grounds spewing over and in the keurig , counter top , and coffee cup this at our home brewer and our vacation house messy very messy , requiring unplugging and careful cleaning inside cup holder and area minus 1 star umm , exactly who makes these things and where hopefully a road bump on the way to sucess peace . 
i have this flavor shipped automatically now , along with several others this happens to be our favorite , and i have to remind my husband the two boxes need to last until the next shipment a slight coconut aroma and flavor is so amazingly delightful in the morning not overly strong , and perfect for our taste buds our favorite part of waking up in the morning ! . 
first you must know i am one who roasts my own green beans at home , including sumatran , but also many african varieties i like a strong cup of coffee i use k cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing cleaning getting water for a regular machine br br sumatran coffees generally have a very rich , earthy taste some would describe it as being tangy almost having tried the two other main brands of sumatran for k cups , the puck is by far the best it is not as bold as something you would get from starbucks or from roasting yourself , but it has all the flavor elements of a good sumatran cup it especially has that nice earthy taste even the aftertaste is rich br br important if you are looking for a k cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting , this coffee is not for you in my opinion you get a sumatran because you love strong coffee watered down it loses its distinctiveness get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor i make mine with 2 k cups , at the smallest setting by camparison , i would give a starbucks sumatra mandheling a 10 10 rating for boldness the puck is about an 8 , the diedrich is a 4 br i highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers , provided you use the smallest cup setting you will not be disappointed best k cup i have had yet , and i have tried many newman , timothy 's , donut shop , diedrich , etc br br addendum i have since tried th green mountain sumatran , and gave that a one star stale and bitter i will definitely stay with puck 's . 
i bought a wolfgang puck sampler and this was certainly one of my favorites , so i ordered a bigger box and have truly been enjoying it this is a classic , medium roast cup of coffee it 's very smooth , with no bitterness i would say that if you enjoy donut shop , tully 's kona , and caribou , you will like this blend the label is adorable and makes me smile when i pop it in the keurig each morning . 
my favorite flavored coffee ! ! ! this is not available in any of my local stores better price than i have found at any local stores as well . 
been trying every coffee brand and flavor for over a year now and this is it i just love this coffee you should try a small box and see if you agree everyone has a different taste for coffee so you may not like it , but worth a try i always say if you don't buy a lotto ticket you will never win . 
if you liked flavored coffees , this one has a hint of coconut to it this is my favorite coffee by far i look forward to my first cup every morning . 
i love this coffee great taste and great way to start your morning if you like flavored coffee you will like this . 
these k cups are great ! the coffee is mild and yummy , but still very flavorful i love this , cant wait to get my next shipment ! . 
i caught this as a warehouse deal 18 09 for 48 k cups this was my first experience with any wolfgang puck coffee br the rodeo drive blend is good , average coffee nothing exceptional i prefer a little stronger , bolder coffee , but at this price , it works for me there 's other brands that i like a little better , but with k cups , cost per unit is always something i have to factor in br i 'd buy it again 0 38 cup , but i probably would n't full price if you keep your eyes peeled , you can always find a good deal just have to be patient and stock up when the deals arise . 
this is great coffee i am a coffee purist i do n't add cream or sugar \( unless it is weak or bitter \) i truly enjoy coffee i have tried many different types of coffee for k cups this is my new favorite the price was amazing too very smooth and subtle hazelnut flavor , not overpowering . 
well we were looking for another coffee that would meet or exceed the k cups we were using and this has far out tasted the coffee cups we were using , i have bought almost 6 packages of these and used just about all of them and will be ordering a few more boxes here soon great coffee , from a regular guy point of view . 
take it from someone who was tried a lot of different k cups , buy these ! the breakfast in bed blend is full of great flavor , roasted perfectly , and more importantly i have been choosing it over green mountain , which says a lot it 's true to its name , perfect for the morning . 
reading the previous comments people have stated they did not know this was a flavored coffee but it clearly states that it is atleast it did on the sight i bought mine from i was only brought to amazon for the secure payment feature it 's a delightful flavored coffee , \( depending on how you brew it \) , and is a pleasant wake up any morning . 
i did not know this had a coconut flavor or aroma as i got it in a variety pack i put it in this am and immediately smelled coconut and thought oh no i do n't like sweet in the am but its not sweet , i am quite surprised at the flavor and how i like it would i like it every morning no but it was a nice change made me feel i was waking up in a jamacian cottage on the ocean hearing carribean music , well maybe not but it was close . 
i have tried many different k cups and this has remained my favorite for the longest time it is the perfect balance , not too weak and not too bold and since i usually drink my coffee black , the flavor alone is very important to me it' has a great flavor and not too acidic . 
amazon had this as buy one get one free and since it was my favorite , i could not resist great purchase . 
this product is great tasting and you do n't even need sugar or creamer , but if you like sweet coffee i 'd say a little sugar and creamer would not hurt , this is a perfect product to wake up to every morning \) . 
this coffee is so smoothe i brew my morning cup with the medium cup size and it is delicious it is a little weak on the large cup size setting . 
this is a smooth not bitter coffee it 's a little more pricey than some which are just as good , but it has a good sweet flavor , and i can recommend it . 
i bought a small 3 pack of this locally and liked it so much i bought the 48 pack great deal on amazon . 
bought a sample pack today of the jamaica me crazy and love the flavor the flavor is not too powerful nor was it overwhelming i 'd recommend the wolf gang puck k cups . 
i personally do n't like strong coffee if you like weaker coffee , then this blend is a great choice for you other reviews on here say that its too weak , which is probably true if your used to something strong br br i also use flavored creamer to further enhance the taste for the price , it ca n't hurt to give it a try . 
this is the smoothest and best tasting keurig coffee i 've tried it 's not bitter , not too weak , not too strong , just right ! . 
these are awesome as are all of wolfgang puck 's k cups the coffee is smooth , the cups brew perfectly , the taste is unbelievable ! my husband and i are hooked on these the price is great considering what amazing coffee this is ! ! . 
wolfgang puck's french roast has a deep robust flavor i prefer it in the afternoon sometimes with a shot of gran marnier oh yeah . 
i 've tried every single french roast k cup , and this is one of my favorites the starbucks and the barista prima are the two best french roast k cups , but the gap between wolfgang puck 's and those two are negligible this one has that great sweet smoky flavor that every good french roast should have . 
this one is my wife 's favorite of all the hazlenut blends she has tried this is her go to after a busy day of being retired br delivery was exceptional as usual , could not ask for much more . 
my husband used to like the nantucket blend saying that it was awesome then he tried this one , and it 's the only one he drinks i drink other flavors , but i like taking sips of this one for sure my husband is very territorial over these cups and says it 's the only one he drinks if you 're a coffee drinker , definitely try this one ! . 
i drink my coffee black , so quality is a must ! this is an excellent medium roast with a smooth consistency and perfect amount of kick i love all the wolfgan puck coffee k cups , but this is absolutely my favorite ! . 
one of my top favorites , it 's infused with coconut and has a very unique flavor this coffee is best enjoyed without cream or sugar , and it will ether become one of your favorites or you 'll never buy it again some of my other favorites are vanilla biscotti , butter toffee , hawaiian hazelnut , and donut shop . 
i drink a lot of coffee and i buy several different types i found this particular one to be pleasant tasting with a nice aroma while brewing there is no after taste so you always want another cup . 
wonderful tasty coffee with a nice aroma as it is brewing there is no after taste at all and it very satisfying , you always want another cup of coffee i continue to buy it . 
a very nice flavor with no after taste it gives off a nice fragrance while brewing and has a very satisfying taste you have to have another cup ! . 
dark and full flavored , but distinctly columbian this is a great morning coffee better cup of am joe than you will get at a coffee place . 
there is so many different k cup to chose from so i asked in the store what brand and flavor is bought the most they suggested wolfgang puck coffee breakfast in bed the only had a few on the shelf and i was not disappointed now i am hooked for you people that use creamer , this coffee is so good you will not even need creamer . 
my favorite of the wolfgang series discovered when trying all of the flavors in the available sample pack very good flavor , consistent with each pod and not overdone with added flavors very good dark roast colombian cup of coffee from the wolf . 
we have tried all of the hazelnut flavored coffee brands this is by far the best to bad it is n't an auto ship . 
there 's not much i can say that has n't already been said but when i brewed this coffee i really was n't expecting to like it at all , seeing as i do n't normally like coconut flavored things but i really like the blend of flavors to me it does n't really taste like coconut as much as it does just tropical ness in general it 's like palm tree flavored coffee and the flavor is n't too overpowering at all , it still has a nice coffee taste it 's just right . 
this is a dark , smooth brew \( darker than timothy 's french vanilla \) , but as with timothy 's it has only a slight hint of vanilla this is my third taste test searching for the best vanilla flavored coffee gloria jean 's was undrinkable timothy 's was pleasant but not as deep a roast as this if it only had more vanilla flavor this would be my hands down favorite . 
i 've tried lots of flavors of coffee and this one is my favorite ! great taste , not bitter at all a great flavored coffee for people who do n't really like the taste of coffee . 
the aroma is awesome ! ! love the flavor , really gets you going in the morning prompt delivery , this is definatly my husbands favorite single cup coffee . 
after 5 years with the keurig , this is the best if you like a medium blend , it perfect its smooth , and has taste not watered down on either setting . 
i am not a huge morning coffee person as this seems to be the only time of day black coffee upsets my stomach no idea why my work got a keurig recently and buy the caribou regular and morning blends , which are ok but i can hardly drink them unless there 's a creamer of some sort in them br br so on a recent trip to bb b i perused their wall of k cups and this one caught my eye i am generally a fan of flavored coffees and this sounded good , so i bought an 18 cup pack i have to say it is delicious ! the coconut flavor is light but definitely there , and does n't leave a bitter aftertaste like most black coffees do it smells so good my co workers have done a 180 walking by my desk to ask me what smells so good br br obviously if you 're a coffee connoisseur this wo n't be for you , but if not it is definitely worth a shot and the best part for me , aside from the flavor , no stomach upset ! . 
wolfgang puck makes the best coffee ! the package arrived on time and in perfect condition ! i would definitely order this again . 
have enjoyed every single cup of breakfast in bed just the right kind of brew to wake up these old bones and get me started on the day 's adventure also enjoy it while watching ncis so i can join gibbs enjoying a brew as well . 
i love this brand ! the best hazelnut flavor ever ! i wait for it to go on sale because it is more expensive than the other brands also , as another reviewer noted , it does say decaff on the bottom of the package ! it really should state that in the product description i 've noticed the packages from bed , bath and beyond did not state this but ca n't imagine both are available i 'll still purchase it because the flavor is so smooth . 
i 've long been a fan of flavored coffees so when we got our keurig brewer we jumped on the opportunity to sample as many different flavors of k cups as possible our first foray into the single serve hazelnut world was a href http www amazon com gp product b0029xdzki gloria jean 's coffees , hazelnut k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers \( pack of 50 \) a , which was absolutely awful we 've always enjoyed hazelnut coffee in the past , though , and vowed not to give up i ordered a sample pack of wolfgang puck 's hazelnut directly from keurig 's website and hoped for the best br br thankfully , hawaiian hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water it is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming the hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut , which you 'd think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted , but we 've been disappointed in the past i 'd never tried coffee from the wolfgang puck brand before , but our positive experience with hawaiian hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties br br the hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied , which is nice , but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found this suits me just fine since i enjoy a milder roast , but people who enjoy their coffee strong and dark might not enjoy this blend as much br br we 'll definitely be repurchasing this coffee when we run out . 
i love this coffee it 's one of my all time favorites it has the best flavor and i like the light roast br br excellent ! ! ! ! . 
i love sumatra coffee and was excited to receive these k cups however was disappointed when i opened my amazon box and found that the plastic wrap holding the two boxes of k cups was full of grinds meaning that there was a possible blowout of a cup after carefully unwrapping the boxes and attempting to get as little coffee grinds everywhere as possible i opened the first box and all cups were fine , however the second box every kcup was covered in fine grinds and i had to clean each one and found that 3 of the cups were defective due to the top being stamped on at an angle and the grinds had spilled everywhere i now see other reviews stating they had defective cups as well however the taste of the coffee is good . 
truly not much needs to be said because it 's wolf and to wake up to his coffee here at the house is fantastic ! . 
i expected more flavor from w puck though this coffee does taste good , it did n't have caramel flavor as expected this is my opinion someone else may feel differently the price is okay , i would not discount this product at all it 's a good product try it , you may like it . 
i 've tried all vanilla coffee k cups and by far this is the best ! wolf gang puck vanilla francaise is a smooth vanilla experience that lasts way after the coffee is consumed try it you 'll love it ! . 
i am not a huge coconut fan , so i was n't excited about trying this , but with one sip it definitely won me over ! the flavor is perfect and is now one of the flavors in our regular rotation and it smells so good ! ! ! . 
this is my daughter 's favorite k cup product mild medium roast it is the next best thing to having wolfgang cooking breakfast for you in your kitchen . 
wow ! that 's what my husband said when he tasted wolfgang puck 's 'jamaica me crazy' coffee for my keurig he is not a fan of 'strong' coffees and he really liked this one we both do i highly recommend this one can you put it on the subscribe and save \? \? a href http www amazon com gp product b003vxl0v6 wolfgang puck coffee , jamaica me crazy , 24 count k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 2 \) a . 
i'm sure this flavor is n't for everyone , but if you enjoy your coffee on the sweeter and more flavorful side then you should enjoy this it is not what i would call a strong coffee by any means i would describe it as mild and flavorful . 
i just recently got a keurig coffee maker registered it online keurig sent me a coupon for buy 2 boxes , get 2 free awhile back , a local bagel shop had a coconut coffee that i fell in love with so , i decided to try this coffee out because it has coconut in it i brewed my first cup this morning it smelled very strong of coconut so of course i could n't wait to try it after it cooled down a bit i took my first sip amazing ! ! it is quite delightful i strongly recommend it if you like coconut coffee no bitter aftertaste , either no soot the bottom of my cup awesome . 
i was really impressed with this coffee , it has a nice bold taste , yet a smooth br finish i would order this coffee again . 
when i coulnd't find island coconut k cups anywhere , i found this and decided to try it although it is not exact , it is so close it puts a smile on face the coconut is not over powering , but you can taste the hint of it certainly i love this and would order again and again because this is available and island coconut is not ! ! . 
this is my absolute favorite coffee flavor out there ! i'm so glad it comes in k cups ! and i'm glad it is so inexpensive ! . 
i find this particular brand as good as the local coffee shop coffee \( d d \) which is a compliment to the maker i have made this particular brand my 1 choice . 
i have at least 4 dozen different k cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors my favorite is timothy 's rainforest espresso because i like a bold coffee but others that prefer something milder say that breakfast in bed is their favorite i like it to but only when made as a stronger brew i have purchased maybe 15 boxes of this since it came out . 
i normally drink only donut shop , but when i saw this on sale i thought i would give it a try i was quite impressed with it and really enjoy this one i have now added it to my list of favorite k cups to buy . 
i really like the flavor of this one ! it has a low acidity but still full of flavor ! now i have to have it every morning and i am having trouble finding another one i like this much . 
i'm actually suprised from reading some of the rants about this coffee i have tried 20 k cup varieties and this is by far my favorite contrary to some reviews , i do n't find it to be weak at all and in fact , is quite bold but with absolutely not hints of being bitter very smooth and leaves a great aftertaste i prefer really strong coffee and this is a good compromise for a medium roast as it 's not as bold as i would normally prefer but certainly strong enough to satisfy my preferences br br i typically drink wolfgang 's jamaica me crazy but ever since trying rodeo drive , i have n't gone back . 
i am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when i bought the sampler pack of jamaica me crazy i honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee the aroma that it gives off while brewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere the flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all a great new addition to my coffee line up . 
this is the best tasting coffee available on k cups ! ! ! ! the flavor is amazing , it is more expensive than other brands , but for a reason definitely worth trying . 
this is one of the best coffees i have ever had for my keurig it is a nice smooth coffee and the price is the best price i could find i will be buying more . 
my husband and i are obsessed with this coffee we take kcups and hide them around the house because we wanna make sure it lasts a long time ! such a bold and delicious flavor ! . 
i had tried this coffee before , it is wonderful smooth and rich , full flavored , but not too bold i would recommend it to anyone . 
it was a bit of a risk to order this , i mean what are you going to do with 2 boxes of kcups that taste terrible \? but this was delish , the flavor was really good , and it was still awesome after it had cooled down it has a coconutty , vanilla flavor , very nice ! ! . 
i like the jamaica me crazy better , but when it 's out of stock , this is my second choice br br it 's got a nice flavor strength , without being bitter . 
taste is a personal thing , is n't it so i 'll just tell you \( as a gauge \) my all time favorite k cup is timothy 's midnight magic a california roast \( which is dark \) i'm partial to dark roasts and probably would not have even bothered with this sorrento , but a friend had it , so i tried it , and lo and behold i'm very glad i did i find this blend even better than puck 's kopei ray which is his dark roast there 's a whole lot of good flavor here the word luscious comes to mind this one 's not available every where and comes at a slight cost premium i say it 's worth it these will be a regular for me ps a suggestion \( which seems apparent \) as with any k cup , when you try a new blend , use the plain old 1 cup setting to check it out undiluted the first time . 
this is my favorite kcup i 'd describe it as medium dark , creamy and rich and very consistent a lot of k cups seem acidic to me , so i'm really glad i found this one . 
very delicious coffee , thankfully amazon sells this flavor now i have been waiting for it since i tasted this last year i like the fact that you sell it in a 2 pack rather than a single . 
delicious coffee , good medium blend its hard to find something that isnt too weak or too bold with k cups , but this flavor was perfect will buy again . 
good flavor coconut flavor is subtle and not overpowering in comparison , there is another coconut coffee by green mountain in which the coconut flavor is overdone in my opinion . 
to me , this has a good , balanced flavor some flavored k cups seem too light on hazelnut , or too light on coffee this one is just right . 
this k cup actually smelled up the office and it tastes as good as it smells i found it to be very flavorful . 
i was surprised to find out the coffee from my sampler had coconut in it i bought a sampler of k cups to try different flavors and would sit aside the ones that i liked to order in the future br br after drinking jamaica me crazy not realizing the ingredients just knowing i liked it when ordering , reading through the reviews realized it had coconut in it and that was what made the taste so yummy , leaving me wanting more i was hesitant to buy but decided to go for it and am really glad i did everyone i have shared my coffee surprise with loves it too . 
light and flavorful definitely describes this k cup i often find it hard to find flavored k cups that are n't either 1 \) so strong you lose the flavor or 2 \) so light you 'd be better off drinking water however , i have to admit i have found a new favorite in the hawaiian hazelnut ! . 
i loved this coffee i just got my order a few days ago and i normally drink just one cup of coffee in the morning now i ca n't wait and have had an afternoon cup , too i must say i look forward to getting up in the morning just because i know i'm having this coffee ! ! taht says a lot for a lte sleeper ! ! try this one ! ! i like it on thenext to highest setting on my keurig it has an awesome aroma while brewing and the taste is smooth , never bitter and there is something that 'hints' of a slight fruitiness with the first sips then the end of the sip is just a perfect brew , too never any aftertaste or bitterness i am so happy to have found this ! ! thanks wolfgang ! i have now all of your kitchen gadgets cookware and now the coffee too ! . 
best k cup around a must try ! amazon ships quickly and in one piece i 'd recommend the coffee as well as going through amazon to order this coffee from thank you for a great experience . 
usually do not get the breakfast blends but it was on sale and decided at price would try it out it was not as weak as some breakfast blends tend to be not bad . 
wolfgang puck definitely has the best coffee for the money i absolutely love the french vanilla the kcup actually makes a good full cup of coffee it could be a tad stronger but overall it is really good i still prefer the senseo pods to the kcups though . 
jamaica me crazy has a slight overtone of cinnamon that is a very nice compliment to the taste of coffee the flavoring is strong enough to taste , not just smell , without overpowering the flavor of the coffee very good . 
i drink my coffee with a splash of half and half other hazelnut k cups are too bland for me i much prefer wolfgang puck 's excellent rich roast with definite but not overpowering hazelnut flavor . 
definately not what i 'd expected with the wolfgang puck name on it to me , wolfgang puck has conotations of a heavy , dark roast european style coffee i thought i 'd already found my perfect coffee in a href http www amazon com gp product b001d0gv68 timothy 's world coffee , breakfast blend for keurig brewers , 24 count k cups \( pack of 2 \) a but this one edges it out smooth and balanced it really is great from the first sip till the last drop br br there will never be a coffee that all coffee lovers will agree on but if you like a light medium roast , give the breakfast in bed blend a try very low in acidity , someone who ca n't tolerate the acidity in coffee may be able to enjoy this blend but , be aware and contrary to popular belief , light roast coffee is typically higher in caffine than the dark roast coffees , the extended roasting to produce a dark roast burns away some of the caffine this one will definately get you going in the morning in a good way br br those who prefer a dark roast or extra bold should probably look elsewhere . 
this coffee says medium roast but is actually a little stronger we loved it and it has become our favorite if you want some coffee to caffeine you up , this is the one for you ! ! also , wolfgang puck 's breakfast in bed is great not so strong ! . 
i ca n't remember when i 've had a cup of coffee so delicious , i immediately wanted another cup there is no bitter taste , no funny chemical taste you get with so many flavored coffees , no odd aftertaste it 's just a mellow , gorgeous , hazelnut with a touch of the islands cup of coffee outstanding my favorite i 've ever tried , and i 've tried most ! . 
this is very good coffee , but it does n't have as much flavor as the van houttes creme caramel if your looking for something that has a lot of flavor , go with the other if you are looking for something that is more coffee than flavor , this is it . 
by far , this is the best flavored k cup coffee i 've ever had good body , not bitter , no flowery aroma \( like with the green mountain flavored k cups \) i like my coffee a little stronger than puck 's hawaiian hazelnut , but it is certainly a fine , medium bodied , coffee i could drink over and over . 
these k cups are wonderful ! we were pleasantly surprised with the low acidity and smooth flavor ! the rodeo drive k cups are on our top five k cup list ! . 
while looking for a top rated vanilla k cup , i stumbled upon this combination flavored cup that was rated higher than any of the vanilla flavored cups at that time i took a chance and ordered a double pack from amazon and was pleasantly surprised this is a rich tasting medium light roasted flavor that appeals to several coffee drinkers at our house there is a hint of built in sweetness so that additional sweeteners are not necessary for those of us who do n't care for super sweet coffee i would classify this as a medium roast and tastes best with the medium sized cup selections on our keurig coffee brewer a href http www amazon com gp product b000gtr2f6 keurig b 70 b70 platinum single cup home brewing system a people who prefer extra bold coffees would need to use two of these k cups to make one extra large travel mug of coffee br that said , we have found that mixing this flavor with other flavors to make an extra large serving is a most enjoyable pastime at our house the most popular combo 's so far are jamaica me crazy with a href http www amazon com gp product b00395dvqs van houtte french vanilla k cups for keurig brewers , 24 count boxes \( pack of 2 \) a , hazlenut a href http www amazon com gp product b00395574m van houtte hazelnut decaffeinated k cups for keurig brewers , 24 count boxes \( pack of 2 \) a or costa rican a href http www amazon com gp product b001hkzz4i van houtte caf eacute , costa rica tarrazu \( light roast \) , 24 count k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 2 \) a in the end , this is one of the most versatile flavors for those of us who have frequent visitors and several palettes to please . 
bought this during one of amazon 's friday sales did not find too many reviews since these are fairly new took a chance and am very pleased we like our coffee rich and strong and this one delivers great tasting dark roast coffee ! . 
this coffee is surprisingly delicious we never had a problem with the k cups bursting maybe it is a defect on the coffee brewer \? this coffee is a bit less strong than we normally prefer our coffee but it makes up with great taste look forward to my mug every morning would definitely recommend it and will buy it again . 
exact same as the ones bought at the store only a lot cheaper recommended for any keurig drinkers out there . 
this is my 1 favorite coffee blending of hazelnut and coconut are perfect thank you ! ! br br question why was i charged postage on this brand when i have never paid on any other brand of k cups from amazon . 
if you like your keurig you need to try this k cup smooth taste with just a slight hint of flavor not overwhelming like some brands my new favorite . 
this is our favorite k cup coffee , it is strong and taste great \( although it seems that many of the k cups \) have nearly the same overall taste . 
this is a good tasting k cup from a guy who drinks coffee black and prefers a bold , full flavored taste i would recommend . 
i love using k cups ! although i have tried so many bad coffees i have finally hit on one dark roast coffee that is n't bitter and has a wonderful flavor you do n't have to try them all , this is a perfect blend coffee . 
ok so this is the best flavored coffee ever no after taste that seems to always occur w flavored coffees its not even really flavored , it has hint of coconut taste but it really still tastes like coffee just the best coffee ever mmmmmm add honey yummy ! ! ! ! ! br highly recommend ! . 
wolfgang puck k cups are under the radar their coffees are smooth and delicious and jamaica me crazy is my fav and the best coconut flavored coffee on the market island coconut is quite poor in comparison . 
i 've always hated the peete 's or starbucks burnt bitter taste this is a great blend , still strong without the burn roasting br br fyi , low quality beans are burned to hide it 's bad taste . 
i like the darker roast coffees and this fits the bill this is every bit as good as deidrich and tulley 's but typically costs more i guess wolkgang wants a cut if you catch it on sale , buy it . 
it was as good , if not better , than i was told ! great taste ! i will puchase it again . 
this is an excellent full bodied coffee without a bitter taste in general the wolfgang puck coffees are quite good although a little more expensive than some of the other k cups . 
as always , i love this coffee , it 's about the only kind i buy for myself the turn around time is terrific when i have about a week 's worth of cups left , i order and have the next batch in perfect timing very happy with everything about this product . 
this coffee is a smooth , yet robust taste that does not have any bad after br taste a href http www amazon com gp product b003vxjj28 wolfgang puck coffee , rodeo drive blend \( medium roast \) , 24 count k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 2 \) a . 
i have tried many brands of medium roast coffees however , this is my favorite some i 've tried are bitter some are too light some are too strong but this one for me is just right ! some brands more than others come in all puffed up and when punctured , the grounds filter out into the needle of the keurig coffee maker and has to be cleaned which is n't difficult , just annoying never had a problem with these breakfast in bed k cups are smooth , not too light and not too strong , right smack in the midddle no bitter after taste either and perfect any time of day enjoy ! . 
sometimes we have a problem ordering the k cups because they are way too strong for us even if you order medium blend this coffee was great just right ! it was a smooth blend , and was perfect for a morning cup of coffee or anytime ! would definitely order again ! . 
good description of this product has the over roasted popular coffee flavor , but , not overpowering one of my favorites so far . 
i ordered this by accident and i'm so happy i did this is a new favorite of mine it 's nice and strong without being bitter . 
note this one is better for me at the smallest cup setting , which makes it stronger br br this is my first time to try wolfgang puck coffee i have mixed feelings about it so far the rodeo drive blend is a little more 'bland' than i'm used to , which is great for people who prefer that it 's just a different taste , which is good or not so good , depending on each person 's preference personally , ever so often i take a sip of rodeo drive blend and think that it almost tasted like dishwater then that goes away and i enjoy the rest of the cup of coffee i think that reaction is because it is n't as strong and bold as i'm used to , but it 's pretty good i can see that some people might make this their favorite because it is different br br will i buy this again \? no it 's good , but it 's not my preference , and i might as well buy the ones that make me rave on and on about how good they are , usually tully 's french , kona , italian , and house those may be too strong for some people , and the rodeo drive blend does have its own unique taste which may really appeal to some coffee drinkers as with most things , actually a little more than in most things , with coffee , it 's a matter of taste and probably a matter of what you are in the habit of drinking you may want to try this one , especially if you can find it in a sample packet , or do like i do , keep the rest for guests to try . 
my friend says she loves this coffee and has never been able to find it in the local stores where we live aha , she did not know that amazon sells just about anything you could want no tax and free shipping what could be better . 
hazelnut being the household favorite favorite , i thought i 'd give these k cups a try the flavor is smooth and delightful i suggest trying this brand for your k cup machine ! . 
this is good , but could be a bit stronger in the hazelnut flavor it is good though and i would purchase it again . 
i love jamaica me crazy coffee this version is flavorful , the price is pretty good , and it sure beats the office pot coffee that sits on a burner for hours fresh coffee , fast ! . 
this coffee has become one of my daily favorites it 's not quite as strong as many of the french roasts , but it 's also not as bitter a good way to start the day . 
this is my favorite so far amongst the wolfgang puck k cups the word that comes to mind when i sip it is bright it has a natural sweetness and good flavor , without being overly heavy the packaging lists it as a medium roast , but i 'd put it more towards the light end of the spectrum it 's a very enjoyable cup , and i 'd recommend if you are looking for something to switch up with green mountian 's popular vermont country blend or breakfast blend br br i generally have n't been impressed with the wolfgang puck flavored varieties \( vanilla francaie , jamaica me crazy \) , but this regular cup is quite good . 
i have had all of the various keurigs since they came on the market for home use thus , i have tried pretty near all of the various k cups this is one of my top 5 favorites love the coconut in it , and the wonderful coffee flavor yum ! ! ! ! . 
this coffee was not what i expected but enjoyed it greatly i was looking for a stronger vanilla flavor but after trying it i enjoyed it a lot it was light and smooth and left no aftertaste i would recommend this to others . 
i like columbian coffee and this is above average with a good dark color with a nice smell the taste is bolder than average but not unpleasant or bitter this is my strong columbian coffee combining all the good things of the type with a bolder taste . 
smooth i normally drink dark roasts but purchased this on a lightning deal \( or maybe a friday sale \) i like it . 
i 've tried every bold k cup and this is one is one of my favorites very nice flavor and strength . 
we have a keurig coffee maker one of the side benefits is the opportunity to experiment with different k cups i have already tried half a score some seem pretty tasty at first until one taste something that is even better some early k cups that i graded highly do n't compare too well with later brands that i have tried br br wolfgang puck 's columbian dark roast noir is one of the better products that i have tried it has a bold taste , although not strongly so it is also smooth tasting br br it is now on my short list of possibilities for my first morning cup of coffee so , i am pretty happy with wolfgang puck 's product here . 
this is my favorite coffee flavor and i have not had it in a long time forgot how delicious it was until we ordered the k cups love them , already ordered more . 
we 've only been using the k cups about 2 months both my wife and i like our coffee bold i 've been guided by amazon reviews and started out with coffee people 's jet fuel although that is still my favorite , i got this french roast on a friday sale and would say that it 's my new second choice i have also tried coffee people 's black tiger \( a close third \) and kona \( not a fan \) this is a nice , well rounded every day cup , more on the bold side but not wincingly so . 
i bought this coffee for my keurig coffee maker and i really like it smooth and the best thing it is an organic wolfgang uses the the best beans for his coffee 's buy you will be pleasantly surprised . 
great tasting coffee strong , but not obnoxiously strong and no nasty aftertaste too bad , it cannot be purchased on subscribe and save anymore . 
this is the best all around 1st cup in the morning coffee ever ! i love it perfect flavor . 
by far the tastiest coffee i have purchased from amazon sorry it is n't in the shop and save any longer delicious ! ! ! . 
love this blend , so was delighted to find it on your subscribe save program \( at a better price br than w keurig so really disappointed to learn today it was no longer available on said program br shame on manufacturerer ! . 
i have tried about 25 different k cup flavors , and this is my favorite it has a wonderful aroma , and just the right amount of hazelnut use the subscribe option , and this is a deal that ca n't be beat . 
i buy these with subscribe and save i like the flavor and aroma going on month two and i am not tired of them yet ! . 
i was very excited when i received a keurig coffee maker as a christmas present , could n't wait to put it to use however , in the three months since i 've had it , i have struggled to find what i think is a good cup of coffee most of the brands i 've tried have either been too weak or too strong br br i am not a starbucks kind of coffee drinker , or fan of fancy flavored coffees i just like a regular cup of coffee that smells good when it 's brewing , tastes smooth when i drink it finally , just like goldilocks said , this one is just right . 
one of the weaker flavored coffees but a yummy one almost no need for milk as it is already creamy tasting . 
this coffee is awesome kinda bold , with a sweetness excellent my son says with international 's carmel macchiado creamer you can find in the dairy section . 
the coffee was great spent some time in jamaica and got to love the coffee nice to get in back home as well . 
i got this with the purchase of 24 different bold coffee k cups to find the ones i like best , and so far this is my favorite it may not be bold enough for some , but it is not supposed to compete with the 'extra bold' varieties this was smooth and not nearly as bitter as many bold coffees so many bold blends have a 'burned' flavor , leaving a bad taste in your mouth , this one was strong without the bad aftertaste , perfect for me ! . 
i like full bodied coffee and to try something different to supplement the standard one i use this coffee was perfect for that purpose timothy 's rainforest expresso is still my standard one but i will order this again . 
creme caramel is by far my newest favorite ! great coffee flavor , not too weak , with a wonderful caramel aroma ! . 
i drink alot of coffee and love hazelnut coffee , this brand has the best flavor i have ever tasted i have bought several different brands and this one is the best ! it may be a few dollars more but it is worth it i absolutely love and enjoy it every morning . 
my favorite , i have it auto shipped through amazon the only problem i have is i drink way too much coffee now because i like it so much . 
this is one of my favorite k cups it 's a rich dark coffee without the bitterness of some highly recommended . 
this is my favorite of the flavored coffees i am not usually a fan of coconut but this coffee is deliciously coconutty chocolaty ! love it ! . 
yummy , mild , and delicious my new favorite ! mild in comparision to coffees called rocket fuel and taste like motor oil , but truly a medium roast pleasant in the morning makes you glad to have a good cup of coffee . 
wolfgang puck coffees are great and the creme caramel is one of my favorites i would recommend this coffee for people who like a mild flavor . 
i thought that because of the name attached that i would be wow ed its just a good average coffee nothing spectacular . 
i prefer mild to medium coffee and i 've tried so many different k cups but i 'll stay with this one the other reviews were right on , smooth and not any bitterness just a great cup of joe with amazon prime it came super fast , if you 're not a prime member i strongly recommend it . 
i am having a blast with my new keurig machine trying out a bunch of new flavors including the dark roast it 's nice and flavorful particularly since i run each of my cups through the small cup brewing cycle 2 times to fill my large mug this works br tried the chocolate donut flavor the other day and loved it br love the convenience and bargain prices of the subscribe save . 
i am impressed with mr puck 's different blends , this one is a favorite of ours it lives up to the medium roast name , full bodied , not acidic and smells great while brewing , will buy again . 
great deal great turnaround ! what a difference from other orders i have placed with other vendors ! got the package the day after i ordered it ! . 
if you like vanilla flavored coffee , this is it ! ! i put a french vanilla creamer in and no other sweetner is needed i have it every day and i 'll always order ahead so i do n't run out . 
this coffee is bold and none of the bitterness that is usually found in bold coffee 's it also scored exeptional in the single serve coffee ratings and i concur there is a lot of dreck out there in k cups , this and wolfgang puck 's hawaiian hazelnut are great ! . 
very smooth and flavorful for a medium roast i was pleasantly surprised by this k cup and would get it again the 25 off deal drew me to it and i'm glad . 
this is my favorite of all the coffees i 've tried smooth and flavorful without being a flavored coffee , its a definite treat anytime of day . 
this is about the strongest k cup i 've purchased i like my coffee strong , and before buying a k cup coffee maker , always purchased french roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee brewing this in a k cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee since i brew a cup for my wife and i at the same time , i run two 8 ounce cups with one of these k cups into a small decanter , and then pour into two coffee cups , which still yields a strong flavor , but not enough pop your eyeballs out br br of course , brewing two cups with one k cup drops the price down in half , which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of k cup brewing i find most k cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup , and 16 ounces would weaken them too much but this works for my wife and i since i have been fixing a cup for each of us for years , and brewing two cups with one k cup is economical . 
i want this coffee in bed every morning , just like it 's name breakfast in bed i ordered this 24 2 box shipment on the automatic 2 months plan i used it up way before the next shipment so i changed the plan to every month now is looks like it 's out of stock ugh i hope it comes back soon it is a delicious choice ! . 
this product takes getting used to only after using about 3 k cups did i start liking it however , i would n't buy this many again . 
i'm loving this coffee ! ! it 's smooth and bold but not too bold it reminds me of starbucks coffee but not as bitter very very very good cup of coffee give it a try i'm really glad i did . 
until i tried vienna coffee house , donut shop was the one i had on automatic monthly delivery vienna coffee house is a tad bolder than donut shop but very smooth without any bitterness from the first cup , i knew i had to switch . 
of all the k cups i have purchased so far , i like this french roast the best it has a really bold taste even used with the large cup button i like other coffee selections too , but this one really stands out br br i consider myself an early adapter and the keurig coffee machine is one of my best purchases although the coffee is somewhat expensive at 40 50 a cup , there is no waste , no pot cleanup , and , best of all , great coffee i usually get up earlier than the rest of the household and can have my great coffee almost instantly without making a full pot that can go sour before all being drank br br i notice that regular retailers such as target and grocery stores are now carrying k cups , but buying online costs less and is more convenient pjs . 
i do n't drink a lot of flavored k cups , but people have been raving about wolfgang puck 's k cups , so i gave this a try it 's definitely a good quality flavored coffee with a medium body overall , i have enjoyed several cups of this and have temporarily shelved my timothy flavored k cups in favor of this one i sometimes add sugar free vanilla syrup , cream , and cinnamon it 's excellent that was in place of dessert i also tried caramel syrup added to this do n't do it it overwhelms the flavor . 
i love coffee with no bitterness and lots of good coffee taste and this one fits the bill holds up well to milk sugar i love it in the morning for the first cup and in the evening just as much definitely would buy it again . 
i love , love , love , this coffee it 's easy on my stomach yet it has a rich medium roasted flavor which , in my opinion is not bland at all it 's such a delicious cup of coffee i have told everyone about these , i 've even converted green mountain lovers over to wolfgang puck rodeo drive brand if you like your coffee fully flavorful and delicious , but not too robust or bold , this coffee is for you i have tried many k cup brands , tully 's , green mountain , emeril 's , donut shop , etc and this brand is equal to green mountain , possibly even a bit better \) . 
this is a fantastic decaf coffee my parents love decaf but there are n't many out there they enjoy we 've been drinking timothy 's decaf colombian and we bought this to try it fantastic ! i would definitely buy this again and again it 's smooth and not bitter it 's not super strong so do n't expect it to be like a cappacino this is a really great colombian cup of coffee you wo n't miss the caffiene . 
i like my coffe of the milder but tasteful side i thought this was a great cup of coffe i compare it to timothy 's dounut shoppe full flavor but not acid this is for people who want a lighter cup of coffee . 
jamican me crazy is the best coffee it is not too strong and has a unique taste no complaints here highly recommend it . 
this not only tastes great but has the best aroma while brewing subscribe and save is the way to go . 
trying out different pods and this is a delicious one service was excellent no hassle at all will buy from again . 
i was n't sure what to expect with the wolfgang puck coffees , but i am pleased br br the sorrento is a good medium roast it is a bit darker of a roast than some of the other mediums out in keurig land , but it is n't bitter there 's just a little of something chocolatey in the flavor br br my only complaint is that this coffee , like most of the keurig cups that do n't say extra bold on them , they brew up pretty weak if you do a larger mug i typically brew the 9 25 oz size , and on these guys i bumped it down to the 7 25 oz size if i brew it in the larger cups , it just comes out too weak br br if you are one who feels that k cups usually make weak coffee , you will think that these are really weak , and be tempted to brew 'em two at a time this coffee is not plain or unflavorvful there 's just less coffee in the k cup \( or rather the normal , not extra bold amount \) , so it brews up weaker . 
i like this coffee , its nice to drink it in the morning it has medium body and full flavour goes great with raw sugar and splash of non fat milk . 
i'm a sucker for caramel anything love the flavor , the aroma , and most important the taste i honestly do not like flavored coffees in the morning , but i have made an exception for this one ! . 
i am trying many different coffees to see which one 's i like best this coffee was good , but a little stronger than i had expected i know it say 's extra bold , but others i 've tried have not been that extra i ended up putting it on my larger cup setting and it was perfect then there was a little after taste , but not much more than other coffees i would recommend it if you like stronger coffees , but it is not as strong as an espresso i intend to purchase this again . 
i like a dark rich coffee and this is a tad different it seems much smoother and br i tend to nearly crave it when i have a slightly acid stomach it sounds odd and br i know i drink too much coffee but this fills that acid tummy niche . 
tried this for the first time this week and it is now my favorite coffee with a hint of flavor \( coconut \) full bodied , and no after taste , jamaica me crazy is just what i love for an afternoon pick me up , or to wake up and have an immediate smile on my face seriously it 's awesome ! highly recommended . 
wolfgang 's reserve columbian decaf is probably the best decaf we have had in a k cup very good cup of coffee ! . 
this is a coffee that i look forward to drinking as soon as i wake up ! very nice . 
light vanilla favor not overpowering nice coffee , the first box that was purchased was too light on the vanilla flavor and aroma surprisingly the 2nd box was much better one of my new favorites . 
we love our keurig coffeemaker and have tried many coffees recently discovered wolfgang puck 's new line of coffees and are pleased with all of his we have tried this one is smooth with a great flavor , no bite we would purchase this again . 
this is a mild but delicious coffe some might say a dessert coffee i really liked it as a pleasant change from full bodied flavors . 
was looking for a strong k cup that could hold up for the perfect espresso and for a great cup of coffee ! now receiving on auto ship , if you 're looking for a great bold k cup , this is it . 
i read several great reviews on this coffee on another site and decided to give it a try it 's now one of my favorites and i will be ordering it again the taste is great , sweet but bold enough that i can do a large size and it still have flavor . 
great coffee has a nice bold taste for a medium roast coffee this is my new favorite give it a whirl . 
i bought a two pack at the friday sale for 20 reasonable , but not an amazing deal i 've been pleasantly surprised by the taste i do like the van whatever flavor french vanilla k cups , and this contains significantly milder flavoring of a good tasting coffee br i would and have served it to company and highly recommend serving with milk or cream br br if you like flavored coffees , you 'll most likely enjoy this one if you like it plain and black , you 'll probably hate this . 
nice medium coffee blend that has a hint of vanilla and a touch of sweetness if you like a href http www amazon com gp product b001hwi700 emeril 's vanilla bean bam ! , medium roast coffee for keurig brewers , 24 count k cups \( pack of 2 \) a or a href http www amazon com gp product b001chj03i gloria jean 's coffees , cappuccino for keurig brewers , 24 count k cups \( pack of 2 \) a , you should like this blend br br i drink this as an afternoon or dessert coffee with a splash of milk and a sugar packet br br 4 stars because i would like just a touch more vanilla flavor br br 1 21 11 we ordered another box of this coffee and the vanilla flavor seemed to be a little stronger than our first box . 
i found the taste and strength of this coffee just right for it to gain the honor of one of my go to coffees for my keurig not too strong or bitter , i rather enjoy the flavor sadly with the recent k cup coup staged by green mountain coffees , it looks like amazon is n't carrying the wolfgang puck coffees any longer and my subscribe and save \( and my business \) will need to go elsewhere definitely give this coffee a shot if you can . 
love this coffee ! the aroma is as delicious as the flavor my husband would typically have a cup of coffee once or twice a month , now he 's having a cup several times a week . 
it is a medium roast pleasant coffee , comparable to green mountain 's breakfast blend i bought it with a very good deal though . 
simply awesome i love bold coffee and love french roast brews this is a truly wonderful fr blend dittos for deidrich fr , both are awesome br br i also tend to like the bold coffee people kcups most all i 've tried have been bold and flavorful , each with it 's own distinct flavor . 
i got the coffee for 12 50 per box ordered 4 boxes ! ! such a great deal , as the coffee is a great blend br br if anyone is upset because of the website having issues when they were trying to buy it , they should n't review the product poorly , as it is not the product that is the problem br br the problem is that you 're jealous you did n't get such a great deal on the coffee grow up kids , this coffee is great ! ! ! will buy from amazon com , llc again for more k cups for my keurig br br all of my coffee arrived packaged well and in new condition , nothing wrong with it ! ! . 
highly recommended for those who appreciate a good dark roast coffee , wolfgang 's sumatra kopi raya excites the flavor buds and ignites one 's morning always a good start to any day . 
definitely not extra bold medium roast at best not particularly memorable does n't have a good coffee aroma but it 's pretty decent tasting at this point i'm not sure if i would reorder . 
i'm not a coffee snob if i was , i doubt i 'd own a keurig i just want a decent tasting cup of coffee with little cleanup br br i 've tried many of the flavored coffees , but they 're too gimmicky for me starbucks brand tastes burnt to me , even their blonde roast in stores i mean , i have not tried the starbucks brand kcups br br i like this breakfast blend because it 's not too dark , not too light it tastes like what no frills coffee should taste like i order the biggest size to get the best value br br update i just tried to create a review for the jamaica me crazy coconut flavor , which i thought was terrible \( and i love coconut \) i should specify that the original review was for breakfast in bed . 
i do like this coffee , but even with subscribe and save , amazon 's price is higher than k cups at bed bath beyond convenience is one thing , but since there are bb bs all around me , it 's pretty easy to pick up my coffee there and save a few bucks i wish amazon would price their coffees more competitively i 'd buy here exclusively if they did but this is good , medium roast coffee not quite as strong as i 'd like , but a little stronger than the breakfast in bed version i may need to try sorrento and see if it 's a little bolder . 
my favorite k cup so far absolutely no aftertaste , which in my book is a huge plus it 's not acidic , not bitter , just a great mild cup of coffee , which is exactly what it purports to be ! i wish other people would read the description before they give a bad review based on their own stupidity do n't buy a medium roast coffee and complain because it 's not bold ! also , as a general rule the ones with breakfast in the name are milder i do n't care for bold , dark roast , slap you awake coffee so i would n't buy a bold coffee and then complain that it was bold . 
i 've read so many reviews on the many brands and varieties of k cups coffee preferences are so subjective i did like the flavor of this coffee bold but not bitter as to strength i wish that there was more coffee in each k cup i am accustomed to starbuck 's strength , and i have to set my keurig to medium cup size to get the strength i need this is not as cost effective as say jet fuel \( but i found jet fuel too bitter \) br if wolfgang puck would add more coffee to its k cups , this would be a perfect coffee for me . 
this coffee has a very tropical taste to it , so it 's perfect for iced coffee on a hot day the flavor is not bad when heated , but it just seems a little odd br br you do n't usually think of tropical beverages being hot . 
we have been enjoying our order of w puck sumatra kopi raya dark roast coffee k cups for the last week we find the delicious flavor very satisfying not so strong to be bitter , and not so weak as to taste like colored water the coffee is perfect there is just the right amount of heartiness to make it an enjoyable coffee experience , and it carries a nice lingering pleasant flavor and aroma it is not as strong as an espresso , but maybe one step below like we said , pleasant , smooth , and flavorful ! . 
i am not a fan of any of the decaf k cups i have tried but this one is probably the best i like strong coffee and his comes pretty close to what i would expect although it says medium roast . 
i was intrigued how this particular blend got such an exotic name , and i was n't disappointed there is an ever so slight coconut aftertaste that makes this so delicious , i do n't like strong coffee , and this is perfect for my husband and i i get it send regularly now and it 's one of our favorites ! second only to jamaica me crazy by wolfgang puck wolfgang is much tastier than the other brands . 
i tried this coffee on a half dozen quests this weekend and they all loved it for those that like their coffee mild , i brewed 7 oz cups for those of us that like it bold , i brewed 5 oz cups br br as an earlier posted noted , it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees the taste is n't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee regular and black but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention br br i plan on trying all of wolfgang 's line wish he 'd offer a variety pack . 
i just got my box today and brewed a cup after work it 's one of my favorite k cups yet ! ! i recommend it smooth , does n't taste watered down , and no bitter aftertaste the cups also look pretty in my k cup rack \) . 
wolfgang puck 's hawaiian hazelnut is the best k cup hazelnut and i have tried them all we ordered this large pack , because we sadly found out that wolfgang puck is discontinuing many \( not all \) of their k cups , including this flavor buy this while you can ! . 
so far , of all the decaf kcups we have tried , this is our favorite wish it were on the automatic ordering system coffee is such an individual like or dislike but when we use it with an 8oz cup of water it is great . 
i bought the kuerig because i love the dunkin original and green mountain nantucket blend rodeo drive has now become my favorite it is very delicious and smooth . 
when i feel that i do not need more caffine , i have found that the wolfgang puck decaf is a great substitute i really ca n't tell the difference , taste wise i had been having trouble finding a good decaf i think this one is it . 
sometimes i feel when i reach for a decaffeinated k cup that i'm going to settle for less flavor however , i'm completely happy with this product i do n't feel i'm missing anything everyday i treat myself to a relaxing cup of coffee after work before starting dinner this product just fits what i'm looking for . 
i got a 5 k cup sample box of this coffee from keureg , and i find that it is my favorite decaf coffee it brews a smooth tasting cup of coffee every time i add some 1 2 1 2 and a bit of equal , and it is a treat any time br glad to have found this coffee . 
wolfgang puck coffees are very good this particular flavor of decaf is delicious does n't taste like decaf at all , very rich flavorful also , this was a very good value for the price i 've recommended this product to several friends . 
my wife and i have decided hands down , this is our favorite k cup we 've tried a lot of others , and donut shop and caribu daybreak are certainly still up there however , this has a very solid body flavor with a medium roast almost a bold flavor with a smooth finish excellent flavor versus strength really nice to get up on a lazy sunday morning and have a nice cup of breakfast in bed ! br br also , i see another reviewer had problems with messy k cups i can say after about 6 boxes of theses , i have n't had any issues very unfortunate for the other reviewer , but looks like it was rather isolated br br give it a try , you 'll certainly enjoy it , the wife and i sure do ! . 
i am usually a non flavored coffee drinker , but i do like to mix things up every now and again this is a lightly coconut flavored coffee the coffee itself is a medium brew and it goes well with the tropical undertones of the coconut it is a nice summer drink . 
i love quite a few coffees but this one is grabbing my whole households attention it 's not bitter but it 's not light either it 's perfect i love it . 
i switched to decaf and was looking for a decent cup on the keurig machine i was only interested in subscribe and save options br br this is a fairly light roast , which i like i brew on the middle setting and i think if it was brewed any larger i would think it was too light . 
absolutely love wolfgang puck rodeo drive k cups it is the best nice rich flavor but not too strong best one yet ! . 
i have purchase this coffee several times my husband said it has a great taste and it is a good cup of coffee . 
i am a huge fan of jamaica me crazy coffee there was a time in my life when i was totally caffeine free and off the dark stuff , but a customer in the bank i worked at brought in a pound of this coffee as a gift to the tellers every time someone walked by my desk with a cup of this freshly made joe , the smell would really tempt me to go back to consuming coffee again eventually it broke me down , and i am back to being a full time coffee drinker , and proud of it ! imagine how happy i was to find my favorite brew in a k cup ! the only thing better than a cup of jamica me crazy is a cup sweetened with the new almond joy flavor international creamer in it to highlight the sweet coconut unfortunately , we only have a keurig at our office \( i'm in real estate now \) , so i have to go to work to enjoy a cup i'm thinking i have a brilliant boss who knows how to get people to willingly show up to work ! now if i can just figure a way to use it to temp more buyers into our office i 'd have it made 0 \) . 
i bought this grudgingly because my favorite timothy 's italian blend was out of stock and i was very happily surprised ! it 's not as big and winey a brew as my favorite , but was flavorful , had a delicious aroma and was smooth i tend to like rather potent coffee but i have clients who prefer a little lighter cup this will be perfect ! i will happily keep buying this coffee thanks wolfgang ! . 
i think this is a love it or hate it kind of coffee i love it the flavor starts out similar to butter toffee , but then sort of morphs into coconut , pineapple , and rum i think it 's delicious and unique , and i do n't ever want to be without some in my cupboard . 
this one will not disappoint ! i got this yesterday and my husband and i tried it this morning with breakfast and we both loved it i have gotten many different kinds of the k cups to try but after trying this one , i think i could be happy with just this one and black tiger for those mornings when i want a really strong cup of coffee the rodeo drive blend is delicious with a nice round feel on the palate and an interesting flavor on the finish with just a hint of smokiness perfectly balanced and absolutely wonderful ! plus , i have to admit i love the label the different color looks very appealing on my carousel with the other k cups . 
we 've tried many of the k cups that are available , and this is in our top 3 we prefer a darker , bolder flavor , and this one hits the mark at the same time it 's quite smooth . 
my husband i both like a mild tasting coffee we thought we would give wolfgang puck breakfast in bed a try we were pleasantly surprised by the full bodied taste but without the bitterness of some of the stronger tasting coffee 's we are very satisfied and will be drinking this for a long time ! now if i can only get my husband to take the name literally ! . 
this k cup is one of my favorites along with coffee people 's jet fuel and black tiger if you like a strong , rich coffee , this will fit the bill . 
not too strong , not too weak smooth without the bitterness great anytime for those not into the strong grow hair on your chest types we will continue to purchase this as a part of our favorite brands . 
wolfgang 's rodeo drive does make a good ole cup of coffee it is on the same line as donut shop very good morning coffee to wake up with . 
i have tried several decaf k cubs and have found this to be the best my husband does not like decaf but has finally found this one he will drink because it has a little bolder taste i find it a good coffee to have in the house for company because everyone seems to like it i will be ordering it again and again ! . 
this coffee is for those who like a strong robust flavor nothing wimpy about it i like just enough cocoa mix and creamer to take off the edge my husband goes for the gusto great wake me up in the morning brew love it ! . 
this is an excellent blend perfect for any time was really surprised by the quality , flavor and finish . 
nice , smooth cup of joe high recommend not sure why there is not more reviews \? ! \? ! . 
this coffee was in a sample selection when we ordered our keurig brewer it was by far our favorite ! i have ordered this coffee several times from amazon it is a dark roast , but not too strong . 
you get a consistent cup of coffee with a hint of hazelnut a cup of hot coffee in about 20 seconds that tastes great what 's not to like about that \? ! \) . 
these have a stronger caramel flavor although still a medium strength coffee the best caramel flavored k cup i 've tried ! i will reorder them . 
i want to try other types of coffee but i am so stuck on this one that it 's hard to try anything else ! this is a mild roast medium or dark roast is too strong for me these days the hazelnut flavor it very nice and every cup brewed is superb i have been drinking this wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut for at least 6 months and it never fails to please give it a try \) . 
love this rodeo drive it has a very drinkable taste is also good and it is smooth ! i recomend that you try this one . 
this is the most delicious coffee ever it does not mess up your stomach it 's amazing and tastes wonderful and everyone at work loves it too . 
for years , i 've been completely devoted to dunkin donuts brewed at the store and at home i tried brewing dd in my k cup and i also bought the eco brew and the actual dd k cups awful ! so i was searching high and low for a new coffee after trying all the decaf k cups on the market , i finally found and loved wolfgang puck decaf coffee k cups this is the only place i can find them so i hope amazon never stops selling them here they are mellow , medium roast and i enjoy them every day any other brand is just a back up try them i have never had any trouble with any of the cups and i'm on my third order now of 48 cups if they had a problem , they 've fixed it br br this is an update being done on july 7 , 2012 i continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee every day it has ruined me for other coffees as i measure every other cup against this incredible wolfgang puck decaf k cup please , please , please amazon , make this part of your subscription service my head hurts trying to make sure that i always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee . 
great product to start your am with as its not too strong but just the right tast for your morning wake us up . 
our keurig coffee maker was a great christmas gift last year one of the pleasures of this device is the experimentation with various coffee blends some have worked well others have not some are too mild some are a bit off on taste br br this wolfgang puck product is one of the more successful experiments with the keurig machine it has a rich taste and still remains smooth not too strong a flavor , but it does have flavor br br so , the two coffee drinkers in my household are quite pleased to drink this brew . 
i roast my own colombian beans at home so i have a perfect 10 for reference right off the bat let me say that just like their sumatran reserve , this k cup is not bitter , but smooth the aftertaste is also smooth my chief complaint is it does not taste like a colombian bean it really is missing the deep flavor of a columbian coffee , while the sumatran puck k cup definitely has a sumatran taste the 8 oclock brand you see in many grocery stores has a more distinct flavor than this k cup that being said , my final recommendation is that i would recoommend the puck sumatran over this if you like a distinct coffee flavor however , if you are looking for a not too stong but not bitter coffee , this colombian is a great choice i would buy this again just because of the smooth taste . 
i 've always been drawn to k cup varieties with out there names \( jet fuel , black tiger \) and distinctive flavors \( golden french toast , spicy mayan chocolate \) this offering melds those two features into something i'm happy to wake up to ! br br to me , jamaica me crazy 's definitely got a pervasive coconut taste fairly similar to dunkin' donuts coconut flavored coffee , but it 's also got a lot of the flavor characteristics i 've come to expect from k cup chocolate brews barely any of that acidic aftertaste that 's almost inevitable with artificial flavors , and definitely not as watery as many other k cup varieties sure , the name 's pretty corny and the taste is hardly subtle or sophisticated , but that 's what makes this cup of joe so fun ! . 
i use this product frequently like most tofu , you need to press it \( between paper towels with a heavy skillet on top works fine \) to get the excess water out the more water you can remove , the less you 'll have to deal with sloppiness when cooking , something the previous reviewer did not like br br as for a blank slate on taste , that 's exactly what makes tofu great it will take on any flavor you want to impart our most common marinade is placing the pressed , cubed tofu in a ziploc with a mix of soy , honey , and lemon or lime juice a quick search online for a marinade will give you ideas \( many also include minced garlic , ginger , etc \) you can also purchase a premade marinade , like a teriyaki sauce the more liquid the marinade \( and the more water removed from pressing \) , the better it will penetrate the tofu even a half hour in the bag works fine br br we saute it right in the pan with the stir fry veggies \( add tofu last it just needs to get warm or , for a firmer style , you can bake or brown it separately first \) and pour in the remaining marinade as the final sauce \( you can thicken with cornstarch if desired \) handle the tofu cubes gently as they are not firm like most meats , but broken up pieces taste just fine too br br marinated tofu cubes also do well on kebabs with veggies on the grill br br plain tofu creams well and is often good in a dish that requires thickness we 've made chocolate mousse with it as well as scrambling it like eggs br br we have great success breading pressed cubes of this tofu just like you would the chicken in a general tso recipe general tso 's tofu is awesome the flavor comes from the sauce so you do n't need to marinate first br br some people also freeze tofu generally remove from packaging and press first to give it a firmer consistency br br tofu is all about how you prepare it most people will not like it plain , so do n't expect to just dig a fork into it br br this particluar product is great because of its all purpose nature \( firm is definitely better than soft for saute , etc \) and its shelf life i would have given it five stars but the must be refrigerated versions packaged in fluid do seem to be firmer they do n't last as long in the house , though , so this is a perfect choice to keep in the pantry \( usually dated a few to several months out \) . 
this is the greatest stuff on the planet first off , i think it 's the best silken tofu there is firm silken will do all of your silken needs , basically i use it to make mousses for desserts in my food processor for instance , add some melted chocolate chips , some corn starch , add to a graham cracker crust you 've got a pie or i will add some peanut butter , cocoa powder and maple syrup to make a mousse i also like to just add strawberries and bananas and maple syrup for a yogurt i use it to make sour cream and onion dips for vegetables i also like it to make sour cream for mexican food and potatoes my omni boyfriend ca n't even tell the difference also good to make mayonnaise for potato salad i recommend a food processor or blender to really get the smooth , creamy texture this tofu is the best stuff on the planet i order the 12 pack of it , because i got through 4 or more a week also , i like to get the organic , because soybeans are typically highly sprayed crops it 's worth the few extra bucks i love this stuff behind my almond milk , this is my most vital ingredient . 
my wife and i decided that we wanted to begin having miso soup for dinner on a more regular basis , so purchased this tofu as an essential ingredient for my miso soup recipe i was totally impressed with the individual packaging of the tofu \( and the fact that it does n't need to be refrigerated \) , the taste and texture , and the overall product quality needless to say , i am reordering and will continue to do so i want to say that my picky kids also love this tofu as well for kids that seem to only want mac cheese , they are gorging themselves on \( much healthier \) miso soup now this makes me happy by the way , i also highly recommend the roland white miso paste \( incredible flavor and great quality \) and the ajinomoto hon dashi soup stock which i both purchased from amazon if interested , my miso soup recipe is as follows 1 package of morinu firm silken tofu \( this stuff \) , 2 tsp dashi soup stock , 3 tbs white miso paste , 4 cups of water and 2 chopped scallions we also reconstitute shitake mushrooms , add dried wakame seaweed \( highly recommend either eden or emerald cove from amazon as well \) , add shaved daikon , etc however , this recipe is awesome just as is we live in northern california with some of the best japanese restaurants in the world , but this recipe blows away \( or at least equals \) what you can get from any restaurant but i digress i highly recommend this tofu ! . 
i used to eat tofu almost every and i hav n't had those for a while br so i was searching and i was actually surprised that amzon has tofu ! br i was half curious and half pleased ! so i bought it and i do n't regret it br it 's organic , cheap and does n't need to be refrigerated until opend br i just like to eat these by it self or with udon soup br i am going to buy this again so good \) . 
having recently turned vegan , i had to buy my mandatory supply of tofu this stuff is the bomb ! i have n't done a lot of exotic things with it thus far , but i love to use it as a salad dressing potato topper i crack open a brick , dump it into the blender , add a little vinegar , a little soy milk , onion power , dill weed , chives , tiny bit of celery seed a generous dose of nutritional yeast i blend all that up till it 's smooth , and then store it in a glad container in the icebox stays fresh for about 4 days i like to just dump this stuff all over my meal of baked potatoes romaine lettuce br br i ca n't wait to explore all the options with this stuff banana pudding may be next ! . 
i am fairly new to tofu but have already gone through 3 cases of this lovely tofu since the beginning of the year br it 's really great very mild flavour that is easily masked by what ever you cook it with br br i make an awesome instant chocolate pudding with this stuff , a box of silken tofu , some dark cocoa powder , stevia and then a bit of milk to loosen it up whiz in a blender or food processor and it makes a super creamy , dreamy delight that i do n't feel guilty about eating and leaves me more satisfied than your standard pudding chill it and it becomes a realllllllllllllly thick , luscious mousse \( making myself hungry \) br br anyhoo , i love that it 's a shelf stable product that i can have on hand for impromptu meals br br sometimes i make burgers by mixing it with smoked paprika , garlic , onion , nutritional yeast , oatmeal , masa flour , bit of nice oil until a thick consistency and fry up and they 're just fantastic br br i think this is one of those foods that 's so versatile and easy to play with and gives you a nice bit of protein to your diet . 
following a plant based diet , i use tofu almost daily it is expensive to purchase at a store and takes up valuable real estate in my fridge these packages sit perfectly on a shelf they are a little smaller than standard refrigerated tofu \( 12 oz vs 16 oz \) they are also silk tofu so they do n't hold their shape as well , which is good for certain things like fried rice or chocolate mousse not great if you are making tofu steaks or strips . 
recently purchased a case of mori nu from amazon i 'd had this tofu before and the product i got from amazon is fine though , a word of caution my case only has about 4 1 2 months to go on its best by date the date on the box represents one year from manufacture , so this product had been sitting around a while not a huge problem but i 'll be looking for silken tofu recipes now \( vegan ice cream ! \) , to use this up , rather than just having silken tofu on hand for a while , as i 'd hoped . 
we recently started eating vegetarian meals , and this product is organic and very solid , you wo n't get a ton of water like you get in store bought tofu , you will be happy with the quality and fast delivery . 
the texture is a little grainy , compared to some other silken tofus \( it tastes a little weird to me , but i got used to it \) i wish this tofu was made only with nigari , instead of gluconolactone and calcium sulfate i'm happy to be able to buy the organic online it was shipped well , arrived with no problems . 
this is much different than the water packed tofu i'm used to but i like it a lot i 've only made pudding with it so far \( chocolate , chocolate peanut butter banana , and next , pumpkin ! \) but i can see the potential uses and reading other reviews and doing various searches for ideas \( mayo ! sauces ! dips ! smoothies ! \) really help too i 'd love to be able to replace mayo with tofu and create a creamy cheesy tofu sauce for mac cheese imagine the calorie savings ! br br the best thing about this tofu is that it 's shelf stable i read on their website \( morinu com \) that each pack is dated on its creation date and is good for one year from that date that 's useful info also check their website for recipes and suggested uses each pack has a recipe on it but it 's the same for all 12 . 
i use this in place of mayo for many recipes when i need something creamy and quick this also works very nice for sweet dishes as there is very little taste to the tofu and it does absorb flavors well like a chocolate pie . 
love these tofu as they do n't require refrigeration until the package is open ! i use tofu a lot in my cooking , so have them handy all the time makes it really convenient ! the price is not too bad for an organic tofu . 
good firm texture , comparing to other silken firm , this is just the right consistency hassle free , it is easy to come out from the container tofu shape as is easy to handle and manage rather than crash or smash it . 
i have used this product for many years it is organic non gmo which is a requirement for me , as well as the good nutrition analysis , ease of use , and cost morinu is packaged with a shelf life of 9 12 months , needs no refrigeration , and can easily adapt to most recipes and smoothies my pantry is never without morinu organic firm tofu and amazon has the best price . 
1000 island dressing strawberry shakes tofu faux omelet ! convenient fast long shelf life delish and organic , i order several 12pks at a time i will also use this product for baking . 
i like this brand and think the shelf stable packaging is great since i ca n't seem to find the organic version locally it 's been delicious in my recipes . 
and we find her here upon this grand amazon ! br br each day morinu feeds me like my own nourishing mother , cherishes and consents my whims with this wonderful food br br eschew all animal byproducts and cadavers br br this tofu is a strengthening food , fit for human consumption br br and so convenient from our mighty amazon , sent right to your front porch or , in my case , post office box with free shipping rather than driving thirty to seventy five miles for the same product at three times the price , plus gas br br this is fit food for humans , food for which our bodies are created , food which feeds us rather than kills both the source and the consumer br br you may read here written by the self deceived that this tofu is too mushy for firmness and that it must be pressed between towels before cooking to them so confused i ask br br cooking \? br br each day at least once a day , i draw forth my serrated knife , and one sacrificial box of this excellent tofu , and i without remorse slice a hole in its top , with great tenderness and care and gratitude , releasing only the slightest and most apologetic gentle spurt of clearest liquid br br and this with a certain yearning br br i do not observe the indications written sternly upon the short edge of the box , but lie this box gently down upon a smooth flat slab of wood , with the face up , and take the knife very gently sliding upon on edge of the top , the very belly of the box , and then upon the other edge of this top , and then most gently along the bottom edge of this top , each time releasing apologetically the slightest hint of a clear liquid , revealing thusly by means of these three slits the gentle hidden secrets of the box , the soft white substance lying shyly within , awaiting with embarrassment our further processing br br i feel the need to explain this procedure with greater care and attention the very tip , the point of the knife , uncovers tenderly a certain point a certain distance from the corner of the broad top of the box , the side with the picture and product label , as pictured here , the side which reads morinu , the broad flat side laid flat the very tip of the knife , i say , discovers probingly a certain point near one corner which offers the proper resistance without too great a resistance , without too little a resistance , to penetrate this membrane too close to the corner is found to be too hard , too resistant , too unwilling , although most convenient for the later proceedings too distant from the corner implies simply random slashings without specific purpose , and our purpose in this procedure is most serious , most purposeful , intent br br in a word therefore the point of the knife penetrates the membrane slowly yet purposefully as close to the corner as possible , penetrating as deeply as possible without piercing the wooden slab beneath a certain spurt of clear liquid may emerge , but let this prove no inhibition , as the knife reaches the depth of the box slowly withdraw the knife , slowly , at a diagonal , allowing the serration softly with friction to continue to separate a slight slit along the ege of the box , slowly , resolutely but patiently , with purpose , as the serration creates an ever longer slit along that edge , as closely as possible br br continue from this first slit along the the contiguous edge of the top of this box , and then the third edge , inserting carefully your knife , and slowly withdrawing with a friction sufficient to separate the membrane without shredding , without eliciting over muchly the clear liquid which may spurt forth br br let us call the top right corner of the box point a , the bottom right corner point b , the left bottom corner point c and the upper left corner point d begin to pierce at point a , proceed in turn to b , to c , ending at d , forming this a slit along the three edges arriving at point d , withdraw the knife completely , wipe the blade with a soft , dry cloth and set it aside for cleansing we now may lift the flap thus created , exposing the delicate white contents within br br i feel remiss if i do not address a probable misconception here writtenonly for the rhetorical convenience , and i feel compelled by the necesity of correcting this counter indication , no matter how unclear this may be , due only to my severely limiting literary incapacities br br employing the same alphabetical coordinates as described above , the consumer may discover this procedure far more efficacious to begin at point a and proceed gently yet firmly to point b as described divergently , however , please proceed to point d \( !

even with the chocolate chunks , these bars taste far less sweeter than most granola bars out there and i really appreciated that br br they have 110 calories each and 8 grams sugar which is less than kudos chocolate chip \( 120 cal , 12 sugar \) or a cascadian farms chocolate chip granola bar \( 140 cal , 10 sugar \) when i need a quick snack , i can eat one with a glass of sparkling water and i feel full until the next meal if i need a quick meal i eat one of these with two string cheeses , a large apple and water i can make it until dinner br br i would recommend these to anyone looking for a tasty and quick snack . 
these tiny candies are as delicious as they are presentable every single kind of them tastes great ! they are packaged well when i am through the bag , i am ordering it again ! ! . 
this tea is strong and has a smoky flavor you can feel the leafy greenness though it 's not very bitter i think it 's a bit expensive for it is but i have n't found a replacement i guess we 're paying for the fancy packaging , which in my opinion is a real waste , especially when you go through 3 4 cups a day like i do ahmed 's gunpowder green tea is stronger and is pretty good , but is available for cheaper than dilmah 's in the local indian stores . 
if you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea , stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea you can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the stevia powder br br unlike artificial sweeteners , stevia is never bitter and wo n't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth the packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods br br by using a low calorie \( 0 calories \) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs , you will be ahead of the game every single time you use one packet of stevia , you are using less sugar and you wo n't even miss it br br the rebecca review . 
a nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners stevia is made from herb in south america japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said it 's quite a bit sweeter than sugar , so you need less of it as a replacement br br i like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 t cocoa it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the stevia is calorie free ! the stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great , refreshing treat for the day br br this multi pack offer for this price is about 30 lower than what i can get nustevia for locally . 
take the warm scent of italian bergamot and blend it with natural raspberry flavor and swirl it into south indian black tea and what you are creating is a raspberry dream of a tea this tea , if made with powdered milk , honey or a packet of stevia becomes creamy br br top with vanilla whipped cream and you have a vanilla raspberry bergamot tea this is the perfect for tea parties or sipping in the morning while enjoying a raspberry muffin br br the people who pick the tea leaves are paid a fair wage and the positive energy really does come through in the flavor of the tea the tea leaves are also organic br br i think this is the most delicious tea i 've ever tasted ! once you try this flavor , you will want to try all the flavors i also love the fireside chai br br the rebecca review . 
i love passion fruit juice and this is a very good product each bottle makes about a gallon it is low in sugar and low on glycemic index has a lot of potassium and is a natural relaxer makes great cocktails too if it is n't relaxing enough for you straight up ! fast delivery and great product ! . 
o k , so it 's not officially kosher but this is how you make gelatin without cow 's hooves , for those of you who get grossed out by jell o if you think about it too much br br now foods is a company that sells gluten free stuff , and this is no exception if you have celiac this wo n't make you sick br br even better , this is powdered agar agar , not flaked agar agar that means this will last for months , if not years although it 's also easy to use too much 1 tablespoon of the flakes 1 2 tsp of the powder the ratio most cooks call for is 1 cup liquid to 1 teaspoon flaked agar agar , which means 1 4 tsp of this powder to 1 cup liquid , with more added for more acidic things like orange juice br br however , agar agar does n't gel as well as jell o , so do n't expect to get the same results that you would for jell o for that , you need jell o or kosher gelatin \( you can add more agar agar to add firmness but then it starts to taste like what it is seaweed \) . 
awesome ! this powder was bought as a media replacement for my ant works ant farm i have n't tried it as a food supplement , but mixed with a little food dye , pedialite sugar it worked perfectly as ant gel br br it makes a firm gel clear that holds at room temperature . 
i agree with the reviewer who said it wo n't give you 100 the firmness of jello but it does satisfy my cravings ! wonderful product ! . 
i received the agar about 12 days after ordering it comes in a slightly different bottle now , but i assume its the same agar agar as before the bottle has a snap lid \( i'm not so sure about the quality of the seal so i keep the agar agar in an airtight container just as a precaution \) i dont plan on eating any of this , but i have used this successfully with mycology experiments in petri dishes \( the agar is light enough to see everything well in the dish \) so it works great for that . 
agar is basically gelatin for vegans , \( or vegetarians \) regular gelatin is usually animal based , and is made from leftover body parts of animals that would otherwise be thrown away sound appetizing \? agar is a cruelty free alternative , and is a great aid anytime a thickened creamy base is required , usually in baking i use this for many cream pies as well as other desserts . 
i bought the 2 lb bottle for use in microbio experiments i have n't really eaten any of it yet , so i ca n't comment on the taste or anything like that br but for growing things , it 's great br since it 's a powder it 's easy to measure out use , unlike those annoying flaky bars br after the agar sets , it 's quite clear which is nice . 
not really much to say about the product other than it arrived similar to as pictured and works as described i used it as a natural stabilizer for doughnut icing which was excellent american wholesale got it to me in 4 days i purchased 2 oz usa product . 
i needed this for a no bake cheese cake and i do n't use gelatin , kind of creeps me out but it worked well for what i needed , be sure to read directions . 
i have n't tried eating it i bought it to make vegan diy pore strips it totally works ! hooray ! i did n't have much luck when microwaving it , but if you boil it like it says on the bottle it firms up quite nicely bear in mind , you must add soy milk to make the pore strips the agar simply does n't have the ability on it 's own . 
product was great , but i ordered paid for 2 lbs received only 2 oz i have been unable to get any response from custom service there is no way to reach the company by phone i just put this credit card transaction into disputed ! \( \( \( i still want my 2 lbs ! . 
we have been looking for a good chocolate sandwich cookie since hydrox are no longer being made or sold , and famous amos fits the bill much better than oreos or other types , it is sweet , the chocolate is distinct and the filling is not too sweet as if it is made of only sugar the amazon price is the best , subscribe and save is new and brings the price down to an irresistible buy , which is even more special since these cookies are not always at the grocery . 
progresso 's chicken gumbo soup does n't taste all that great when it comes out of the microwave \( or off the stove , if that 's your way \) , but it tastes pretty good it has white meat chicken , kidney beans , okra , rice , celery , carrot , tomato , and red bell pepper in it , as you can see from the picture on the can check the picture i uploaded to see what the soup actually looks like in the bowl the chicken was pretty firm and just right , in my bowl the gumbo taste is n't bad you wo n't feel like you 're in louisiana or memphis while you 're eating it \( unless you 're actually in louisiana or memphis \) , but it has the distinctive gumbo taste and is really quite good compared to some of progresso 's other soups my biggest complaint with this soup is that the green vegetables came out mushy , as they tend to with progresso soups , i 've found the celery and okra were good , just very soft and mushy , which is n't really what i wanted it did a pretty good job of filling me up , though , as they pack a whole lot into that can as always overall a good soup that i would n't mind buying more of if i see it on the shelves sometime . 
this is my favorite progresso soup the broth has excellent flavor and it 's not too salty yes the veggies could be a bit firmer , but the pieces are large and tasty it has some heat already , but i usually add a few shots of hot sauce to suit my taste if i really want to indulge , i 'll chop up a few pieces of smoked sausage and add it before heating heaven ! . 
i am doing the subscribe and save thing with these crackers i thought that it would take a while to get through the six boxes , but boy was i wrong already we 're halfway through the boxes time to order more ! . 
the crackers are very tasty and we just tried them out with a little salsa on top for a healthy low cal snack and my wife and i absolutely love'em we will definitely get more once we run out ! . 
i love this tea i hated my friends asking me if i was pregnant i decided to diet but was n't easy i was always hungry and at bedtime i could n't help it and ended up with a plate of ice cream no good i decided to give this tea a try and i stopped feeling hungry all the time the taste is great i have lost ten pounds in almost two months i walked al least an hour per day , i only have fruits and tea in the mornings , salad and protein for lunch and fresh smoothies without sugar for dinner if i feel hungy i have a fruit or raw vegetable i put chopped garlic on my salads , it gets rid of waste too i dont diet on weekends but my stomach is smaller so i get full with less and less food i am buying this for my sister it has been awesome for me thanks ! . 
i loved this green tea with acai and grape added to it it made me feel awesome and gave me lots of energy ! i would recommend this tea to tea lovers who like a bit of an extra boost i think the acai extracts help a lot and made me feel wonderful . 
ca n't complain taste good and had quick delivery ! it was my first time trying this tea out i usually drink the peppermint one but this gave me energy and sustained me throughout the day . 
i would recommend this tea , it has a fresh taste with an amazing acai grape flavor that i have not had before it also gave me energy which i can always use ! . 
tom douglas , a famous seattle chef , has created a spicy steak rub that is especially delicious i rub this seasoning on the best filet mignon i can find then i cook the steaks in a little oil one thing about this seasoning is it is made with brown sugar this means your steak is going to burn a bit unless you keep the heat on medium or lower when i use this steak rub i tend to cook the steaks a little on each side and then i cut them up into smaller pieces and continue frying this guarantees that they wo n't burn to be honest i ca n't really taste the rosemary in this mix , the peppers are much more prominent my husband loves to eat the steaks with a little tiger sauce he thinks that makes them just perfect i have also tried the salmon rub and the chicken rub and have found them all to be delicious br br the rebecca review . 
my husband and i found this rub in a little market in philly a few years ago we have since purchased it religiously since it adds great flavor to steaks that now ca n't eat a steak without it it is definitely a must try ! . 
this steak rub is spectacular i rub it liberally on steak \( usually ny strip \) , let is sit for a while and then grill it has been getting rave reviews and we are already on our 3rd jar i wish they would sell it in bigger jars amazon 's price is a bit high though . 
this product is ok , i think it has too much sugar and the flavor is not that strong br i enjoyed it , but did not meet my expectations . 
i was skeptical because i 've seen mixed reviews on similar products like this but i'm glad i jumped in and decided to purchase it first of all the shipping was fast and it comes gift wrapped free which is cool second , the glass works great which is most important its double walled so when i poured my boiling hot water in the glass i had no problem carrying it from the kitchen to my bedroom and barely feeling any warmth the filter strainer does exactly what its supposed to do which is keep the loose tea out of your mouth while you drink your tea this is the first time i 've used something like this and it works perfectly for me br br the blooming tea comes in three small containers i'm new to tea so i ca n't tell what kind it is most likely some type of jasmine green tea because it smells good the first steeping is very mild but the second one the flavor really comes out anyway i hope this helps people that are on the fence like i was about buying glasses like this this package is legit and well worth the price . 
fabulous gift the blooming teas were lovely and unique packaging was beautiful and perfect for a gift . 
i bought this for my son who travels often he 's told me the thermos worked well the blooming teas were good for 6 brews ! . 
i am so happy to have bought this tumbler it is very handy to have around and works beautifully i whole heartedly recommend this product to anyone looking for a convenient tea making device i love the blooming bulbs and how you can see them while it brews ! \) . 
just be aware that it 's quite expensive for the amount that you 're getting \( less than a pound of pasta per package \) . 
i like to use walnut oil in salad dressings and in baking it 's delicious when added to pancakes and muffin mixes in lieu of regular vegetable oil it adds just a hint of flavor without being overwhelming and with the price that amazon offers it for vs what my local grocery store charges for a smaller amount , it is a definite bargain would highly recommend ! . 
this walnut oil is the best on the market it has been roasted which enhances the walnut flavor i love it with scrambled eggs and in preparing rice dishes i 've even used it to condition my hair ! i completely trust roland foods because they are superior in every way . 
i purchased this to use on unfinished butcher block , which worked fine , but when i opened the first can the delightful aroma from this oil had me making a walnut apple viinegret that was delicious . 
this is oil is quite a good value compared to the grocery store prices we always keep a can in the refrigerator . 
i used this oil for a few years now for almost every recipe it bakes really good in breads and it smells nice , and good in salads highly recommended . 
this is an aromatic and tasty oil , great on salads or for scrambled eggs br i'm sure i 'll find more uses for this as time goes on ! free shipping br makes it a great deal my only nit pick is the lid two of the three br bottles in the shipment had very tight lids that were difficult to open . 
if you 're looking for a great grain free alternative to beef or chicken , this is it my two girls loved it we used to put some in their kongs , then put in dry food and then seal the end with more wet food and put it in the freezer so that dinner would become more of a challenge the only con with this food is that it can be pricey , as are most wellness products you could probably get the same results you 're looking for from a grain free food with something like taste of the wild , which is what we 've gone to because of cost . 
medaglia d'oro instant espresso coffee is by far the best way to make a latte in the comfort of your home and it 's also the cheapest ! i use it to make an awesome vanilla latte just put two \( 2 \) spoonfuls of the medaglia d'oro espresso in a coffee cup and add about 2 shots of hot water and mix place a shot of vanilla syrup in a tall glass \( more or less according to individual taste \) next add enough cubed not crushed ice to fill the glass 2 3rds of the way up then fill the glass with enough cold milk to cover the ice pout the hot coffee mix over the milk and ice and stir vigorously until mixed add more ice as needed and then pour enough half and half to color the coffee mix to a yummy caramel color delicious and cheaper than the espresso stands \( once you have the ingredients on hand \) medaglio is also great in recipes that call for instant espresso not all stores carry this product so i order from gristedes through amazon com . 
i have n't bought this online yet \( i just saw it here for the first time today \) , but i 've been buying it locally for almost a year now i originally bought it for a mocha dessert recipe in the south beach diet book i tried it to make a latte and was pleasantly surprised i had n't expected much from instant espresso based on past experience with instant coffees this is actually very good i have only used it for lattes and mochas i do n't do espresso by the shot i particularly like it when i go camping i 've shared it with fellow campers who also liked it the flavor is rich and can be adjusted to taste by varying the amount per cup it also has a light froth on top i recommend it highly . 
i love coffee , but i also love not having to messing with the coffee maker sometimes this instant espresso is the best i have tried and i have tried about 7 different brands br br not overly acidic at all , melts instantly in hot water \( no sand dunes left swirling at the top if your cup \) , travels wonderfully \( compact jar \) and is very versitile to have around for cooking br br i but a tsp in a batch of brownies to deepen the dark chocolate flavor br br i put a tbs in a big batch of chili to compliment the spices and add extra richness br br i add a bit to mexican mole sauce for punch br br i also put it in chocolate granache icing , chai tea with milk for a java chai latte , coffee drink mixes for extra umph , etc br br it is over 5 bucks at some supermarkets , when if you can even find it , so it is nice to know it is cheaper at amazon ! . 
i received a jar of this instant espresso as a gift from my mother in law i was quite insulted at first , as i 've never used instant coffee of any kind and could n't figure out why she gave it to me ! then this past weekend , i was out of coffee beans this was all i had \( must have coffee in morning \) so i made it , wow , it was awesome ! ! in fact , i'm drinking a mug of it right now as i right this review ! i love it ! ! however , i make it in more of a latte fashion i 've also added hot chocolate to it for a mocha latte i 'll definitely be looking for it at my neighborhood stores , and if i ca n't find it , i 'll be getting it here on amazon definitely a great buy ! ! . 
this instant coffee is a versatile ingredient you can add it to ice cream you are freezing \( or gelato or sorbet \) or you can add it to chocolate icing to make mocha flavor it is the ingredient to have when the recipe calls for one cup of strong , cold coffee br br as a beverage on its own , it is a bit more acid than fresh espresso but as a mix with milk , it works wonderfully well you wo n't make a barrista cup of espresso with instant , but you will have a great way to make a latte in a pinch and for regular cooking , i personally am never without this jar on my shelf . 
i prefer this to all other brands and types of coffee even after having lived in italy , this is my favorite . 
i was introduced to this product a few years ago and was floored by how tasty and depending on the amount and type of milk added \( 2 or whole \) , how chocolaty the flavor could even be i 've recently moved and do n't know where to find it locally so i'm trying the online purchasing option i'm almost out of it ! br br this is a very nice option for those of us who do n't drink coffee all that often but want to have something of quality in the kitchen cupboard goes great with trader joes hot chocolate powder too . 
i use this for work it 's very quick and easy and much better than the vile coffee they provide br br i do n't understand the price though a 2 oz jar at whole foods was 4 49 well before the exp date . 
this is a great product when in a hurry ! i'm surprised at the price though my store sells it for 3 49 bottle when i'm traveling i can usually find this at mexican markets even cheaper i love amazon usually their products are less expensive than buying at stores . 
i have never been a fan of instant coffee , so the only reason i purchased this was to use in a homemade kahlua recipe the kahlua turned out great so i decided to get another jar to have on hand as a tea drinker who has lived for years without a coffee maker , it is so nice to have an instant option that tastes great and has a good kick br br delicious ! . 
i am very fond of this coffee , and i wo n't accept substitutes for it several of my local stores have substituted another brand i just order it on line when i cannot get it in a store however , amazon 's price is too high it 's 4 a jar in local stores . 
i have been using this instant expresso coffee for about a year now i buy it in our local supermarket for 3 49 a 2 oz jar i originally needed it for a brownie recipe and looked here to purchase , but i saw the 9 99 price and that certainly made me take a ride to the store luckily , it was on the shelf and at a very reasonable price only one store in the area stocks it br br check your local stores before you buy this online chances are you will find it at a very lesser price locally i use it now not just in brownies , but i add two teaspoons to a protein shake , and it makes a great coffee shake br br thank you . 
is this 21 99 price for a single 2 ounce jar or for a 6 pack \? the description only indicates that the price is for 2 ounces , which , of course , is ridiculously expensive but it 's a good deal if it 's for a 6 pack previous buyers , can you please advise \? the coffee itself is excellent i usually buy it in the store and was hoping to find a deal on amazon . 
medglia d'oro instant espresso works great in recipes i'm not crazy about the stand alone taste , but did n't buy it for that purpose anyway as some have suggested i might have found it at a lower price in a store , but looked everywhere and could n't find instant espresso in any brand , so this order was easy and reasonable . 
i bought this from safeway for about 5 it 's awesome in making those homemade iced caramel macchiatos that cost 4 at starbucks ! \) br br \( i do n't know if it 's just me , but it has this slight chocolatey aftertaste to it that 's just absolutely divine \) . 
i love the strong coffee flavor of this for baking , and have been using it for nearly 20 years in my chocolate chip cookies and other recipes br br it 's also tasty to drink , for a portable mix , i 'll use instant dry milk , this coffee , a bit of unsweetened cocoa and a bit of sweetener then just add boiling water and stir well to make a drinkable instant latte it 's not bitter or burnt tasting like some instant coffees can be br br while it does n't taste as good as a pulled shot of espresso , it 's one of the best instant coffees i 've ever tried it 's ability to mix well into baked goods ensure it 's spot in my pantry . 
i used to work at that well known coffee shop so i 've become a bit of a coffee snob and i never drink instant , but if you are looking for a really robust instant coffee that dissolves in cold or hot water and goes great with a little chocolate syrup and cream you 'll enjoy medaglia d'oro , i bought it during a run to the store for a few dollars cheaper than i can find it online , and much cheaper than a 3 4 lb bag they sell in the groceries stores . 
i bought this because none of the instant coffee was strong enough for me and was tired of waiting in line at starbucks i tried it and could n't believe it ! i am so hooked on this product and hope that my local grocery store continues to stock it . 
there 's nothing like a cup of black \( espresso \) coffee to end a meal i do n't know why it 's not on the super market shelves anymore my favorite way of using it , however , is cold with plenty of ice on a hot summer 's day . 
this is a great product , but 21 for 2oz really \? you can get it from other sellers or at the grocery store for 6 7 show this price gouger what the market will really bear ! . 
i wanted to have an instant coffee for work i do n't like the standard company coffee at work i came across medaglia d'oro in a heb store in houston it just looks more interesting than coffee i was actually hoping it would n't be as strong as espresso but not as watered down as instant coffee i am glad i bought it it has the same consistency at espresso but not as strong in taste i am probably using more water that what is suggested on the directions i work 3rd shift , so i think it is fitting the bill of keeping me awake ! true espresso drinkers may think it is kind of weak but it would do in a pinch i will use this for flavoring drinks desserts also . 
it was what i was looking for i had a hard time finding expresso instant coffee a little expensive but oh well . 
i was camping up on the mendicino coast and ran out of coffee i stopped at a market in gualala cute sea coast town and bought a jar of this coffee seemed expensive to me until , i tasted it wow ! its totally amazing ! this is instant \? \? why use my coffee maker any more \? hard to find , though i 'll buy it on amazon absolutely a gourmet treat . 
i really love espresso i cannot find it in the stores where i live so i have send for it br thank you , br mary e nevling . 
i love this item for cooking it is especially good in brownies , cakes and just a little bit in hot cocoa is wonderful . 
this is strong coffee like the italian espresso a teaspoon in a cup is sufficient take care you do n't boil the water , otherwise it will loses its flavor the water should be between warm and hot i use it black with a small lump of brown sugar a real amateur will tell you that the use of any sugar is sacrilege but what can i do \? the flesh is weak . 
i am a coffee snob , and this is absolutely a greatest easy way to have excellent coffee got really tired of grinding beans everyday , now i discovered this ! ! and i am italian , so i should know ! ! . 
i spotted the brand while watching everyday italian on the food channel i drink it alone , as well as , adding it to brownies to make expresso brownies wonderful ! . 
love this coffee , good flavor the large quantity lasts longer then the smaller boxes so i do n't have to order as frequently it did ship quickly too \) i would order again ! . 
these arrived very quickly i was excited to see how the pups would like them i like that there are so many in the package i 've always held in high regard anything rawhide sweet potato so this was a no brainer our pups love both ! these sticks are the best ! they incorporate chewing , gnawing , flavor fun i definitely would buy these again . 
gravy could be a little thicker but the taste is great the price is n't bad either makes great sailsbury steaks and stroganof . 
great stuff ! wonderful beef taste , very smooth could be a little thicker so more of it would stay on top of the potatoes , but very good , and worlds better than other packaged gravies . 
this sauce has one of the best flavors i 've ever tasted there 's a good balance between spice and garlic it has decent heat and tastes good on a lot of things i'm not a big fan of most habanero sauces due to the extra bitterness of the pepper but this sauce blends everything perfectly . 
roses lime juice has that lime flavor that the knock offs do not have roses has just the right amount of sugar so that it 's not too sweet great for making any kind of gimlet vodka , gin or even tequila \( my favorite \) since liquor is expensive do n't settle for less than the original ! . 
this is the best of the ready made kinds in my experience , the powdered kinds are truly awful the other ready made brands taste like pure yellow mustard this one is made with horseradish and no real wasabi , but it works well with sushi br br it also makes a great cocktail sauce for shrimp when mixed with plain old ketchup and a pinch of old bay seafood seasoning . 
this is the only way to eat sashimi the customer service is just outstanding ! ! ! thank you so much ! will do business with them soon . 
i am on a gluten free diet but even before i learned i was sensitive , i loved some of the wow cookies my two favorites are the ginger and the oatmeal which i would rate 5 star because both are fantastic ! who does n't love chocolate chip cookies right \? i know i always have but the texture and flavor of the wow chocolate chip cookies is just ok in my opinion and my daughter and husband both agree although they are my granddaughter 's favorite and i'm pretty sure if she was over 13 \( she 's 6 \) she would do her own review and it would be 5 star ! . 
these are the best gluten free cookies around the snicker doodles are also great ! they are great to serve at parties or have for a snack i wish they were a little cheaper , but they are worth it ! . 
this cookies are so good there very close to my grandmothers home baked cookies but gluten free this cookies are soft which i like in chocolate chip cookies but might be a little chew for some people i think there great very happy . 
cats are finicky animals and what one loves another wo n't touch that is not a reflection on the food itself i have two burmese and their eating habits are very different my local pet nutrition center kindly gave me a sample of prowl the other day and while my one cat absolutely loves it , the other wo n't touch it that 's why samples are nice both of my cats have been on evo kibble , but this one cat who now loves the prowl , has a habit of throwing up and i'm on the prowl myself for an alternative food that will help her keep food down so far , no barf she also laps it up as soon as i 've added warm water no waiting i highly recommend you obtain a sample and let the cat decide , as the food is economical as well as healthy . 
i feed prowl because it is a high quality healthy food that does not break my budget it is much cheaper than other premium wet foods \( wellness , weruva , etc \) , and my cat seems to like it the only downside to prowl is that , since it is dehydrated , you must mix it with water and wait 10 minutes before serving my kitten meows at me the entire time br i started my cat on prowl because my vet offered a free sample she ate it right away with no problems however , she 'd only ever had healthy food , so i was not transitioning from an unhealthy grain filled \( but addictively tasty \) food br it is very easy to digest and may be a solution for cats with digestion problems i recommend \( like another reviewer \) that you order a free sample and give it a try . 
my dogs absolutely love this i have been looking for a natural healthy food to store in my camper in case of emergency last year with all the wildfires i decided to load my camper as a quick bug out vehicle for me and my three dogs i have been vacum sealing thier dry blue buffalo kibble but it takes up a lot of room i read a review about this dehydrated dog food from a person takes thier dog camping all time and this was the perfect solution for them and decided to give it a try my dogs let me know its supper time when i get home now because they are all about this food . 
my dogs both loved this ! it 's easy to fix , and very healthy i was already sold on the frozen raw diet for my dogs before trying this one of my dogs has several food allergies this was a healthy alternative suggested to me that i am very pleased with ! i tried using hot water to speed up the process for my hungry dogs , and it worked extremely well ! definitely recommend this product ! . 
she 's not a particularly food driven dog , so i 've tried lots of organic natural foods one that she consistently loves is any kind of addiction 's raw dehydrated food she can barely contain herself while it rehydrates a bit so much so , that i 've started using hot water to speed the process along otherwise , it 's just such drama while she waits for it this dehydrated option takes up so little room compared to dealing with clunky cans , and as long as she 's happy , i'm happy i try a different flavor everytime i order just to keep her interested so far , so good ! . 
i 've always wanted to go to a raw diet for my cairn but in its frozen form it took up too much room in our rv fridge freezer as we travel camp a lot ! a friend recently told me about addiction and this is the answer for us takes up little space in our cupboard and provides a healthy diet , along with a mixture of wysong epigen kibble , and fresh fruits and vegetables that our cairn loves he 's a very happy camper ! the cats at home love it , too ! we 've only tried brushtail but get the venison treats for variety i'm sure we 'll try the others , too , for a change up from time to time \( done in moderation and over a period of time so as not to upset the tummies ! \) ! ! ! ! . 
note that i'm not recommending you feed your cat dog food on any kind of regular basis the two types of animals generally need different kinds of foods and nutrients however , at the time i was having trouble finding cat specific dehydrated food that i thought my cats would tolerate , and this was the one dehydrated food i found that included a high amount of protein and specifically mentioned taurine on the label , which cats need , so i decided to use it temporarily the cats absolutely adore it i 've since found a cat specific flavor from the same company , but i 'll probably use a little of this now and then as variety br br the cats' coats look and feel shiny and healthy , and they definitely vomit less than when fed more mainstream foods i also mixed it with some straight ground raw meat organs bone to make sure they were getting plenty of meat the wild brushtail certainly seems to agree with them as a protein source , and there are precious few protein sources that do n't make them sick \( i'm limited to chicken , turkey , rabbit , and a small amount of fish usually \) because the brushtail is wild it is n't grain fed , and thus should have plenty of the right nutrients also , according to the company , it 's an overpopulated nuisance pest , so this is a responsible way to help conserve the forests brushtail devour and the animals that live there what 's not to love \? . 
i started out by purchasing the 4 oz trial package of summer brushtail and my little girl absolutely loved it ! ! now i am getting the larger package so we do n't run out my chinese crested suffers allergies to poultry and grains and was pretty much limited to a red meat diet since she is a hairless variety she was on a red meat formula coated in herring oil for her skin the herring left her with fish breath all the time this is a great alternative to the fish because the richness in omega 3 and 6 fatty acids and no more fish breath ! ! since she has been on this her skin quality is much better this is also great to mix with kibble if you have a picky little eater like i do , just mix a tbsp up in the kibble and you end up with a happy plate every time . 
this is really the best decaf i have tried it is hard to find any better than the italian decafs like this one or illy unless of course you are the average local coffee drinker used to embarassments like folgers or accustomized to all the overburned and stinking like charcoal brands named for an unknown reason french roast , italian roast etc \( believe me , they have nothing to do with french or italian coffee \) not to mention the local decafs which taste more like tea made out of burned wood shavings . 
i normally drink lavazza rossa expresso \( made in a french press \) , but in attempt to cut down on my caffeine intake i have weaned my self to decaf while other decaf coffee has given me heartburn or just tasted awful , this lavazza hit the spot while it is not quite as rich as the rossa , it is still has plenty of rich chocolatey flavor , is beautifully smooth and not at all bitter the only downside i have is the price tag and the need to buy it buy the can \( rather than the vacuum packet \) its a full 3 more than i pay for the same amount of rossa it is by far the best decaf that i have ever drunk . 
i 've looked everywhere for a decaf espresso for my delonghi ec355 tried coffee from the grocery store but the decaf was never espresso grind , ordered newman 's decaf espresso grind on line and it was n't that great not good flavor for espresso , and just ok for cappuccino i tried this on a whim because of the price and the super saver shipping here on amazon and i was floored with my frist cup ! it 's rich , it has flavor , the crema is excellent ! i have signed up for the auto shipment of this and could n't be happier i can finally have excellent italian coffee and i do n't even have to leave home or go to italy to find it . 
finally a great decaf it has a really wonderful and complete flavor not like a lot of the decafs on the market that are just missing the kick i use a jura capresso super automatic to make my espresso it works lovely in the bypass funnel on this machine \( since it is pre ground \) the flavor stands up nice to milk for capuccinos and lattes this is my every day decaf espresso i have n't found anything better and i 've tried a lot the illy decaf is comperable in flavor quality but at about double the price the illy just is n't worth it . 
lavazza decaf espresso was the best tasting of the 6 leading brands i tried in my gaggia classic machine , and this 4 pack was the least expensive per can that i found on the internet the grind is not quite fine enough but 3 sec in a cheap non burr grinder produced the correct degree of fineness for a mouse 's tail and perfect crema . 
we love this coffee alone or mixed with caffeinated coffee our preference is for dark strong coffee , and this is both . 
this is excellent espresso and works great in my delonghi ec155 in a side by side taste test , i can barely discern any difference between this and the lavazza inblu variety both have lovely crema , aroma and flavor i have been drinking a lot of espresso lately and this excellent decaf allows me to do so without being jittery or losing sleep br br if you are new to making espresso , save yourself some stress and start with this one of the keys to gaining proficiency is reducing the variables yes , grinding beans yourself will get you slightly fresher espresso , but when there are problems what do you need to fix \? the grind \? the roast \? your tamping \? the espresso maker \? once you are proficient with this excellent expertly ground espresso , you will be in a much better position to experiment with grinding your own . 
this is great coffee , you cannot tell that it is decaf the flavor is just perfect , well balanced , not burned like starbucks and makes good crema works nicely with my jura espresso cappuccino machine i bought two four packs already and going through my 6th jar at the moment . 
i 've been using this coffee for several years and i am quite satisfied for a decaf , it is rich and satisfying , a robust taste for the early morning one of the best decaf coffees i 've tasted . 
when it comes to flavors in a good cup of espresso coffee , it is all in the way how the beans are roasted the robust flavor of this coffee should make the most desiring espresso lovers proud and it has a little secret , which most of us italians would n't admit in public , it is decaffeinated wow , a double whammy i 've been using this coffee for several years now and no other decaf pre ground coffee comes close . 
this is simply the best decaf for making espresso money can buy at a fraction of the cost , this coffee beats everything else out there , including illy try also the regular variety and crema e gusto they are all well worth the money note this coffee should be used only for making espresso of course , you have to know what you are doing as well . 
i thought i did n't care for decaf espresso since it always had a bitter flavor that ranged from a moderate undertone to an overwhelming bite i enjoy strong flavored coffee , but bitter coffee is another story br br well , it turns out that i was just drinking the wrong stuff lavazza decaf is absolutely delightful strong , full bodied , but no bitterness nice crema , smooth and rich really hits the spot ! br br it does , however , have a bit more caffeine than other decafs not much , but i can feel it a bit \( i'm very sensitive to caffeine if you 're not , you probably wo n't notice it \) not enough that it causes a problem but even if it did , i 'd probably still drink this it 's that good ! br br highly recommend . 
i would prefer to drink the regular lavazza all the time , but when i cannot handle the caffeine i use this it is a very good coffee . 
my hubby i love lavazza , our absolute fave ! this decaf espresso is just as good as the regular i can now have it every day , again , without worrying about my bp going up amazon , you are awesome ! from the time i placed my order , it only took 4 days for me to receive it subscribe save is a great service , too i will remain a loyal customer for life ! . 
i know nothing about this co2 method of decaffeinating but thought i would give this a try i usually buy the swiss water processed this had a wonderful chocolatey taste it also claimed to be 99 9 caffein free hopefully this is all true because it really is the best i have tried of decaf . 
excellent quality product which reminds me of italy without the caffeine perfect for after dinner without the effects of too much caffeine . 
i 've always enjoyed the decaf at a little italian restaurant in our downtown area i noticed that their affiliated deli sold lavazza and i asked if that is what they brewed for the restaurant and was told yes i immediately went to amazon and ordered and i am not sorry what a great price for an excellent cup of coffee ! now i get the restaurant flavor without spending the restaurant price ! . 
very smooth and rewarding to have a decaff that does not bite the taste buds simply an enjoyable coffee dz . 
this espresso is delicious it 's strong , but not too strong , and full bodied and it 's terrific for making cappuccino this brand is probably my favorite . 
i have tried many of the lavazza blends as i must have my morning cappuccino and ca n't be without a good espresso blend my hubby only drinks decaf and we have found this blend to be just as good as the regular blend lavazza many times i blend it 1 2 and 1 2 for a late day pick me up would n't be without it . 
i am not an espresso snob i may roast my own beans for drip coffee , but when i'm making espresso it 's generally going in a bunch of milk and syrups br br i purchased the lavazza because i was out of the alessi decaf i 'd purchased at the store and the lavazza was a good deal for my purposes , this is completely adequate and does a fine job at the same time i placed this order , i also ordered some lavazza non decaf espresso , which frankly does n't seem to be as good as the illy i 've been using for half the price , though , i can probably suffer through the decreased quality br br if you 're drinking it straight , probably not a good choice if you 're mixing it , it 's more than adequate . 
i recently visited paris and when i came back to the states i could n't drink the coffee so i found a french website that had some great brands but it cost and arm and a leg to send them here lavazza was one of the italian coffees on the french website and i found it here on amazon ! ! so now i can have excellent espresso for a decent price ! ! ! thank you amazon ! ! ! . 
i just used this to make myself an espresso and it was one of the best tastes of coffee that i 've ever had i was absolutely surprised but it was sooo good i ca n't wait until the morning so i can have another cup \( or two \) yum ! . 
i buy lavazza regular espresso in the black can pretty regularly , as i consider it the smoothest tasting of all in the supermarket br this decaf in the green can is just as good , but lacks the kick of caffeine br br one reviewer loves bustelo well it 's a matter of taste i found bustelo to be harsh and unpleasant br c'est la vie . 
this is the coffee that our friends , who are originally from italy , use every day they highly recommend it they also use lavazza crema e aroma coffee beans , 2 2 pound bag i have had both of these at their house and both kinds are excellent we get it using the subscription option which gives you a great discount and free shipping . 
i looked all over town and could't find any decaf expresso fortunately , amazon provided me with the lavazza alternative , and it was a tasty and welcome experience the can is pop top , so no cut fingers the product is tasty it 's a win win situation i highly recommend lavazza decaffeinated ground coffee . 
the jelly belly people actually put real licorice in these jelly beans there is usually only one of the licorice beans in a bag of assorted beans , so if you love licorice , you can buy them solo these are authentic tasting and really good you ca n't beat jelly belly for flavor . 
i have met the creator inventor of the jelly belly and i can report with full confidence , that this is one tasty licorice jelly bean a jelly belly is smaller than jelly beans and that is why ronald reagan liked them so much my personal favorite flavor is licorice 5 stars ! . 
just because i sent an order of these jelly beans br to my oldest son in roswell , georgia he travels br a lot and enjoys a snack while he is driving and br he loves licorice jelly beans br br this would make a nice gift for any special person br in your life . 
i have 3 children under the age of 8 and work fulltime , so we are always on the go the happymorning product line has helped us immensely , not just in the mornings , but for afternoon snacks as well it is an easy way for my kids to grab a healthy snack while completing homework before we rush out the door to afternoon practices it is also an easy snack to toss in their lunchboxes and i do not have to worry about what they are eating while at school because they are not going to trade away their favorite snack ! the super banana in particular is my childrens' favorite they often fight over the last one ! . 
baby loves this flavor and great because all organic and no crap in it i give this to her breakfast lunch or dinner , not just for morning . 
these treats are perfect for my little dog i tried the assorted flavors , and it was too much for his sensitive stomach the plan treats are perfect he 's only 10 11 lbs , so these small treats are just right for his size i used to run out before i 'd remember to buy more , so i am doing amazon 's subscribe and save no more worries about running out . 
my tiny maltese loves these biscuts he is always ready for his cookie he goes to the place i keep them in and stands there looking at the door untill he gets 2 of them they are easy for his small mouth to chew and he loves them i tried the flavored ones but he did not like them as much as these and i did n't like them either because of the colors amazon why did you take these off subscribe and save \? my furbaby is not happy about that , nor am i ! please put these back on subscribe and save . 
my dog loves these small biscuits plain she loves playing with them and then eating them i tried the fancy flavored ones and she seemed to not really care for those then i bought some more of the plain small biscuits and she was happy again they help keep the teeth clean and to freshen the breath they have 12 minerals and vitamins they add some variety to her diet i am very happy with this product . 
my package was mailed out 1st and received on the 3rd in perfect condition the tap fit the bib with no trouble or leaks and is very easy to operate i had a few questions i emailed and received answers fast by the owner the 1 gallon box of syrup is much smaller than i thought it would be , about the size of a medium cheese cake box what i do is drain syrup into a washed out sodastream container and store it in the fridge the sodastream syrup cap has 3 circles in it , bottom , second and top the top circle is 2 oz so you would fill it to that 3 times just remember after carbonating you water you remove 4 oz of water or the 1 liter bottle will over flow when adding the 6 oz of syrup 1 gallon bibs are a good way to test if this is right for you before paying high price for the 5 gallon bibs . 
it is not cheap probably a little overpriced but very high quality ingredients no meat by products . 
vendor shipped promptly and the product arrived in excellent condition this is an extremely well made product containing no grain fillers i had to purchase the entire case , not knowing if my feline diners would even like it it would have been nice if the vendor would allow sample purchases of select varieties rather than an entire case . 
oats , for those who may not know , are a grain with a size and shape like barley or 'fat rice' there are three basic ways that the oat groats are prepared rolled , steel cut , and ground in the us , rolled oats are the predominant form and are the type found in the quaker oats box or granola steel cut oats are associated with ireland and are basically oats that have been chopped into even sized pieces ground oats , associated with scotland , are just that ground into relatively fine pieces these crackers are made with ground oats , olive oil , wheat flour , wheat bran , skim milk solids , salt , and baking soda note that there is no sugar and that salt is listed at the end these are not the kind of cracker that you eat plain \( although i enjoy them that way \) , but instead are designed to be used as a base for a canape , or served with a bit of jam if you want sweetness these are simple oat cakes that may not appeal to the american taste buds accustomed to sweet , flavored , salty crackers they are delicious and wholesome and make a good snack . 
this is the only way to fry fish if you start cooking with your fire too high , the fish will not get those annoying burn marks the fish fries evenly , a nice golden brown it adheres to the fish well and does not come off when flipping to the other side it tastes good i add a pinch of old bay seasoning and a pinch of sugar , shake up the mixture and then add the fish and shake again we have been using this stuff for years and i make perfect fish every time . 
in spite of this product being named cajun style , please do n't worry about it being too hot it has just the right amount of flavor not too overpowering and not too bland i fried some whiting with it and a family friend said it was the best fish he ever tasted br br a suggestion for those who like really crispy fish is to combine the product with corn meal before frying i use a 50 50 ratio br br buying it this way from amazon is a money saver because of the free shipping and amazon 's great price i saved about 1 25 a box \( compared to buying it from the supermarket \) also , having it shipped to me is much more convenient br br i fully recommend golden dipt cajun fish fry mix i believe you 'll be pleased buying it from amazon . 
cobblestone kitchen 's irish creme hot cocoa mix has got to be the most luxurious tasting cocoa on the market we originally bought this cocoa to use as a base for frappuccinnos but quickly decided it was way to good to waste in a mix the flavor is rich and smooth we have made it a part of our winding down for bed time procedure a couple of cups together and just relax br br cobblestone kitchen refers to the cocoas as delicious and decadent and they are being extremely modest . 
after several less successful stews with curry powder , i turned to this curry sauce mix br it is incredibly easy to get delicious curry stew with simple food stuffs , only with my basic cooking skills while imitating the way of cooking curry in animes br though it is my philosophy that good cuisine should be made from scratch , but his time i just surrendered to its convenience to get exactly the taste i want with such a simple process br one small problem is that it is too mild for me though it is labeled medium hot . 
my baby has n't died yet br br if your baby has food allergies and your doctor prescribes this stuff and you love your baby , it 's certainly worth every penny as expected , my daughter is still alive and she 's doing well . 
these are the best chocolate chips i 've ever tasted in my life yes , they are pricey but it does n't matter because they last forever and you use about half the amount of the regular ones due to the richness of them so so so good if you love chocolate , you will love these chips . 
but they were very tasty they arrived a bit soft , which was fine , as it is warmer out i opened the first one and was surprised by how good it was usually i am less than impressed with sugar free products but these hit the spot for five minutes then , i was craving another piece second one was just as good third and fourth followed pretty quickly as well if you like your caramels super chewy and soft , then you do n't need to refrigerate these i did n't refrigerate the first four pieces the second four , i stuck them in the fridge overnight the next morning , i had one as a pre coffee snack i could n't have just one at a time and i ate my second one soon after the refrigerated ones were just as good , if you like your caramels a little harder unfortunately , since i scarfed down this bag so fast , my stomach is not happy with me and i am unhappy as i have no more caramels if you are craving caramels , do n't want the sugar , do n't mind the maltitol effects , and can be content with one caramel a day , then these are for you . 
judy 's makes the best sugar free candy available so many sugar free candies are overloaded with aspertane , and that has its side and after effects these do n't . 
we found these sugar free caramels to be luxuriously delicious ! a pinch of sea salt heightenes the buttery sweet flavor br price is a little high but worth it for the quality ! . 
the quality of this tea is 5 star it is in sealed bags we 're trying it out to see if helps our nails skin . 
the 12 pack is a great gift idea because omaha steaks packages them in two boxes of 6 this makes it cheaper than the 6 pack if you are buying more than one quantity omaha is always fast at shipping too though i 've had other omaha steaks products , i have only purchased these as gifts , so i ca n't comment on taste . 
after purchasing these steaks for myself i found then to be so easy to store and very tasty when bbq 'd i decided to share them with my family and friends as gifts , they just loved them . 
my grandchildren love the sour gummy vitamins they really liked the sour gummy worms by rhino , but alas , i ca n't find them these were a good second choice the big problem is keeping them from eating more than 2 ! . 
i was glad to know that amazon has this product in their groceries section br though the shipping was individually priced , do n't know whether there was any option to pack the glass jars br anyway , i liked the fast service . 
from taste to texture , bionaturae makes the best pasta i have ever eaten i will never buy cheap grocery store brand pasta again . 
we have a little maltese that we spoil to no end these treats are the perfect size for him and he loves them br br he can be a little picky among his daily treats are greenies and since we found these on amazon , zuke 's jerky naturals i will say that we tried two different kinds along with these , we tried the a href http www amazon com gp product b000mlkxou wellness wellbites chicken and venison recipe dog treats , 8 ounce pouch a br br the zuke 's are really potent when you open the bag , you catch a big whiff of how strong they are they 're probably real flavorful because of it \( i did n't try one \) the wellness treats seem a little dryer while our little guy likes both of the treats , the zuke 's win over the wellness plus they 're cheaper so that 's even better he ca n't get enough of them br br we also tried the a href http www amazon com gp product b001mwrt18 zuke 's z ridge mini carrot fresh breath dental chew bones , 15 count pouch a made by zuke 's he does n't like those as much as the greenies br br i would say that this product is one of the best we found for our dog plus we were able to take advantage of the free super saver shipping as well these are highly recommended br br edit august 14 , 2011 br br he still loves them ! br br we 've had to start giving our little guy remedel for a little shoulder injury he had these zukes make it real easy to give him the pill since they 're moist , we just put the pill inside and press it all around the pill that way he does n't even know he 's taking it trying to give him pills with the wellness treats does n't work so well since they 're dryer br br edit september 29 , 2012 br br anyone else notice that they seem different \? \? the last couple packs we bought were dryer and brittle they also were n't as potent as the other ones were he does n't seem to like them as much any more i do n't know if the bags we bought were partially opened so they dried out by the time the were delivered or if their recipe changed i 'll buy some more and see how they turn out a little disappointed . 
i have a geriatric mini poodle he ca n't chew biscuits or rawhide textures , but these treats are soft enough and still provide some workout for his gums and remaining teeth br i appreciate the fact that the ingredients are domestic and it is manufactured in the us . 
my golden retriever loves them you can chop them into squares if you want smaller treats . 
these are not the tough , durable jerky that i was expecting , but small , soft , chewy squares they break up easily into tiny bb sized balls \( maybe 12 per square \) and my puppies will do anything for them ! best dang training aide on the market ! . 
my dog loves the how these treats smell and taste they are special treats for her they 're healthy , mildly chewy , low calorie treats so it 's perfect they are a good compliment to her regular chicken jerky treats \( from canyon creek ranch \) br i usually divide each into 2 or 4 pieces while training . 
my murphy \( soft coated wheaten terrier \) loves these treats they are his special treat that brings him back in a heated run when we call him ! . 
our dogs love these healthy treats i like them because they have no wheat , corn or soy in them the soft squares make a nice sized treat for our little girls notice that the first ingredient is lamb , an uncommon luxury for a dog treat . 
i'm constantly looking for healthy dog treats that are not crazy expensive these are one of the better deals i could find when considering cost ounce my lab absolutely loves them and they are good for him too the treats are soft and moist , which is a plus for my dog they could easily be broken into smaller pieces , but i generally just give my dog a whole one when he does something good i would n't keep them in my pocket because they do smell a bit it 's not an overly offensive smell , but strong enough that you do n't want to carry it around with you all day br br i definitely recommend these for all dogs . 
these treats are one of my dog 's favorites ! i like this company , they make a lot of great treats , and the ingredients are from the u s . 
we normally do n't buy expensive treats \( tend to stick to dry biscuits \) , but we got these for all of the family dogs as stocking stuffers for christmas they were a huge hit ! our dog is willing to do anything imaginable to get one of these my boyfriend 's mom , who totally spoils her portie , had n't seen these before , and her dog loved these like crazy as well , so she went out bought a bunch more when they ran out also , they 're natural and there are no shady ingredients , so they are good for your pooch ! br br just to clarify , these do n't actually have the consistency of jerky they are little squares of what looks like pressed meat product clearly , our dogs do not care and consume these with great enthusiasm , so still very highly recommended ! . 
these treats are excellent i have a chihuahua who has done obedience training and is now in agility training i use the treats to aid with his training as they are easy to break into small pieces yet big enough for me to carry in my pocket and grab easily br br they have never made him sick no matter how many he eats during a training session and he goes absolutely nuts when he hears me open the bag br br i 've purchased the smaller sized treats by zukes , but they seem to be harder and are too big to offer a small dog as a treat , yet too difficult to split into smaller pieces so , i find the square shaped ones to be much easier to use for training br br they can get hard if the bag is left open so you need to make sure to close the bag immediately i read another poster mention that putting a damp paper towel in the bag will restore the moisture to the treats , so i 'll have to try that if i forget to close a bag , which happens br br overall a healthy and practical treat ! i'm really glad i found these . 
ernie , my pooch , loves these treats he 'll do trick or command just to get his zuke ! br seriously , these things will make your dog do anything so , buy two bags ! . 
great product , i am new to the brand but have fallen in love with these products not as soft as one reviewer states to replace a pill pocket very hard to findbin stores , so the best place to buy is here . 
my dog is very picky , to say the least he 's super cute , but is very picky about treats he wo n't eat any biscuits , does n't like most fake meat treats , and wo n't eat bacon because of this , he has hurt many an eager pet shop employee 's feelings however , he loves these treats we just adopted him from the shelter , and his previous owners did n't teach him much these treats are making training so much easier he 'll do almost anything for them br br they 're pretty big , so you can rip them up into much smaller pieces they will dry out if you leave the package open , so they have to be sealed each time br br i know i'm echoing most of the other reviews when i say this , but these are fantastic treats . 
my dog loves these treats in all varieties they are easy to break in half as well the resealable bag is a plus . 
great ! i have a dog who is very allergic to lots of stuff and this is safe for him because of no grain corn wheat etc the dogs love the taste i use them for training br . 
this is a good product with great price i received the treat and was very pleased with the product and package . 
my dog is a service dog and she is kind of out in the woods lots so this is a very good training tool and treat plus i can share them with other dog 's if i see fit . 
my dog lives for these treats ! ca n't wait to see us leave in the morning when i give him a few . 
the lamb jerky soft treats are the first product we tried from zuke 's they were a big hit and continue to be one of my little schnoodle 's favorite treats br soft jerky squares \( approx 1 \) can easily be split into 3 4 pieces we use them for her training play sessions and she seems to especially love it when the reward is the zuke 's soft lamb jerky br although she performs just as eagerly when the reward is the a href http www amazon com gp product b00292bm7c zuke 's 16 ounce mini bakes dog treats , peanut butter n' blueberryz a or the zuke 's mini bakes chicken n' cherry so i guess we 're stickin' with zuke 's . 
i try to stick to all natural products in my household that goes double for my dog she is a super mutt with a strong stomach , but that does n't mean i want to take any chances these seem like quality treats and she really enjoys them i have purchased several flavors and she loves them all will definitely buy them again . 
they smell rather smokey , so i was n't sure my dogs would like them they are rather particular but they love them just re ordered more ! . 
my boston terrier loves these ! they are great kong toy fillers besides being tasty , they are made in america and they are nourishing highly recommend ! . 
my dog loves zuke 's treats and this one is no acceptation he did not like them as much as the chicken but they still keep his interest i will be cutting them up to use at puppy class zukes are the only thing other than hotdogs that will get his attention . 
i use this to train my dog and while he is a picky snacker , he usually likes these they go a longer way too since i break them into pieces . 
my 4 month old puppy loves these , and has even learned how to go to bed in order to get his paws on one ! zuke 's is quite a consistent brand , and our pup loves everything we have bought by this company so far my husband and i like knowing we 're giving him a tasty treat that 's also natural and is made in america amazon usually has these for a little bit cheaper than most of the pet stores in our area , which is also nice ! . 
buster is a recovering shelter dog , and a little picky in his eating sometimes i 've tried a lot of food treats , and some things he wo n't eat at all or is allergic to \( note he has no problems with steak that i 've seen , lol \) br br the zuke 's line of products are now his favorites i 've tried several items in the zuke 's line , and he loves all of them the jerky naturals lamb has a strong smell , \( thus a strong flavor too , i guess \) and he really goes for that br br usa made too , so all in all , highly recommended ! . 
i am impressed with the quality of these dog treats amazon seems to sell these treats for the best price and i will continue to order these in the future my dog really likes the lamb variety and they smell very good i reccommend these to any animal lover ! . 
our 3 month old puppy loves these ! she would do anything to get one i love the ingredients , and knowing that i'm giving my dog something good for her we 've had the bag for a few days now and they 're still as soft as ever , which is great these treats do kinds smell but that should mean they 're delicious to a dog right \? \) . 
these are great treats ! , love that these are all natural ! plus my puppy loves the size of them easy for him to eat . 
this is very good dog treat our chihauhua loves them it is her favorite they are semisoft , so the older dogs with few teeth can enjoy them . 
our two dogs just love these treats one old and one younger but both are active the older dog 's teeth are n't the best these treats are easy for him to chew it seems like the younger one swallows them whole he 's so eager to get them ! oh , and watch your fingers too \) . 
dogs love 'em ! ! i mix the treats in their dog food and they wolf it down within a minute . 
what more can i ask for \? great ingredients and my dog loves these she 'll do back flips for em very good great price too . 
these treats are probably the healthiest treat i 've ever given my dogs ! they smell so good i actually want to try them \( but have n't done it yet ! \) my 3 dogs absolutely love them . 
these treats are all natural so i feel good about rewarding my one year old yellow labrador , and she appears to really enjoy the size and the texture as well as the taste of zuke's . 
my 2 doxies have liked everything that zukes makes however , i think the lamb jerky is their favorite nice and smelly , just what a dog wants . 
labs are n't known to be picky eaters \( gross understatement , i know \) but wow , these zuke 's are at the top of their we 'll do anything , just please can we have one list no toxic stuff in them , either . 
my miniature schnauzer just loves these treats ! that 's the best review i can give doggy treats . 
i had a really picky dog who refuses any kind of biscuit type treat offered to him he eats some soft treats and loves these . 
my minature schnauzer loves these treats ! i sometimes get the mini treats in chicken so i can give him a few throughout the day or on walks i do not want him to get overweight since he is a small boy i would highly recommend them \) . 
my dog loves these snacks and they do n't have artificial ingredients br br they come in a resealable bag which is good they do get a bit hard if they are not kept sealed up . 
our bischon loves these treats , so does our cat ! and we love that they have fresh fruits and veggies in them ! yeah ! . 
my dog will do just about anything for this treat also , each treat can be cut easily into for small pieces for training ingredients listed are good quality i had no ill effects from giving to my dog beef was the flavor i purchased this time . 
my min pin , snickers seems to enjoy the heck out of these small treats they are the perfect size for his tiny little mouth thank you . 
we started off our dog with zuke 's mini treats as puppy rewards now that she is bigger , she needs more these natural treats fit easily inside her kong toys and in the middle of her everlasting treat balls and give her something different we recommend zuke 's to everyone my dogs love them and they are made without corn fillers or by products , which are 2 things i check for when purchasing any treats . 
these treats went over really well with our three dogs they 're about 1 inch square pieces , so they 're a good size for our larger dogs i also really like that they have high quality ingredients and do n't give our dogs the smellies like milkbones do . 
my dogs go crazy when they smell these they are great for training too i put them in their kong toys also and that keeps them busy for a while . 
well my dog seems to like these very much let 's see if someone can offer free shipping on these . 
it 's difficult to tell from the pictures and the description , but these are n't really jerky \( dried strips of meat \) but are smallish , moist , chewy treats made from meat and other ingredients i suppose meat goop formed into a shape think pringle vs a potato chip anyway , our dog seems to approve not sure it even touched the sides ! the beef , lamb and salmon varieties she tried all disappear in the blink of an eye a tasty treat for your dog , made in the usa , but just not the jerky i was hoping for . 
this blueberry and vanilla tea is excellent ! i love all kinds of tea , and friend gave me some of this blueberry and vanilla \( and a couple other dilmah varieties \) they 're all great , but this is one of my favorites the blueberry vanilla taste is delicious but not overpowering i usually add milk and sugar to my tea , but this one does n't need it i highly recommend it ! . 
bought through amazon as snap bits are difficult to find in pet stores my dog is on a diet and the only treats she can have are few cheerios , baby carrots cut into little pieces \( and yes she eats them \) and ice cubes snap bits are her extra special treat and she knows when they are in my hand she really likes it when i roll one along the floor for her to chase after and chomp it down . 
these are nice little training treat sized cookies that can easily be gobbled by my 50 and 75lb dogs i imagine they 'd work good too for the smaller dogs as a more regular sized treat they are about the size of a nickel each . 
very light in taste , but very giood , ty ! also , very fast service ! i really enjoyed this prodect ! i would order this again ! ty ! . 
i am a huge coffee drinker , and love the k cups for making one cup quickly before leaving for work in the morning while there are many choices , i prefer a bold , strong coffee first thing in the morning wolfgang puck french roast is absolutely delicious , strong and not at all bitter , and makes a great first cup of coffee i would highly recommend to all bold coffee drinkers ! . 
we always drink timmothy 's or emeril 's thought we would try something different not too many decafs to choose from we were pleasantly surprised that this had a great taste with a full bodied flavor i like my coffee on the milder side so i can even get 2 cups from 1 kcup . 
good subtle flavored coffee for the mid afternoon pick me up a bit of sweetness without being overdone wish it was available in whole bean as i like it stronger then the keurig cup can make it . 
wolfgang puck 's chef 's reserve colombian \( dark roast \) is basically what they said it will be dark roast , but not too strong acidity is on a low side , but with plenty of pleasant taste at the same time you can drink this coffee black w o the need for the sweetener and or milk this coffee is in european tradition and will please many people i would recommend it after dinner , but not if you need a jolt to wake you up . 
i purchased these for my mom and she loves them ! she does not like bold coffee flavors , but is more into the sweet and more flavorful varieties this one combines the taste of the islands with a smooth , nutty flavor amazon had a great price on these and this is something that i can actually recommend ! . 
i admit i do n't usually drink decaf but this is a favorite in my office and i felt it deserved a good rating . 
i tried this flavor within a variety pack and loved it ! i usually add cream and sugar to my coffee with this k cup i added coconut creamer and found that i did not have to add any sugar ! it was so sweet and light and tasted just like a pina colada i absolutley love this k cup and am planning to sign up for subscribe and save on this one ! . 
this wolfgang puck coffee tasted great the vanilla flavoring is just right some reviews said it was not so good , not enough flavoring , etc do n't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here i have never posted for a product and i have tried many different k cups this is a good k cup and do n't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback i almost hesitated and did n't buy it and then i figured i would give it a shot it was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor you will enjoy it it tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor . 
i saw the good reviews of this jamaica me crazy coffee , but the reviewers all seem to wander around whether it has coconut , vanilla , caramel , rum or coffee liqueur flavorings br br first off , i'm not getting any coconut from it at all some vanilla , but it mostly tastes like coffee with baileys irish cream in it br br in fact , after i drank a cup i had to go pick up my son from kindergarten and it occurred to me that some of the other parents might think i was drinking spiked coffee while we waited for the class to let out ! \) br br but its good i recommend it to anyone who likes flavored coffee not really anything else like it and i 've tried about 20 different k cup flavors . 
i used to do the subscribe and save with the timothy 's world kona , but due to the fact that the price on timothy 's jumped so high , i went to wolfgang puck breakfast in bed pleasantly surprised , and i must say that i like this one much better than the kona ! it seems much more smoother , but the taste still retains a nice warm mellow bold flavor great way to start the day ! oh , and i love the name of this coffee \) . 
i was n't expecting this one to be so rich or full ! yet it has a smoky finish that is typical of a french roast but does n't taste burnt i think alot of times a french roast tastes thin and yet bitter instead of full and smoky , but not this one ! very pleased with it and will definitely order again if you like a stronger cup in the morning , without being bitter , give this one a try . 
i am still waiting for peets to come out with kcups , but in the meantime , the wolfgang puck 's coffees are filling the bill i really like sorrento and rodeo drive smooth and full bodied br js . 
not too bold , not too weak not bitter good way to start if your not into the real strong coffees my husband and i have added the wolfgang puck breakfast in bed line and the rodeo drive flavors to our buying ritual . 
never had hawaiian hazelnut before so i did n't know what to expect , but it turns out it 's pretty good , not as flavored as say dd , but nonetheless pretty good i have it on subscription now along with the german chocolate cake , another one of my favorite flavored k cups . 
this has made me into a coffee lover ! very mild and easy on the stomach , but with a great flavor love it ! . 
nice , light cup of coffee definitely not a bold brew but it 's smooth and gentle on the stomach good for those mornings when you over did it the night before would buy again . 
this is a very balanced and smooth light coffee great for a first cup of the day . 
this is a great cup of hazelnut coffee smooth and balanced with no chemical aftertaste my husband and i like it so much that we 've ordered it twice directly from the keurig manufacturer so glad that it 's now available on amazon through subscribe and save ! . 
i'm amazed how many are being so easily fooled what you 're seeing is a generic ingredient list that covers multiple coffees what it is saying , based on the photo i see above , is that if the coffee type you have is straight coffee , then all it contains is 100 arabica coffee but if what you are drinking is a flavored coffee , then the ingredients in it are arabica coffee , and flavorings but if what you 're drinking is a decaf variety , then it contains arabica coffee that has been decaffeinated with ethyl acetate , as is standard br br so if you 're not holding a decaf variety , then there is no decaffeinated beans ! it is nothing more than generic catch all ingredients that apply to whichever variety you happen to be looking at br br sheesh think people ! lol . 
rodeo drive is my absolute favorite and i'm ready to order more ! that 's if i can find it br i do n't know why they are discontinuing it br it arrived very fast . 
honestly , i have to admit that i expected a little better that 's not to say that this is bad coffee in fact it 's quite bold without being too acidic , and pretty satisfying overall i think my main problem is that wolfgang puck 's name is attached to it , so perhaps it set my expectations a little high i have a wolfgang puck knife set that i adore , and is very high quality for what i paid for it this coffee was on sale , so it was well worth it also , i just hoped for something that would knock my socks off which it did n't i also purchased the breakfast blend , and jamaica me crazy at the same time the breakfast blend was the best , in my opinion , and the jamaican coffee smelled the best , but was the least successful . 
the breakfast in bed coffee from wolfgang puck is a good medium roast coffee my husband , the regular coffee drinker of our house , likes it , but feels he would like the coffee more if it were a bit stronger the product arrived quite soon after ordering . 
the wolfgang puck coffee , chef 's reseerve columbian decaf is fantastic and very delicious i definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a great cup of coffee . 
nice round flavor not harsh or botter i enjoy it with french vanilla creamer lately it has been harder to find i do hope they have not discontinued it ! . 
this is my wife 's favorite she grew up in seattle and has consumed countless gallons of various types of coffee in her lifetime so i assume this is good coffee she is also my wine taster as her palate is much more sensitive than mine . 
love this coffee , but cannot buy it through regular outlets , so am gouged by sasa corner really sticks in my craw paying more than a buck a cup . 
we were given a keurig for a wedding present , along with several variety packs so far , wolfgang puck 's jamaica me crazy is our favorite , and we will definitely be repeat buyers of this flavor . 
this is my favorite late evening cup of coffee nice flavor , just right before retiring for the night keep stocking this brand and i will keep coming back for it ! ! . 
it 's a great flavor and makes a great cup of coffee i fine you can have more than 1 cup of this coffee and not feel like it 's too much of a flavored coffee puck has captured a great flavor with this coffee . 
i love the wolfganag puck flavors this vienna blend is very nice it is medium roast so it is not too strong has a wonderful flavor without being a flavored coffee one of my favorites . 
we purchased an assorted package of k cups \( by various makers \) and of all the coffees this is my fave ! i really ca n't see any reason to ever taste test another flavor ! it smells delicious and tastes delicious too ! ! . 
never got a delivery as fast as we did this time we were running low on our special coffee we have sampled many k cup coffees , some in assorted packs and decided this is the best it is mellow , never bitter and always totally enjoyable . 
this is my second favorite after the breakfast in bed flavor i love wolfgang puck coffee it 's a little bolder then the breakfast in bed , but still smooth . 
this is our favorite k cup at home mellow and flavorful br br also , i wanted to clear up the question of whether or not this is decaf it is not see the response i received from wp coffee br br is breakfast in bed k cup actually a decaf coffee \? br br thanks for reaching out to wolfgang puck coffee the breakfast in bed is not a decaf blend br br thanks br mandy m br customer service br wolfgang puck coffee . 
the hawaiian hazelnut is my favorite k cup flavor from any vendor , but it 's always out of stock on amazon com it seems that all of the other puck flavors are available for a very reasonable 16 54 24 cup price and sold directly by amazon com , but hh 's price fluctuates wildly from 3rd party resellers and has n't been available directly from amazon com for months as i'm writing this \( 8 24 12 \) the price of a 24 pack is 34 99 from the cheapest 3rd party retailer , which is absolutely ridiculous amazon , why ca n't you stock the hawaiian hazelnut the same way you stock the other flavors \? \? the fact that i would take the time to write a review about this should tell you how much i like the product . 
this is just the perfect thing to end a tired day the taste is smooth and warm and creamy i find that i look forward to having a cup while i read for a few minutes what a treat . 
this is good vanilla coffee i got this and the green mountain and prefer this one it has a nice sweet flavor . 
wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut coffee for keurig brewer good medium strength coffee with hazelnut flavor full body , enjoyable anytime of the day i really like this coffee . 
i really enjoy wolfgang puck 's k cups , so far all the ones i 've tried have n't left my stomach churning and , br br this was my first time trying out the sorrento fair trade roast and purchased it on a warehouse amazon price deal i am really happy with my purchase the taste of the sorrento is what i would expect of a medium roast a good , smooth blend no bitter , acidic after taste , and leaves you wanting for more after that first cup ! \( at least , it left me \) ! p it 's does n't leave you with the shhhakes either , it has that right balance you need with your daily cup of coffee br br yes , i will be getting another 24 count of this when i am finished with this pack ! br br 5 stars ! . 
coffee quality is as good as expected but , close to expiring next time , i will spend the extra few dollars and buy the coffee localy . 
i'm a relative newcomer to keurig coffee , but i do know that i was generally disappointed in the drink produced however , the breakfast in bed k cup produces a nicely balanced , not too thin cup without being too harsh i still have n't achieved anything like what i can make either with my french press or with my drip machine , but it 's definitely better than the at work alternative , community coffee . 
if you like a balanced cup of joe , this is a great choice the coffee is smooth and balanced there is no bitterness or bite thank you chef puck for this fantastic decaf coffee choice ! . 
smooth with a hint of flavor medium boldness yet rich in taste not a wake me up but certainly enjoyable ! . 
my second purchase of this cofee like the first cup it has been wonderful to wake up to not too bold or brash but a good drink to start the day with . 
the best thing that i look foreward to every morning it makes my day , the best tasting coffee ever . 
i really enjoy this one and i 've tried many ! in my top 5 a little pricey but will order again sometime in the future . 
i too purchased this product thinking it might not be a flavored product , and before it arrived i looked it up to see that there was some rumor as to a coconut flavor br br so , lets get this out of the way do not purchase this is you do not like flavored coffee it is flavored br br the first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma , almost akin to hazelnut in its presentation the initial mouthfeel is good , a light roast but a snappiness to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor , which br has a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness br br the finish is semisweet chocolate , jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut br br bottom line if you like flavored coffee with coconut hazelnut cocoa profiles , you will like this coffee . 
jamaica me crazy is an awesome smooth coffee , light coconut vanilla flavorful taste br a good coffee if you do n't like real strong coffee highly recommend . 
i got one k cup of wolfgang puck 's colombian reserve dark roast as part of a variety 35 pack that i bought here on amazon since i 'd always assumed that i preferred the less burnt flavor of a light or medium roast , i was pleasantly surprised that i enjoyed the way this coffee sat on my tongue it is sweet , full , and gently bitter i brewed it in a 9 25 oz cup in an effort to dilute it a little , but i may be gutsy enough to try a 7 25 oz cup the next time around . 
smooth , delicious , ca n't wait to wakeup with my coffee ! i love all the wolfgang puck coffee flavors never a dull flavor ! . 
this is our first time trying the wolfgang puck coffee so glad we did ! ! ! it is a wonderful medium blend and great for any time of day ! i would buy it again ! . 
this is the best k cup coffee that we have been able to find very rich flavors and a medium roast we love this one ! . 
i'm not a huge flavored coffee fan usually i prefer lattes with flavored syrups a friend sent me a k cup to try and the smell was mouth watering before it even finished brewing the flavor was strong enough to drink it only with milk i added a little vanilla syrup when i reheated it i am not a coconut fan but the flavor is barely there it is just a unique taste for when you 're in the mood for something different ! . 
i loved this brand it was the best vanilla flavor of others i tried i would buy more if it was a better price . 
fantastic taste , smooth feel , no nasty aftertaste , pairs great with creamer what more can one want from a coffee \? this has become my favorite . 
best flavored k cup i 've ever had ! i recommend this for everyone great flavor ! i 've given it to all my friends and they get hooked . 
i did n't know what this would taste like , but i'm so glad i ordered it what a perfect cup of yummy coffee for a cool summer morning ! . 
wake up to a cup of wolfgang puck coffe breakfast in bed \( medium roast \) k cup for keurig is a great way to start your day , or just sit down and relax try it and you will be buying more br br shop amazon for wolfgang puck coffee , breakfast in bed . 
this is a favorite in the office and in my house we burn through this coffee i 've tried a few of the other wolfgang coffees and this one is by far the best i 've seen better prices for this at a lot of other places this is an excellent coffee to start your day with . 
i 've tried a wide selection of k cups including the big names like starbucks , tully 's , donut house , dunkin donuts , etc and they all have something in common either too watery \( weak \) or too bitter \( strong \) i tried breakfast in bed based on the reviews and i was not disappointed it 's flavorful without being strong or weak it 's hard to get a cup of coffee from a keurig that tastes like it was brewed like a normal coffee machine this k cup is the exception i 'll be stocking up . 
wonderful flavor would purchase this blend of coffee again light flavor not bitter at all and price was great the best i found anywhere . 
i find many of the k cups are a bit bitter for my taste i want something simple and smooth this coffee is wonderful ! . 
wolfgang puck 's colombian coffee is delicious ! i find it to be a smooth and flavorful dark roast with a lovely aroma , yet without a bitter or acidic quality that might leave an unpleasant aftertaste it is a bit expensive , like all k cups , but i think it 's worth it due to convenience and exceptional flavor i definitely recommend this coffee to others ! . 
not much of a coffee drinker but this wolfgang vienna brand is good not strong but a mellow taste the flavored coffees are getting on my nerves and this is just a good everyday coffee flavor everyone in the family and visitors like it would buy again . 
i truly enjoy a good cup of coffee it does give me a lift in the morning wolfgang puck really knows how to produce a fine cup thanks . 
great service and delivery for a really good product i am constantly looking for a good hazelnut coffee and so far this is the best , along with green mountain . 
my family is full of coffee snobs if you like robust coffee and use k cups , this is the product for you . 
while i love flavored coffees , i had never tried any of the wolfgang puck line this moved to the top of my favorites list with the first cup ! not only is the aroma delightful , the flavor is excellent as well i drink my coffee black and this one has no bitter after taste and the flavor is n't overpowering the flavor is a very light coconut and the coffee is a medium body i must admit that i was a little hesitant about a coconut flavor don't be ! everyone around me wants a cup i refuse to share ! .

i love the rich , full bodied flavor of a dark roast coffee when i bought my first keurig machine i wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast k cups that i could find i initially settled on newman 's own dark roast as my go to coffee , but i did n't stop there i like to keep experimenting and looking for something new i happened to find coffee people 's organic extra bold blend and was blown away it has been my favorite ever since i first tried it last week i saw a listing for a colombian dark roast sold under the wolfgang puck name \( it is processed and distributed by van houtte \) and decided to give it try here is my impression of it br br after brewing a cup \( i used the 7 1 2 oz setting \) the first thing that i noticed was that it did n't have that freshly brewed aroma that the coffee people x bold does , however the taste was another story it hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice , sharp bite that gets your attention right away the finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice \( nutmeg or cinnamon \? \) and just a slight , lingering , pleasant bitterness i really like this coffee but i think that i will stick with coffee people 's extra bold and this will be my back up brand however , i will keep looking for something new who knows what i will find \? br br a href http www amazon com gp product b001eo7gyy newman 's own iquest organics special blend \( extra bold \) , k cups for keurig brewers , 24 count , boxes \( pack of 2 \) a br a href http www amazon com gp product b002l444oq coffee people organic , extra bold k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 50 \) amazon frustration free packaging a . 
ok , now on our third box of breakfast in bed we had become fans of donut house and coffee shop , looking for that balanced smooth dunkinesque brew we found ourselves coming up just a bit short in the strength flavor area corrections were made in brew size and eventually adding in a bit of emeril 's bold or various dark roasts well problem solved with the b in b smooth and flavorful and a good eye opener \( was worried the name somehow implied less caffeine \) based on our experience in these areas , 5 stars the except \? on three seperate occasions out of two boxes purchased seperately , we had exploding k cups ! a small pop during brewing that sent coffee grounds spewing over and in the keurig , counter top , and coffee cup this at our home brewer and our vacation house messy very messy , requiring unplugging and careful cleaning inside cup holder and area minus 1 star umm , exactly who makes these things and where hopefully a road bump on the way to sucess peace . 
i have this flavor shipped automatically now , along with several others this happens to be our favorite , and i have to remind my husband the two boxes need to last until the next shipment a slight coconut aroma and flavor is so amazingly delightful in the morning not overly strong , and perfect for our taste buds our favorite part of waking up in the morning ! . 
first you must know i am one who roasts my own green beans at home , including sumatran , but also many african varieties i like a strong cup of coffee i use k cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing cleaning getting water for a regular machine br br sumatran coffees generally have a very rich , earthy taste some would describe it as being tangy almost having tried the two other main brands of sumatran for k cups , the puck is by far the best it is not as bold as something you would get from starbucks or from roasting yourself , but it has all the flavor elements of a good sumatran cup it especially has that nice earthy taste even the aftertaste is rich br br important if you are looking for a k cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting , this coffee is not for you in my opinion you get a sumatran because you love strong coffee watered down it loses its distinctiveness get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor i make mine with 2 k cups , at the smallest setting by camparison , i would give a starbucks sumatra mandheling a 10 10 rating for boldness the puck is about an 8 , the diedrich is a 4 br i highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers , provided you use the smallest cup setting you will not be disappointed best k cup i have had yet , and i have tried many newman , timothy 's , donut shop , diedrich , etc br br addendum i have since tried th green mountain sumatran , and gave that a one star stale and bitter i will definitely stay with puck 's . 
i bought a wolfgang puck sampler and this was certainly one of my favorites , so i ordered a bigger box and have truly been enjoying it this is a classic , medium roast cup of coffee it 's very smooth , with no bitterness i would say that if you enjoy donut shop , tully 's kona , and caribou , you will like this blend the label is adorable and makes me smile when i pop it in the keurig each morning . 
my favorite flavored coffee ! ! ! this is not available in any of my local stores better price than i have found at any local stores as well . 
been trying every coffee brand and flavor for over a year now and this is it i just love this coffee you should try a small box and see if you agree everyone has a different taste for coffee so you may not like it , but worth a try i always say if you don't buy a lotto ticket you will never win . 
if you liked flavored coffees , this one has a hint of coconut to it this is my favorite coffee by far i look forward to my first cup every morning . 
i love this coffee great taste and great way to start your morning if you like flavored coffee you will like this . 
these k cups are great ! the coffee is mild and yummy , but still very flavorful i love this , cant wait to get my next shipment ! . 
i caught this as a warehouse deal 18 09 for 48 k cups this was my first experience with any wolfgang puck coffee br the rodeo drive blend is good , average coffee nothing exceptional i prefer a little stronger , bolder coffee , but at this price , it works for me there 's other brands that i like a little better , but with k cups , cost per unit is always something i have to factor in br i 'd buy it again 0 38 cup , but i probably would n't full price if you keep your eyes peeled , you can always find a good deal just have to be patient and stock up when the deals arise . 
this is great coffee i am a coffee purist i do n't add cream or sugar \( unless it is weak or bitter \) i truly enjoy coffee i have tried many different types of coffee for k cups this is my new favorite the price was amazing too very smooth and subtle hazelnut flavor , not overpowering . 
well we were looking for another coffee that would meet or exceed the k cups we were using and this has far out tasted the coffee cups we were using , i have bought almost 6 packages of these and used just about all of them and will be ordering a few more boxes here soon great coffee , from a regular guy point of view . 
take it from someone who was tried a lot of different k cups , buy these ! the breakfast in bed blend is full of great flavor , roasted perfectly , and more importantly i have been choosing it over green mountain , which says a lot it 's true to its name , perfect for the morning . 
reading the previous comments people have stated they did not know this was a flavored coffee but it clearly states that it is atleast it did on the sight i bought mine from i was only brought to amazon for the secure payment feature it 's a delightful flavored coffee , \( depending on how you brew it \) , and is a pleasant wake up any morning . 
i did not know this had a coconut flavor or aroma as i got it in a variety pack i put it in this am and immediately smelled coconut and thought oh no i do n't like sweet in the am but its not sweet , i am quite surprised at the flavor and how i like it would i like it every morning no but it was a nice change made me feel i was waking up in a jamacian cottage on the ocean hearing carribean music , well maybe not but it was close . 
i have tried many different k cups and this has remained my favorite for the longest time it is the perfect balance , not too weak and not too bold and since i usually drink my coffee black , the flavor alone is very important to me it' has a great flavor and not too acidic . 
amazon had this as buy one get one free and since it was my favorite , i could not resist great purchase . 
this product is great tasting and you do n't even need sugar or creamer , but if you like sweet coffee i 'd say a little sugar and creamer would not hurt , this is a perfect product to wake up to every morning \) . 
this coffee is so smoothe i brew my morning cup with the medium cup size and it is delicious it is a little weak on the large cup size setting . 
this is a smooth not bitter coffee it 's a little more pricey than some which are just as good , but it has a good sweet flavor , and i can recommend it . 
i bought a small 3 pack of this locally and liked it so much i bought the 48 pack great deal on amazon . 
bought a sample pack today of the jamaica me crazy and love the flavor the flavor is not too powerful nor was it overwhelming i 'd recommend the wolf gang puck k cups . 
i personally do n't like strong coffee if you like weaker coffee , then this blend is a great choice for you other reviews on here say that its too weak , which is probably true if your used to something strong br br i also use flavored creamer to further enhance the taste for the price , it ca n't hurt to give it a try . 
this is the smoothest and best tasting keurig coffee i 've tried it 's not bitter , not too weak , not too strong , just right ! . 
these are awesome as are all of wolfgang puck 's k cups the coffee is smooth , the cups brew perfectly , the taste is unbelievable ! my husband and i are hooked on these the price is great considering what amazing coffee this is ! ! . 
wolfgang puck's french roast has a deep robust flavor i prefer it in the afternoon sometimes with a shot of gran marnier oh yeah . 
i 've tried every single french roast k cup , and this is one of my favorites the starbucks and the barista prima are the two best french roast k cups , but the gap between wolfgang puck 's and those two are negligible this one has that great sweet smoky flavor that every good french roast should have . 
this one is my wife 's favorite of all the hazlenut blends she has tried this is her go to after a busy day of being retired br delivery was exceptional as usual , could not ask for much more . 
my husband used to like the nantucket blend saying that it was awesome then he tried this one , and it 's the only one he drinks i drink other flavors , but i like taking sips of this one for sure my husband is very territorial over these cups and says it 's the only one he drinks if you 're a coffee drinker , definitely try this one ! . 
i drink my coffee black , so quality is a must ! this is an excellent medium roast with a smooth consistency and perfect amount of kick i love all the wolfgan puck coffee k cups , but this is absolutely my favorite ! . 
one of my top favorites , it 's infused with coconut and has a very unique flavor this coffee is best enjoyed without cream or sugar , and it will ether become one of your favorites or you 'll never buy it again some of my other favorites are vanilla biscotti , butter toffee , hawaiian hazelnut , and donut shop . 
i drink a lot of coffee and i buy several different types i found this particular one to be pleasant tasting with a nice aroma while brewing there is no after taste so you always want another cup . 
wonderful tasty coffee with a nice aroma as it is brewing there is no after taste at all and it very satisfying , you always want another cup of coffee i continue to buy it . 
a very nice flavor with no after taste it gives off a nice fragrance while brewing and has a very satisfying taste you have to have another cup ! . 
dark and full flavored , but distinctly columbian this is a great morning coffee better cup of am joe than you will get at a coffee place . 
there is so many different k cup to chose from so i asked in the store what brand and flavor is bought the most they suggested wolfgang puck coffee breakfast in bed the only had a few on the shelf and i was not disappointed now i am hooked for you people that use creamer , this coffee is so good you will not even need creamer . 
my favorite of the wolfgang series discovered when trying all of the flavors in the available sample pack very good flavor , consistent with each pod and not overdone with added flavors very good dark roast colombian cup of coffee from the wolf . 
we have tried all of the hazelnut flavored coffee brands this is by far the best to bad it is n't an auto ship . 
there 's not much i can say that has n't already been said but when i brewed this coffee i really was n't expecting to like it at all , seeing as i do n't normally like coconut flavored things but i really like the blend of flavors to me it does n't really taste like coconut as much as it does just tropical ness in general it 's like palm tree flavored coffee and the flavor is n't too overpowering at all , it still has a nice coffee taste it 's just right . 
this is a dark , smooth brew \( darker than timothy 's french vanilla \) , but as with timothy 's it has only a slight hint of vanilla this is my third taste test searching for the best vanilla flavored coffee gloria jean 's was undrinkable timothy 's was pleasant but not as deep a roast as this if it only had more vanilla flavor this would be my hands down favorite . 
i 've tried lots of flavors of coffee and this one is my favorite ! great taste , not bitter at all a great flavored coffee for people who do n't really like the taste of coffee . 
the aroma is awesome ! ! love the flavor , really gets you going in the morning prompt delivery , this is definatly my husbands favorite single cup coffee . 
after 5 years with the keurig , this is the best if you like a medium blend , it perfect its smooth , and has taste not watered down on either setting . 
i am not a huge morning coffee person as this seems to be the only time of day black coffee upsets my stomach no idea why my work got a keurig recently and buy the caribou regular and morning blends , which are ok but i can hardly drink them unless there 's a creamer of some sort in them br br so on a recent trip to bb b i perused their wall of k cups and this one caught my eye i am generally a fan of flavored coffees and this sounded good , so i bought an 18 cup pack i have to say it is delicious ! the coconut flavor is light but definitely there , and does n't leave a bitter aftertaste like most black coffees do it smells so good my co workers have done a 180 walking by my desk to ask me what smells so good br br obviously if you 're a coffee connoisseur this wo n't be for you , but if not it is definitely worth a shot and the best part for me , aside from the flavor , no stomach upset ! . 
wolfgang puck makes the best coffee ! the package arrived on time and in perfect condition ! i would definitely order this again . 
have enjoyed every single cup of breakfast in bed just the right kind of brew to wake up these old bones and get me started on the day 's adventure also enjoy it while watching ncis so i can join gibbs enjoying a brew as well . 
i love this brand ! the best hazelnut flavor ever ! i wait for it to go on sale because it is more expensive than the other brands also , as another reviewer noted , it does say decaff on the bottom of the package ! it really should state that in the product description i 've noticed the packages from bed , bath and beyond did not state this but ca n't imagine both are available i 'll still purchase it because the flavor is so smooth . 
i 've long been a fan of flavored coffees so when we got our keurig brewer we jumped on the opportunity to sample as many different flavors of k cups as possible our first foray into the single serve hazelnut world was a href http www amazon com gp product b0029xdzki gloria jean 's coffees , hazelnut k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers \( pack of 50 \) a , which was absolutely awful we 've always enjoyed hazelnut coffee in the past , though , and vowed not to give up i ordered a sample pack of wolfgang puck 's hazelnut directly from keurig 's website and hoped for the best br br thankfully , hawaiian hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water it is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming the hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut , which you 'd think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted , but we 've been disappointed in the past i 'd never tried coffee from the wolfgang puck brand before , but our positive experience with hawaiian hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties br br the hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied , which is nice , but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found this suits me just fine since i enjoy a milder roast , but people who enjoy their coffee strong and dark might not enjoy this blend as much br br we 'll definitely be repurchasing this coffee when we run out . 
i love this coffee it 's one of my all time favorites it has the best flavor and i like the light roast br br excellent ! ! ! ! . 
i love sumatra coffee and was excited to receive these k cups however was disappointed when i opened my amazon box and found that the plastic wrap holding the two boxes of k cups was full of grinds meaning that there was a possible blowout of a cup after carefully unwrapping the boxes and attempting to get as little coffee grinds everywhere as possible i opened the first box and all cups were fine , however the second box every kcup was covered in fine grinds and i had to clean each one and found that 3 of the cups were defective due to the top being stamped on at an angle and the grinds had spilled everywhere i now see other reviews stating they had defective cups as well however the taste of the coffee is good . 
truly not much needs to be said because it 's wolf and to wake up to his coffee here at the house is fantastic ! . 
i expected more flavor from w puck though this coffee does taste good , it did n't have caramel flavor as expected this is my opinion someone else may feel differently the price is okay , i would not discount this product at all it 's a good product try it , you may like it . 
i 've tried all vanilla coffee k cups and by far this is the best ! wolf gang puck vanilla francaise is a smooth vanilla experience that lasts way after the coffee is consumed try it you 'll love it ! . 
i am not a huge coconut fan , so i was n't excited about trying this , but with one sip it definitely won me over ! the flavor is perfect and is now one of the flavors in our regular rotation and it smells so good ! ! ! . 
this is my daughter 's favorite k cup product mild medium roast it is the next best thing to having wolfgang cooking breakfast for you in your kitchen . 
wow ! that 's what my husband said when he tasted wolfgang puck 's 'jamaica me crazy' coffee for my keurig he is not a fan of 'strong' coffees and he really liked this one we both do i highly recommend this one can you put it on the subscribe and save \? \? a href http www amazon com gp product b003vxl0v6 wolfgang puck coffee , jamaica me crazy , 24 count k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 2 \) a . 
i'm sure this flavor is n't for everyone , but if you enjoy your coffee on the sweeter and more flavorful side then you should enjoy this it is not what i would call a strong coffee by any means i would describe it as mild and flavorful . 
i just recently got a keurig coffee maker registered it online keurig sent me a coupon for buy 2 boxes , get 2 free awhile back , a local bagel shop had a coconut coffee that i fell in love with so , i decided to try this coffee out because it has coconut in it i brewed my first cup this morning it smelled very strong of coconut so of course i could n't wait to try it after it cooled down a bit i took my first sip amazing ! ! it is quite delightful i strongly recommend it if you like coconut coffee no bitter aftertaste , either no soot the bottom of my cup awesome . 
i was really impressed with this coffee , it has a nice bold taste , yet a smooth br finish i would order this coffee again . 
when i coulnd't find island coconut k cups anywhere , i found this and decided to try it although it is not exact , it is so close it puts a smile on face the coconut is not over powering , but you can taste the hint of it certainly i love this and would order again and again because this is available and island coconut is not ! ! . 
this is my absolute favorite coffee flavor out there ! i'm so glad it comes in k cups ! and i'm glad it is so inexpensive ! . 
i find this particular brand as good as the local coffee shop coffee \( d d \) which is a compliment to the maker i have made this particular brand my 1 choice . 
i have at least 4 dozen different k cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors my favorite is timothy 's rainforest espresso because i like a bold coffee but others that prefer something milder say that breakfast in bed is their favorite i like it to but only when made as a stronger brew i have purchased maybe 15 boxes of this since it came out . 
i normally drink only donut shop , but when i saw this on sale i thought i would give it a try i was quite impressed with it and really enjoy this one i have now added it to my list of favorite k cups to buy . 
i really like the flavor of this one ! it has a low acidity but still full of flavor ! now i have to have it every morning and i am having trouble finding another one i like this much . 
i'm actually suprised from reading some of the rants about this coffee i have tried 20 k cup varieties and this is by far my favorite contrary to some reviews , i do n't find it to be weak at all and in fact , is quite bold but with absolutely not hints of being bitter very smooth and leaves a great aftertaste i prefer really strong coffee and this is a good compromise for a medium roast as it 's not as bold as i would normally prefer but certainly strong enough to satisfy my preferences br br i typically drink wolfgang 's jamaica me crazy but ever since trying rodeo drive , i have n't gone back . 
i am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when i bought the sampler pack of jamaica me crazy i honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee the aroma that it gives off while brewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere the flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all a great new addition to my coffee line up . 
this is the best tasting coffee available on k cups ! ! ! ! the flavor is amazing , it is more expensive than other brands , but for a reason definitely worth trying . 
this is one of the best coffees i have ever had for my keurig it is a nice smooth coffee and the price is the best price i could find i will be buying more . 
my husband and i are obsessed with this coffee we take kcups and hide them around the house because we wanna make sure it lasts a long time ! such a bold and delicious flavor ! . 
i had tried this coffee before , it is wonderful smooth and rich , full flavored , but not too bold i would recommend it to anyone . 
it was a bit of a risk to order this , i mean what are you going to do with 2 boxes of kcups that taste terrible \? but this was delish , the flavor was really good , and it was still awesome after it had cooled down it has a coconutty , vanilla flavor , very nice ! ! . 
i like the jamaica me crazy better , but when it 's out of stock , this is my second choice br br it 's got a nice flavor strength , without being bitter . 
taste is a personal thing , is n't it so i 'll just tell you \( as a gauge \) my all time favorite k cup is timothy 's midnight magic a california roast \( which is dark \) i'm partial to dark roasts and probably would not have even bothered with this sorrento , but a friend had it , so i tried it , and lo and behold i'm very glad i did i find this blend even better than puck 's kopei ray which is his dark roast there 's a whole lot of good flavor here the word luscious comes to mind this one 's not available every where and comes at a slight cost premium i say it 's worth it these will be a regular for me ps a suggestion \( which seems apparent \) as with any k cup , when you try a new blend , use the plain old 1 cup setting to check it out undiluted the first time . 
this is my favorite kcup i 'd describe it as medium dark , creamy and rich and very consistent a lot of k cups seem acidic to me , so i'm really glad i found this one . 
very delicious coffee , thankfully amazon sells this flavor now i have been waiting for it since i tasted this last year i like the fact that you sell it in a 2 pack rather than a single . 
delicious coffee , good medium blend its hard to find something that isnt too weak or too bold with k cups , but this flavor was perfect will buy again . 
good flavor coconut flavor is subtle and not overpowering in comparison , there is another coconut coffee by green mountain in which the coconut flavor is overdone in my opinion . 
to me , this has a good , balanced flavor some flavored k cups seem too light on hazelnut , or too light on coffee this one is just right . 
this k cup actually smelled up the office and it tastes as good as it smells i found it to be very flavorful . 
i was surprised to find out the coffee from my sampler had coconut in it i bought a sampler of k cups to try different flavors and would sit aside the ones that i liked to order in the future br br after drinking jamaica me crazy not realizing the ingredients just knowing i liked it when ordering , reading through the reviews realized it had coconut in it and that was what made the taste so yummy , leaving me wanting more i was hesitant to buy but decided to go for it and am really glad i did everyone i have shared my coffee surprise with loves it too . 
light and flavorful definitely describes this k cup i often find it hard to find flavored k cups that are n't either 1 \) so strong you lose the flavor or 2 \) so light you 'd be better off drinking water however , i have to admit i have found a new favorite in the hawaiian hazelnut ! . 
i loved this coffee i just got my order a few days ago and i normally drink just one cup of coffee in the morning now i ca n't wait and have had an afternoon cup , too i must say i look forward to getting up in the morning just because i know i'm having this coffee ! ! taht says a lot for a lte sleeper ! ! try this one ! ! i like it on thenext to highest setting on my keurig it has an awesome aroma while brewing and the taste is smooth , never bitter and there is something that 'hints' of a slight fruitiness with the first sips then the end of the sip is just a perfect brew , too never any aftertaste or bitterness i am so happy to have found this ! ! thanks wolfgang ! i have now all of your kitchen gadgets cookware and now the coffee too ! . 
best k cup around a must try ! amazon ships quickly and in one piece i 'd recommend the coffee as well as going through amazon to order this coffee from thank you for a great experience . 
usually do not get the breakfast blends but it was on sale and decided at price would try it out it was not as weak as some breakfast blends tend to be not bad . 
wolfgang puck definitely has the best coffee for the money i absolutely love the french vanilla the kcup actually makes a good full cup of coffee it could be a tad stronger but overall it is really good i still prefer the senseo pods to the kcups though . 
jamaica me crazy has a slight overtone of cinnamon that is a very nice compliment to the taste of coffee the flavoring is strong enough to taste , not just smell , without overpowering the flavor of the coffee very good . 
i drink my coffee with a splash of half and half other hazelnut k cups are too bland for me i much prefer wolfgang puck 's excellent rich roast with definite but not overpowering hazelnut flavor . 
definately not what i 'd expected with the wolfgang puck name on it to me , wolfgang puck has conotations of a heavy , dark roast european style coffee i thought i 'd already found my perfect coffee in a href http www amazon com gp product b001d0gv68 timothy 's world coffee , breakfast blend for keurig brewers , 24 count k cups \( pack of 2 \) a but this one edges it out smooth and balanced it really is great from the first sip till the last drop br br there will never be a coffee that all coffee lovers will agree on but if you like a light medium roast , give the breakfast in bed blend a try very low in acidity , someone who ca n't tolerate the acidity in coffee may be able to enjoy this blend but , be aware and contrary to popular belief , light roast coffee is typically higher in caffine than the dark roast coffees , the extended roasting to produce a dark roast burns away some of the caffine this one will definately get you going in the morning in a good way br br those who prefer a dark roast or extra bold should probably look elsewhere . 
this coffee says medium roast but is actually a little stronger we loved it and it has become our favorite if you want some coffee to caffeine you up , this is the one for you ! ! also , wolfgang puck 's breakfast in bed is great not so strong ! . 
i ca n't remember when i 've had a cup of coffee so delicious , i immediately wanted another cup there is no bitter taste , no funny chemical taste you get with so many flavored coffees , no odd aftertaste it 's just a mellow , gorgeous , hazelnut with a touch of the islands cup of coffee outstanding my favorite i 've ever tried , and i 've tried most ! . 
this is very good coffee , but it does n't have as much flavor as the van houttes creme caramel if your looking for something that has a lot of flavor , go with the other if you are looking for something that is more coffee than flavor , this is it . 
by far , this is the best flavored k cup coffee i 've ever had good body , not bitter , no flowery aroma \( like with the green mountain flavored k cups \) i like my coffee a little stronger than puck 's hawaiian hazelnut , but it is certainly a fine , medium bodied , coffee i could drink over and over . 
these k cups are wonderful ! we were pleasantly surprised with the low acidity and smooth flavor ! the rodeo drive k cups are on our top five k cup list ! . 
while looking for a top rated vanilla k cup , i stumbled upon this combination flavored cup that was rated higher than any of the vanilla flavored cups at that time i took a chance and ordered a double pack from amazon and was pleasantly surprised this is a rich tasting medium light roasted flavor that appeals to several coffee drinkers at our house there is a hint of built in sweetness so that additional sweeteners are not necessary for those of us who do n't care for super sweet coffee i would classify this as a medium roast and tastes best with the medium sized cup selections on our keurig coffee brewer a href http www amazon com gp product b000gtr2f6 keurig b 70 b70 platinum single cup home brewing system a people who prefer extra bold coffees would need to use two of these k cups to make one extra large travel mug of coffee br that said , we have found that mixing this flavor with other flavors to make an extra large serving is a most enjoyable pastime at our house the most popular combo 's so far are jamaica me crazy with a href http www amazon com gp product b00395dvqs van houtte french vanilla k cups for keurig brewers , 24 count boxes \( pack of 2 \) a , hazlenut a href http www amazon com gp product b00395574m van houtte hazelnut decaffeinated k cups for keurig brewers , 24 count boxes \( pack of 2 \) a or costa rican a href http www amazon com gp product b001hkzz4i van houtte caf eacute , costa rica tarrazu \( light roast \) , 24 count k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 2 \) a in the end , this is one of the most versatile flavors for those of us who have frequent visitors and several palettes to please . 
bought this during one of amazon 's friday sales did not find too many reviews since these are fairly new took a chance and am very pleased we like our coffee rich and strong and this one delivers great tasting dark roast coffee ! . 
this coffee is surprisingly delicious we never had a problem with the k cups bursting maybe it is a defect on the coffee brewer \? this coffee is a bit less strong than we normally prefer our coffee but it makes up with great taste look forward to my mug every morning would definitely recommend it and will buy it again . 
exact same as the ones bought at the store only a lot cheaper recommended for any keurig drinkers out there . 
this is my 1 favorite coffee blending of hazelnut and coconut are perfect thank you ! ! br br question why was i charged postage on this brand when i have never paid on any other brand of k cups from amazon . 
if you like your keurig you need to try this k cup smooth taste with just a slight hint of flavor not overwhelming like some brands my new favorite . 
this is our favorite k cup coffee , it is strong and taste great \( although it seems that many of the k cups \) have nearly the same overall taste . 
this is a good tasting k cup from a guy who drinks coffee black and prefers a bold , full flavored taste i would recommend . 
i love using k cups ! although i have tried so many bad coffees i have finally hit on one dark roast coffee that is n't bitter and has a wonderful flavor you do n't have to try them all , this is a perfect blend coffee . 
ok so this is the best flavored coffee ever no after taste that seems to always occur w flavored coffees its not even really flavored , it has hint of coconut taste but it really still tastes like coffee just the best coffee ever mmmmmm add honey yummy ! ! ! ! ! br highly recommend ! . 
wolfgang puck k cups are under the radar their coffees are smooth and delicious and jamaica me crazy is my fav and the best coconut flavored coffee on the market island coconut is quite poor in comparison . 
i 've always hated the peete 's or starbucks burnt bitter taste this is a great blend , still strong without the burn roasting br br fyi , low quality beans are burned to hide it 's bad taste . 
i like the darker roast coffees and this fits the bill this is every bit as good as deidrich and tulley 's but typically costs more i guess wolkgang wants a cut if you catch it on sale , buy it . 
it was as good , if not better , than i was told ! great taste ! i will puchase it again . 
this is an excellent full bodied coffee without a bitter taste in general the wolfgang puck coffees are quite good although a little more expensive than some of the other k cups . 
as always , i love this coffee , it 's about the only kind i buy for myself the turn around time is terrific when i have about a week 's worth of cups left , i order and have the next batch in perfect timing very happy with everything about this product . 
this coffee is a smooth , yet robust taste that does not have any bad after br taste a href http www amazon com gp product b003vxjj28 wolfgang puck coffee , rodeo drive blend \( medium roast \) , 24 count k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 2 \) a . 
i have tried many brands of medium roast coffees however , this is my favorite some i 've tried are bitter some are too light some are too strong but this one for me is just right ! some brands more than others come in all puffed up and when punctured , the grounds filter out into the needle of the keurig coffee maker and has to be cleaned which is n't difficult , just annoying never had a problem with these breakfast in bed k cups are smooth , not too light and not too strong , right smack in the midddle no bitter after taste either and perfect any time of day enjoy ! . 
sometimes we have a problem ordering the k cups because they are way too strong for us even if you order medium blend this coffee was great just right ! it was a smooth blend , and was perfect for a morning cup of coffee or anytime ! would definitely order again ! . 
good description of this product has the over roasted popular coffee flavor , but , not overpowering one of my favorites so far . 
i ordered this by accident and i'm so happy i did this is a new favorite of mine it 's nice and strong without being bitter . 
note this one is better for me at the smallest cup setting , which makes it stronger br br this is my first time to try wolfgang puck coffee i have mixed feelings about it so far the rodeo drive blend is a little more 'bland' than i'm used to , which is great for people who prefer that it 's just a different taste , which is good or not so good , depending on each person 's preference personally , ever so often i take a sip of rodeo drive blend and think that it almost tasted like dishwater then that goes away and i enjoy the rest of the cup of coffee i think that reaction is because it is n't as strong and bold as i'm used to , but it 's pretty good i can see that some people might make this their favorite because it is different br br will i buy this again \? no it 's good , but it 's not my preference , and i might as well buy the ones that make me rave on and on about how good they are , usually tully 's french , kona , italian , and house those may be too strong for some people , and the rodeo drive blend does have its own unique taste which may really appeal to some coffee drinkers as with most things , actually a little more than in most things , with coffee , it 's a matter of taste and probably a matter of what you are in the habit of drinking you may want to try this one , especially if you can find it in a sample packet , or do like i do , keep the rest for guests to try . 
my friend says she loves this coffee and has never been able to find it in the local stores where we live aha , she did not know that amazon sells just about anything you could want no tax and free shipping what could be better . 
hazelnut being the household favorite favorite , i thought i 'd give these k cups a try the flavor is smooth and delightful i suggest trying this brand for your k cup machine ! . 
this is good , but could be a bit stronger in the hazelnut flavor it is good though and i would purchase it again . 
i love jamaica me crazy coffee this version is flavorful , the price is pretty good , and it sure beats the office pot coffee that sits on a burner for hours fresh coffee , fast ! . 
this coffee has become one of my daily favorites it 's not quite as strong as many of the french roasts , but it 's also not as bitter a good way to start the day . 
this is my favorite so far amongst the wolfgang puck k cups the word that comes to mind when i sip it is bright it has a natural sweetness and good flavor , without being overly heavy the packaging lists it as a medium roast , but i 'd put it more towards the light end of the spectrum it 's a very enjoyable cup , and i 'd recommend if you are looking for something to switch up with green mountian 's popular vermont country blend or breakfast blend br br i generally have n't been impressed with the wolfgang puck flavored varieties \( vanilla francaie , jamaica me crazy \) , but this regular cup is quite good . 
i have had all of the various keurigs since they came on the market for home use thus , i have tried pretty near all of the various k cups this is one of my top 5 favorites love the coconut in it , and the wonderful coffee flavor yum ! ! ! ! . 
this coffee was not what i expected but enjoyed it greatly i was looking for a stronger vanilla flavor but after trying it i enjoyed it a lot it was light and smooth and left no aftertaste i would recommend this to others . 
i like columbian coffee and this is above average with a good dark color with a nice smell the taste is bolder than average but not unpleasant or bitter this is my strong columbian coffee combining all the good things of the type with a bolder taste . 
smooth i normally drink dark roasts but purchased this on a lightning deal \( or maybe a friday sale \) i like it . 
i 've tried every bold k cup and this is one is one of my favorites very nice flavor and strength . 
we have a keurig coffee maker one of the side benefits is the opportunity to experiment with different k cups i have already tried half a score some seem pretty tasty at first until one taste something that is even better some early k cups that i graded highly do n't compare too well with later brands that i have tried br br wolfgang puck 's columbian dark roast noir is one of the better products that i have tried it has a bold taste , although not strongly so it is also smooth tasting br br it is now on my short list of possibilities for my first morning cup of coffee so , i am pretty happy with wolfgang puck 's product here . 
this is my favorite coffee flavor and i have not had it in a long time forgot how delicious it was until we ordered the k cups love them , already ordered more . 
we 've only been using the k cups about 2 months both my wife and i like our coffee bold i 've been guided by amazon reviews and started out with coffee people 's jet fuel although that is still my favorite , i got this french roast on a friday sale and would say that it 's my new second choice i have also tried coffee people 's black tiger \( a close third \) and kona \( not a fan \) this is a nice , well rounded every day cup , more on the bold side but not wincingly so . 
i bought this coffee for my keurig coffee maker and i really like it smooth and the best thing it is an organic wolfgang uses the the best beans for his coffee 's buy you will be pleasantly surprised . 
great tasting coffee strong , but not obnoxiously strong and no nasty aftertaste too bad , it cannot be purchased on subscribe and save anymore . 
this is the best all around 1st cup in the morning coffee ever ! i love it perfect flavor . 
by far the tastiest coffee i have purchased from amazon sorry it is n't in the shop and save any longer delicious ! ! ! . 
love this blend , so was delighted to find it on your subscribe save program \( at a better price br than w keurig so really disappointed to learn today it was no longer available on said program br shame on manufacturerer ! . 
i have tried about 25 different k cup flavors , and this is my favorite it has a wonderful aroma , and just the right amount of hazelnut use the subscribe option , and this is a deal that ca n't be beat . 
i buy these with subscribe and save i like the flavor and aroma going on month two and i am not tired of them yet ! . 
i was very excited when i received a keurig coffee maker as a christmas present , could n't wait to put it to use however , in the three months since i 've had it , i have struggled to find what i think is a good cup of coffee most of the brands i 've tried have either been too weak or too strong br br i am not a starbucks kind of coffee drinker , or fan of fancy flavored coffees i just like a regular cup of coffee that smells good when it 's brewing , tastes smooth when i drink it finally , just like goldilocks said , this one is just right . 
one of the weaker flavored coffees but a yummy one almost no need for milk as it is already creamy tasting . 
this coffee is awesome kinda bold , with a sweetness excellent my son says with international 's carmel macchiado creamer you can find in the dairy section . 
the coffee was great spent some time in jamaica and got to love the coffee nice to get in back home as well . 
i got this with the purchase of 24 different bold coffee k cups to find the ones i like best , and so far this is my favorite it may not be bold enough for some , but it is not supposed to compete with the 'extra bold' varieties this was smooth and not nearly as bitter as many bold coffees so many bold blends have a 'burned' flavor , leaving a bad taste in your mouth , this one was strong without the bad aftertaste , perfect for me ! . 
i like full bodied coffee and to try something different to supplement the standard one i use this coffee was perfect for that purpose timothy 's rainforest expresso is still my standard one but i will order this again . 
creme caramel is by far my newest favorite ! great coffee flavor , not too weak , with a wonderful caramel aroma ! . 
i drink alot of coffee and love hazelnut coffee , this brand has the best flavor i have ever tasted i have bought several different brands and this one is the best ! it may be a few dollars more but it is worth it i absolutely love and enjoy it every morning . 
my favorite , i have it auto shipped through amazon the only problem i have is i drink way too much coffee now because i like it so much . 
this is one of my favorite k cups it 's a rich dark coffee without the bitterness of some highly recommended . 
this is my favorite of the flavored coffees i am not usually a fan of coconut but this coffee is deliciously coconutty chocolaty ! love it ! . 
yummy , mild , and delicious my new favorite ! mild in comparision to coffees called rocket fuel and taste like motor oil , but truly a medium roast pleasant in the morning makes you glad to have a good cup of coffee . 
wolfgang puck coffees are great and the creme caramel is one of my favorites i would recommend this coffee for people who like a mild flavor . 
i thought that because of the name attached that i would be wow ed its just a good average coffee nothing spectacular . 
i prefer mild to medium coffee and i 've tried so many different k cups but i 'll stay with this one the other reviews were right on , smooth and not any bitterness just a great cup of joe with amazon prime it came super fast , if you 're not a prime member i strongly recommend it . 
i am having a blast with my new keurig machine trying out a bunch of new flavors including the dark roast it 's nice and flavorful particularly since i run each of my cups through the small cup brewing cycle 2 times to fill my large mug this works br tried the chocolate donut flavor the other day and loved it br love the convenience and bargain prices of the subscribe save . 
i am impressed with mr puck 's different blends , this one is a favorite of ours it lives up to the medium roast name , full bodied , not acidic and smells great while brewing , will buy again . 
great deal great turnaround ! what a difference from other orders i have placed with other vendors ! got the package the day after i ordered it ! . 
if you like vanilla flavored coffee , this is it ! ! i put a french vanilla creamer in and no other sweetner is needed i have it every day and i 'll always order ahead so i do n't run out . 
this coffee is bold and none of the bitterness that is usually found in bold coffee 's it also scored exeptional in the single serve coffee ratings and i concur there is a lot of dreck out there in k cups , this and wolfgang puck 's hawaiian hazelnut are great ! . 
very smooth and flavorful for a medium roast i was pleasantly surprised by this k cup and would get it again the 25 off deal drew me to it and i'm glad . 
this is my favorite of all the coffees i 've tried smooth and flavorful without being a flavored coffee , its a definite treat anytime of day . 
this is about the strongest k cup i 've purchased i like my coffee strong , and before buying a k cup coffee maker , always purchased french roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee brewing this in a k cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee since i brew a cup for my wife and i at the same time , i run two 8 ounce cups with one of these k cups into a small decanter , and then pour into two coffee cups , which still yields a strong flavor , but not enough pop your eyeballs out br br of course , brewing two cups with one k cup drops the price down in half , which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of k cup brewing i find most k cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup , and 16 ounces would weaken them too much but this works for my wife and i since i have been fixing a cup for each of us for years , and brewing two cups with one k cup is economical . 
i want this coffee in bed every morning , just like it 's name breakfast in bed i ordered this 24 2 box shipment on the automatic 2 months plan i used it up way before the next shipment so i changed the plan to every month now is looks like it 's out of stock ugh i hope it comes back soon it is a delicious choice ! . 
this product takes getting used to only after using about 3 k cups did i start liking it however , i would n't buy this many again . 
i'm loving this coffee ! ! it 's smooth and bold but not too bold it reminds me of starbucks coffee but not as bitter very very very good cup of coffee give it a try i'm really glad i did . 
until i tried vienna coffee house , donut shop was the one i had on automatic monthly delivery vienna coffee house is a tad bolder than donut shop but very smooth without any bitterness from the first cup , i knew i had to switch . 
of all the k cups i have purchased so far , i like this french roast the best it has a really bold taste even used with the large cup button i like other coffee selections too , but this one really stands out br br i consider myself an early adapter and the keurig coffee machine is one of my best purchases although the coffee is somewhat expensive at 40 50 a cup , there is no waste , no pot cleanup , and , best of all , great coffee i usually get up earlier than the rest of the household and can have my great coffee almost instantly without making a full pot that can go sour before all being drank br br i notice that regular retailers such as target and grocery stores are now carrying k cups , but buying online costs less and is more convenient pjs . 
i do n't drink a lot of flavored k cups , but people have been raving about wolfgang puck 's k cups , so i gave this a try it 's definitely a good quality flavored coffee with a medium body overall , i have enjoyed several cups of this and have temporarily shelved my timothy flavored k cups in favor of this one i sometimes add sugar free vanilla syrup , cream , and cinnamon it 's excellent that was in place of dessert i also tried caramel syrup added to this do n't do it it overwhelms the flavor . 
i love coffee with no bitterness and lots of good coffee taste and this one fits the bill holds up well to milk sugar i love it in the morning for the first cup and in the evening just as much definitely would buy it again . 
i love , love , love , this coffee it 's easy on my stomach yet it has a rich medium roasted flavor which , in my opinion is not bland at all it 's such a delicious cup of coffee i have told everyone about these , i 've even converted green mountain lovers over to wolfgang puck rodeo drive brand if you like your coffee fully flavorful and delicious , but not too robust or bold , this coffee is for you i have tried many k cup brands , tully 's , green mountain , emeril 's , donut shop , etc and this brand is equal to green mountain , possibly even a bit better \) . 
this is a fantastic decaf coffee my parents love decaf but there are n't many out there they enjoy we 've been drinking timothy 's decaf colombian and we bought this to try it fantastic ! i would definitely buy this again and again it 's smooth and not bitter it 's not super strong so do n't expect it to be like a cappacino this is a really great colombian cup of coffee you wo n't miss the caffiene . 
i like my coffe of the milder but tasteful side i thought this was a great cup of coffe i compare it to timothy 's dounut shoppe full flavor but not acid this is for people who want a lighter cup of coffee . 
jamican me crazy is the best coffee it is not too strong and has a unique taste no complaints here highly recommend it . 
this not only tastes great but has the best aroma while brewing subscribe and save is the way to go . 
trying out different pods and this is a delicious one service was excellent no hassle at all will buy from again . 
i was n't sure what to expect with the wolfgang puck coffees , but i am pleased br br the sorrento is a good medium roast it is a bit darker of a roast than some of the other mediums out in keurig land , but it is n't bitter there 's just a little of something chocolatey in the flavor br br my only complaint is that this coffee , like most of the keurig cups that do n't say extra bold on them , they brew up pretty weak if you do a larger mug i typically brew the 9 25 oz size , and on these guys i bumped it down to the 7 25 oz size if i brew it in the larger cups , it just comes out too weak br br if you are one who feels that k cups usually make weak coffee , you will think that these are really weak , and be tempted to brew 'em two at a time this coffee is not plain or unflavorvful there 's just less coffee in the k cup \( or rather the normal , not extra bold amount \) , so it brews up weaker . 
i like this coffee , its nice to drink it in the morning it has medium body and full flavour goes great with raw sugar and splash of non fat milk . 
i'm a sucker for caramel anything love the flavor , the aroma , and most important the taste i honestly do not like flavored coffees in the morning , but i have made an exception for this one ! . 
i am trying many different coffees to see which one 's i like best this coffee was good , but a little stronger than i had expected i know it say 's extra bold , but others i 've tried have not been that extra i ended up putting it on my larger cup setting and it was perfect then there was a little after taste , but not much more than other coffees i would recommend it if you like stronger coffees , but it is not as strong as an espresso i intend to purchase this again . 
i like a dark rich coffee and this is a tad different it seems much smoother and br i tend to nearly crave it when i have a slightly acid stomach it sounds odd and br i know i drink too much coffee but this fills that acid tummy niche . 
tried this for the first time this week and it is now my favorite coffee with a hint of flavor \( coconut \) full bodied , and no after taste , jamaica me crazy is just what i love for an afternoon pick me up , or to wake up and have an immediate smile on my face seriously it 's awesome ! highly recommended . 
wolfgang 's reserve columbian decaf is probably the best decaf we have had in a k cup very good cup of coffee ! . 
this is a coffee that i look forward to drinking as soon as i wake up ! very nice . 
light vanilla favor not overpowering nice coffee , the first box that was purchased was too light on the vanilla flavor and aroma surprisingly the 2nd box was much better one of my new favorites . 
we love our keurig coffeemaker and have tried many coffees recently discovered wolfgang puck 's new line of coffees and are pleased with all of his we have tried this one is smooth with a great flavor , no bite we would purchase this again . 
this is a mild but delicious coffe some might say a dessert coffee i really liked it as a pleasant change from full bodied flavors . 
was looking for a strong k cup that could hold up for the perfect espresso and for a great cup of coffee ! now receiving on auto ship , if you 're looking for a great bold k cup , this is it . 
i read several great reviews on this coffee on another site and decided to give it a try it 's now one of my favorites and i will be ordering it again the taste is great , sweet but bold enough that i can do a large size and it still have flavor . 
great coffee has a nice bold taste for a medium roast coffee this is my new favorite give it a whirl . 
i bought a two pack at the friday sale for 20 reasonable , but not an amazing deal i 've been pleasantly surprised by the taste i do like the van whatever flavor french vanilla k cups , and this contains significantly milder flavoring of a good tasting coffee br i would and have served it to company and highly recommend serving with milk or cream br br if you like flavored coffees , you 'll most likely enjoy this one if you like it plain and black , you 'll probably hate this . 
nice medium coffee blend that has a hint of vanilla and a touch of sweetness if you like a href http www amazon com gp product b001hwi700 emeril 's vanilla bean bam ! , medium roast coffee for keurig brewers , 24 count k cups \( pack of 2 \) a or a href http www amazon com gp product b001chj03i gloria jean 's coffees , cappuccino for keurig brewers , 24 count k cups \( pack of 2 \) a , you should like this blend br br i drink this as an afternoon or dessert coffee with a splash of milk and a sugar packet br br 4 stars because i would like just a touch more vanilla flavor br br 1 21 11 we ordered another box of this coffee and the vanilla flavor seemed to be a little stronger than our first box . 
i found the taste and strength of this coffee just right for it to gain the honor of one of my go to coffees for my keurig not too strong or bitter , i rather enjoy the flavor sadly with the recent k cup coup staged by green mountain coffees , it looks like amazon is n't carrying the wolfgang puck coffees any longer and my subscribe and save \( and my business \) will need to go elsewhere definitely give this coffee a shot if you can . 
love this coffee ! the aroma is as delicious as the flavor my husband would typically have a cup of coffee once or twice a month , now he 's having a cup several times a week . 
it is a medium roast pleasant coffee , comparable to green mountain 's breakfast blend i bought it with a very good deal though . 
simply awesome i love bold coffee and love french roast brews this is a truly wonderful fr blend dittos for deidrich fr , both are awesome br br i also tend to like the bold coffee people kcups most all i 've tried have been bold and flavorful , each with it 's own distinct flavor . 
i got the coffee for 12 50 per box ordered 4 boxes ! ! such a great deal , as the coffee is a great blend br br if anyone is upset because of the website having issues when they were trying to buy it , they should n't review the product poorly , as it is not the product that is the problem br br the problem is that you 're jealous you did n't get such a great deal on the coffee grow up kids , this coffee is great ! ! ! will buy from amazon com , llc again for more k cups for my keurig br br all of my coffee arrived packaged well and in new condition , nothing wrong with it ! ! . 
highly recommended for those who appreciate a good dark roast coffee , wolfgang 's sumatra kopi raya excites the flavor buds and ignites one 's morning always a good start to any day . 
definitely not extra bold medium roast at best not particularly memorable does n't have a good coffee aroma but it 's pretty decent tasting at this point i'm not sure if i would reorder . 
i'm not a coffee snob if i was , i doubt i 'd own a keurig i just want a decent tasting cup of coffee with little cleanup br br i 've tried many of the flavored coffees , but they 're too gimmicky for me starbucks brand tastes burnt to me , even their blonde roast in stores i mean , i have not tried the starbucks brand kcups br br i like this breakfast blend because it 's not too dark , not too light it tastes like what no frills coffee should taste like i order the biggest size to get the best value br br update i just tried to create a review for the jamaica me crazy coconut flavor , which i thought was terrible \( and i love coconut \) i should specify that the original review was for breakfast in bed . 
i do like this coffee , but even with subscribe and save , amazon 's price is higher than k cups at bed bath beyond convenience is one thing , but since there are bb bs all around me , it 's pretty easy to pick up my coffee there and save a few bucks i wish amazon would price their coffees more competitively i 'd buy here exclusively if they did but this is good , medium roast coffee not quite as strong as i 'd like , but a little stronger than the breakfast in bed version i may need to try sorrento and see if it 's a little bolder . 
my favorite k cup so far absolutely no aftertaste , which in my book is a huge plus it 's not acidic , not bitter , just a great mild cup of coffee , which is exactly what it purports to be ! i wish other people would read the description before they give a bad review based on their own stupidity do n't buy a medium roast coffee and complain because it 's not bold ! also , as a general rule the ones with breakfast in the name are milder i do n't care for bold , dark roast , slap you awake coffee so i would n't buy a bold coffee and then complain that it was bold . 
i 've read so many reviews on the many brands and varieties of k cups coffee preferences are so subjective i did like the flavor of this coffee bold but not bitter as to strength i wish that there was more coffee in each k cup i am accustomed to starbuck 's strength , and i have to set my keurig to medium cup size to get the strength i need this is not as cost effective as say jet fuel \( but i found jet fuel too bitter \) br if wolfgang puck would add more coffee to its k cups , this would be a perfect coffee for me . 
this coffee has a very tropical taste to it , so it 's perfect for iced coffee on a hot day the flavor is not bad when heated , but it just seems a little odd br br you do n't usually think of tropical beverages being hot . 
we have been enjoying our order of w puck sumatra kopi raya dark roast coffee k cups for the last week we find the delicious flavor very satisfying not so strong to be bitter , and not so weak as to taste like colored water the coffee is perfect there is just the right amount of heartiness to make it an enjoyable coffee experience , and it carries a nice lingering pleasant flavor and aroma it is not as strong as an espresso , but maybe one step below like we said , pleasant , smooth , and flavorful ! . 
i am not a fan of any of the decaf k cups i have tried but this one is probably the best i like strong coffee and his comes pretty close to what i would expect although it says medium roast . 
i was intrigued how this particular blend got such an exotic name , and i was n't disappointed there is an ever so slight coconut aftertaste that makes this so delicious , i do n't like strong coffee , and this is perfect for my husband and i i get it send regularly now and it 's one of our favorites ! second only to jamaica me crazy by wolfgang puck wolfgang is much tastier than the other brands . 
i tried this coffee on a half dozen quests this weekend and they all loved it for those that like their coffee mild , i brewed 7 oz cups for those of us that like it bold , i brewed 5 oz cups br br as an earlier posted noted , it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees the taste is n't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee regular and black but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention br br i plan on trying all of wolfgang 's line wish he 'd offer a variety pack . 
i just got my box today and brewed a cup after work it 's one of my favorite k cups yet ! ! i recommend it smooth , does n't taste watered down , and no bitter aftertaste the cups also look pretty in my k cup rack \) . 
wolfgang puck 's hawaiian hazelnut is the best k cup hazelnut and i have tried them all we ordered this large pack , because we sadly found out that wolfgang puck is discontinuing many \( not all \) of their k cups , including this flavor buy this while you can ! . 
so far , of all the decaf kcups we have tried , this is our favorite wish it were on the automatic ordering system coffee is such an individual like or dislike but when we use it with an 8oz cup of water it is great . 
i bought the kuerig because i love the dunkin original and green mountain nantucket blend rodeo drive has now become my favorite it is very delicious and smooth . 
when i feel that i do not need more caffine , i have found that the wolfgang puck decaf is a great substitute i really ca n't tell the difference , taste wise i had been having trouble finding a good decaf i think this one is it . 
sometimes i feel when i reach for a decaffeinated k cup that i'm going to settle for less flavor however , i'm completely happy with this product i do n't feel i'm missing anything everyday i treat myself to a relaxing cup of coffee after work before starting dinner this product just fits what i'm looking for . 
i got a 5 k cup sample box of this coffee from keureg , and i find that it is my favorite decaf coffee it brews a smooth tasting cup of coffee every time i add some 1 2 1 2 and a bit of equal , and it is a treat any time br glad to have found this coffee . 
wolfgang puck coffees are very good this particular flavor of decaf is delicious does n't taste like decaf at all , very rich flavorful also , this was a very good value for the price i 've recommended this product to several friends . 
my wife and i have decided hands down , this is our favorite k cup we 've tried a lot of others , and donut shop and caribu daybreak are certainly still up there however , this has a very solid body flavor with a medium roast almost a bold flavor with a smooth finish excellent flavor versus strength really nice to get up on a lazy sunday morning and have a nice cup of breakfast in bed ! br br also , i see another reviewer had problems with messy k cups i can say after about 6 boxes of theses , i have n't had any issues very unfortunate for the other reviewer , but looks like it was rather isolated br br give it a try , you 'll certainly enjoy it , the wife and i sure do ! . 
i am usually a non flavored coffee drinker , but i do like to mix things up every now and again this is a lightly coconut flavored coffee the coffee itself is a medium brew and it goes well with the tropical undertones of the coconut it is a nice summer drink . 
i love quite a few coffees but this one is grabbing my whole households attention it 's not bitter but it 's not light either it 's perfect i love it . 
i switched to decaf and was looking for a decent cup on the keurig machine i was only interested in subscribe and save options br br this is a fairly light roast , which i like i brew on the middle setting and i think if it was brewed any larger i would think it was too light . 
absolutely love wolfgang puck rodeo drive k cups it is the best nice rich flavor but not too strong best one yet ! . 
i have purchase this coffee several times my husband said it has a great taste and it is a good cup of coffee . 
i am a huge fan of jamaica me crazy coffee there was a time in my life when i was totally caffeine free and off the dark stuff , but a customer in the bank i worked at brought in a pound of this coffee as a gift to the tellers every time someone walked by my desk with a cup of this freshly made joe , the smell would really tempt me to go back to consuming coffee again eventually it broke me down , and i am back to being a full time coffee drinker , and proud of it ! imagine how happy i was to find my favorite brew in a k cup ! the only thing better than a cup of jamica me crazy is a cup sweetened with the new almond joy flavor international creamer in it to highlight the sweet coconut unfortunately , we only have a keurig at our office \( i'm in real estate now \) , so i have to go to work to enjoy a cup i'm thinking i have a brilliant boss who knows how to get people to willingly show up to work ! now if i can just figure a way to use it to temp more buyers into our office i 'd have it made 0 \) . 
i bought this grudgingly because my favorite timothy 's italian blend was out of stock and i was very happily surprised ! it 's not as big and winey a brew as my favorite , but was flavorful , had a delicious aroma and was smooth i tend to like rather potent coffee but i have clients who prefer a little lighter cup this will be perfect ! i will happily keep buying this coffee thanks wolfgang ! . 
i think this is a love it or hate it kind of coffee i love it the flavor starts out similar to butter toffee , but then sort of morphs into coconut , pineapple , and rum i think it 's delicious and unique , and i do n't ever want to be without some in my cupboard . 
this one will not disappoint ! i got this yesterday and my husband and i tried it this morning with breakfast and we both loved it i have gotten many different kinds of the k cups to try but after trying this one , i think i could be happy with just this one and black tiger for those mornings when i want a really strong cup of coffee the rodeo drive blend is delicious with a nice round feel on the palate and an interesting flavor on the finish with just a hint of smokiness perfectly balanced and absolutely wonderful ! plus , i have to admit i love the label the different color looks very appealing on my carousel with the other k cups . 
we 've tried many of the k cups that are available , and this is in our top 3 we prefer a darker , bolder flavor , and this one hits the mark at the same time it 's quite smooth . 
my husband i both like a mild tasting coffee we thought we would give wolfgang puck breakfast in bed a try we were pleasantly surprised by the full bodied taste but without the bitterness of some of the stronger tasting coffee 's we are very satisfied and will be drinking this for a long time ! now if i can only get my husband to take the name literally ! . 
this k cup is one of my favorites along with coffee people 's jet fuel and black tiger if you like a strong , rich coffee , this will fit the bill . 
not too strong , not too weak smooth without the bitterness great anytime for those not into the strong grow hair on your chest types we will continue to purchase this as a part of our favorite brands . 
wolfgang 's rodeo drive does make a good ole cup of coffee it is on the same line as donut shop very good morning coffee to wake up with . 
i have tried several decaf k cubs and have found this to be the best my husband does not like decaf but has finally found this one he will drink because it has a little bolder taste i find it a good coffee to have in the house for company because everyone seems to like it i will be ordering it again and again ! . 
this coffee is for those who like a strong robust flavor nothing wimpy about it i like just enough cocoa mix and creamer to take off the edge my husband goes for the gusto great wake me up in the morning brew love it ! . 
this is an excellent blend perfect for any time was really surprised by the quality , flavor and finish . 
nice , smooth cup of joe high recommend not sure why there is not more reviews \? ! \? ! . 
this coffee was in a sample selection when we ordered our keurig brewer it was by far our favorite ! i have ordered this coffee several times from amazon it is a dark roast , but not too strong . 
you get a consistent cup of coffee with a hint of hazelnut a cup of hot coffee in about 20 seconds that tastes great what 's not to like about that \? ! \) . 
these have a stronger caramel flavor although still a medium strength coffee the best caramel flavored k cup i 've tried ! i will reorder them . 
i want to try other types of coffee but i am so stuck on this one that it 's hard to try anything else ! this is a mild roast medium or dark roast is too strong for me these days the hazelnut flavor it very nice and every cup brewed is superb i have been drinking this wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut for at least 6 months and it never fails to please give it a try \) . 
love this rodeo drive it has a very drinkable taste is also good and it is smooth ! i recomend that you try this one . 
this is the most delicious coffee ever it does not mess up your stomach it 's amazing and tastes wonderful and everyone at work loves it too . 
for years , i 've been completely devoted to dunkin donuts brewed at the store and at home i tried brewing dd in my k cup and i also bought the eco brew and the actual dd k cups awful ! so i was searching high and low for a new coffee after trying all the decaf k cups on the market , i finally found and loved wolfgang puck decaf coffee k cups this is the only place i can find them so i hope amazon never stops selling them here they are mellow , medium roast and i enjoy them every day any other brand is just a back up try them i have never had any trouble with any of the cups and i'm on my third order now of 48 cups if they had a problem , they 've fixed it br br this is an update being done on july 7 , 2012 i continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee every day it has ruined me for other coffees as i measure every other cup against this incredible wolfgang puck decaf k cup please , please , please amazon , make this part of your subscription service my head hurts trying to make sure that i always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee . 
great product to start your am with as its not too strong but just the right tast for your morning wake us up . 
our keurig coffee maker was a great christmas gift last year one of the pleasures of this device is the experimentation with various coffee blends some have worked well others have not some are too mild some are a bit off on taste br br this wolfgang puck product is one of the more successful experiments with the keurig machine it has a rich taste and still remains smooth not too strong a flavor , but it does have flavor br br so , the two coffee drinkers in my household are quite pleased to drink this brew . 
i roast my own colombian beans at home so i have a perfect 10 for reference right off the bat let me say that just like their sumatran reserve , this k cup is not bitter , but smooth the aftertaste is also smooth my chief complaint is it does not taste like a colombian bean it really is missing the deep flavor of a columbian coffee , while the sumatran puck k cup definitely has a sumatran taste the 8 oclock brand you see in many grocery stores has a more distinct flavor than this k cup that being said , my final recommendation is that i would recoommend the puck sumatran over this if you like a distinct coffee flavor however , if you are looking for a not too stong but not bitter coffee , this colombian is a great choice i would buy this again just because of the smooth taste . 
i 've always been drawn to k cup varieties with out there names \( jet fuel , black tiger \) and distinctive flavors \( golden french toast , spicy mayan chocolate \) this offering melds those two features into something i'm happy to wake up to ! br br to me , jamaica me crazy 's definitely got a pervasive coconut taste fairly similar to dunkin' donuts coconut flavored coffee , but it 's also got a lot of the flavor characteristics i 've come to expect from k cup chocolate brews barely any of that acidic aftertaste that 's almost inevitable with artificial flavors , and definitely not as watery as many other k cup varieties sure , the name 's pretty corny and the taste is hardly subtle or sophisticated , but that 's what makes this cup of joe so fun ! . 
my pomeranian loves these treats he eats one every morning ! they do smell a little , but that is probably why he loves to eat them i 've ordered these many times and never had a problem with them being opened when they arrive . 
my girl has loved these for two years when the local retail outlet , trader joes , no longer carried them we found the manufacturer this is one of the few treats wilhi girl enjoys . 
i purchased this cassoulet for my wife 's birthday dinner i never tried this brand of cassoulet before it was delicious the sausage was excellent the duck was good the general flavor was superb . 
excellent quality pet food with no inert ingredients , filler or potentially unhealthy meat by products i used to have to travel several zip codes away to buy it , and it was well worth the trip to give them food i was confident was of the highest quality my cats ca n't get enough of it and the price is very competitive , especially if you are a prime member br br still in doubt \? try this test br br open a can of your current cat food and smell it then compare that to any flavor of merrick it wo n't turn your stomach br br when it says fish , there are huge chunks of you guessed it fish not a weird extruded looking grey or stinky brown paste that you could mistake for what comes out the other end , but actual food in a can speaking of which , the post meal 'litter box stink' period is dramatically reduced as well , as is fecal volume less to clean \) br br give it a try remember to mix it with your old food for a day to two to ease the transition , but your cats will thank you for it . 
my cats are more enthusiastic about turducken than just about any other cat food they literally lick the plate clean even my laperm , who usually just gives me silent meows , manages to squeak out an audible meow when i start putting this on a plate the ingredients are much higher quality than many brands , too \( no by products , corn , etc \) i will be ordering more . 
coffee pods used to be sold in safeway and target etc stores in my area in the last year the pods have not been stocked in favor of the new single brewer style k cup while i can locate many sources on the internet i have found that quickest delivery at a reasonable price is buying senseo from amazon br mostly a french vanilla drinker i find the taste is consistant , the packages keep fresh for months , \( i typically buy 72 pods per order \) the pods work very well in my bunn 35400 0003 coffee maker tea brewer single serve pourover i wish every item i purchased was as easy reliable and quick as these coffee pods . 
i purchased these pods using amazon 's subscribe and save program for the first time this year the order was received promptly and the pods were fresh and very flavorful i have used this flavor coffee pods since january 2007 and have not been disappointed ever hopefully i will be able to continue receiving them from amazon . 
have a senseo coffee maker given to me a few years ago for more than a year , could not find pods sold any more in local supermarkets even at the big w just happened to come across them at amazon went on auto ship every few months for additional savings i have always liked the french vanilla so no problem there still like fresh brewed better but if you want a quick cup of coffee , these are perfect i'm just happy that i did not jettison the coffee maker will next look for the sumatra pods , my other favorite . 
i enjoy flavored coffees french vanilla is a favorite i only wish senseo would offer more flavor varieties it would also be nice if a variety of flavored coffees could be sold as a pack of 6 \( example 3 hazelnut and 3 french vanilla or 2 of 3 different varieties \) these pods are easy to use and cheaper than area store prices it 's more convenient to purchase online not all stores carry pods for senseo coffee makers . 
i just love the french vanilla coffee ! it is gives my day a great start ! easy to use , one cup at a time , with no waste ! . 
i love senseo paris ! it 's easy , fast and great tasting , with never that chemical aftertaste of so many of the french vanilla coffees amazon is the only place i can find it consistently so i have it on the subscription plan ! thanks amazon and senseo ! . 
just read the reviews that said it had a chemical taste i totally disagree i think it tastes wonderful ! i guess its all a matter of personal preference i love it so much , i cant go back to the regular unflavored coffee the only thing that 's too bad is that it 's artificially flavored i care not because of the taste , but because artificial flavors are probably not too good for me but i love the taste anyway ! senseo could easily use natural vanilla flavoring , it is probably more expensive , but they should do it anyway to give their customers a better product unfortunately too many companies today use non natural ingredients in the quest for larger profits , which is a sad commentary senseo , you need to start using natural vanilla flavor instead of artificial for the health of your customers br br but i still love the taste and cant drink any other coffee ! the senseo coffee in general is so wonderful i 've gone through two machines already the frothiness of senseo coffee is so delightful its like cappacino froth only better i use silk vanilla creamer too which gives it an even better taste \( their product does have the natural vanilla flavor so maybe that is helping with the taste \) then i always top off my coffee with cinnamon sprinkles which makes it even more wonderful ! br br all in all , a great coffee and coffee system , just please start using natural flavor senseo , for the health of your customers ! you would probably have even more customers if you did \) . 
senseo paris french is one of my favorite senseo coffee 's always a great cup of coffee great price from amazon ! . 
it 's so easy to order our favorite coffee from amazon we love the taste of the coffee and ease in brewing it . 
we go through a lot of this flavor love the senseo machine and their customer service love the ability to use different flavors of coffee and tea everyone can have their favorite in seconds we just use a lot of the french vanilla . 
good taste , a little on the weak side especially since i mix it with half soy milk after it 's brewed delicious nonetheless . 
best coffee in the world i'm so glad i found it here because other stores had stopped carrying flavors only regular . 
this is the third senseo brand coffe pod i have tried and it is my absolute favorite i have tried vanilla flavored coffees from several major gourmet coffee dealers and to me this coffee has the best vanilla taste of them all it is great to use in a single serve type brew system or in a small 4 5 cup brewer which is what i use the pod makes cleaning the brew basket a breeze and yet there is sufficient amount of grounds to give a good strength to the brew i do n't like my coffee as strong as some , so if i want more coffee i leave the pod in and simply run a quick second brew cycle if you like your coffee normal strength you would likely use a new pod for each cup brewed also , this coffee is available in a subscribe and ship option , which is a wonderful way of assuring yourself of plenty of coffee at hand when you want it just choose the frequency of shipment and leave it to amazon ! . 
great coffee we mix it with godiva chocolate coffee or regular medium roast what a treat . 
the senseo pod coffee maker is my favorite appliance and paris french vanilla caramel bistro coffee pods are simply the perfect blend of richness and flavor the taste is n't overwhelming or subtle , but just right this is the perfect way to start your day ! . 
senseo pods are getting harder to find , especially the paris , vanilla caramel flavor i am happy to find these on amazon at a very good price , especially at the subscription price . 
my wife has one of the one cup coffee makers i used to make fun of her for the one cup thing but you know sometimes i only want one cup too ! the senseo pods have good flavor i 'd rate them a 5 star but if you use only one pod the coffee is a little bit weak for my taste in the stores i have to pay over 5 when i can find the french vanilla buying them on amazon in the pack of 6 was much cheaper , especially with the automatic re order discount . 
phew ! am i glad i found these senseo paris french vanilla caramel bistro coffee pods ! all of my local stores either do not carry them anymore or are charging over 5 for one 16 count bag the 6 bag pack should easily cover the 3 month subscription time frame as i only use one pod a day the other great thing is that the package 's expiration date is many months in the future so i know they are fresh ! i highly recommend subscribing to the automatic re order system thank you amazon com ! . 
senseo is my favorite coffee maker of all the coffee pods i 've tried from senseo and other brands , i keep coming back to paris it is consistently a delight i 've had trouble finding it in the market because of popularity and now , flavored pods are becoming scarce no problem i have my subscription to back me up and make it easy br br i love coffee , and i do not drink a lot of it so i want something that is a delight , and i want to be able to have a supply available so when i run out , i do n't have to go on a hunting expedition to get it this plan is perfect for that need you can skip a shipment if need be , or increase your order it is flexible , more cost effect than the stores , and reliable in availability br br what more could you want \? . 
so far this has been a great way to order my favorite coffee it has become really hard to find it at the local stores but amazon had it even cheaper than i previously paid for it it arrived very quickly and i am waiting any day now for the next shipment . 
the paris bistro is my 2nd favorite flavor for senseo it 's a nice , mild flavor that does well for a late afternoon pickemup i 've enjoyed senseo in europe for years on my visits there and waited till finally , it was available here i get my regular douwe egberts coffee at a local european deli , only one in the dallas ft worth metroplex that carries it \( henks \) i think americans expect stronger flavors in their coffee than the europeans this is mildly flavored , just the right touch . 
i have tried other brands of french vanilla coffee and this is the best highly recommend it . 
nice flavor and great aroma while brewing everyone is always jealous when i brew it at work . 
if the house catches fire , i will grab my husband , amnimals and senseo i love the french vanilla coffee pods i use one pod and select the 2 cup option as i dont like strong coffee you will instantly fall in love with the foam that is on top of the coffee use fat free carb free vanilla creamer and you have a mighty tasty cup of coffee ! ! ! ! . 
how many ways can you say yum ! \? it 's a delicious way to wake up in the morning or to enjoy any time of the day . 
i love the coffee pods and i love the fact that amazon sells them in bulk thanks . 
this is honestly the best coffee and the best deal anywhere check out the local store prices on this wonderful coffee and you will know why amazon and senseo are so great together ! . 
this is really the way to go add some creamer to further enhance the flavor of this blend i signed up for a subscription to have this delivered every month i drink some every morning at work works great with the b d home cafe system . 
the coffee i ordered is great if you want a sweet coffee this is for you . 
we got our senseo coffee maker through a promotion i had always wanted to try it out i purchased a variety of coffee pods and my husband and i tried them out we have yet to be disappointed we love it so much , we have told several people about the senseo and they have gotten them as well this is a wonderful product and we waste a lot less coffee using the pods instead of making a pot of coffee in fact , i think we drink a lot more coffee we want to try all the varieties of the senseo coffee pods pair the pods with the barista blend flavor packs , sit back and enjoy . 
the pods arrived fresh and quickly after ordering them by ordering the coffee through the subcription program they are a good value the flavor is good , slightly bitter after taste to this brand of coffee . 
overall , this makes a great fast cup of coffee , especially if you are just going to add a flavored creamer or sweetener to it anyway i use two pods to make an 8oz cup of coffee and i am pleased overall with the strength . 
i'm not a coffee snob , barely drinking a cup a week , but my significant other needs a strong mugful every morning the pods and the senseo machine are perfect for this barely takes 2 minutes to brew the 6 pack box comes out to about 30cents a cup even with the added latte packets \( 60cents when two are used for a strong mug serving \) wonderful aroma and works well with the flavor packets i'm hoping the money saved by avoiding starbucks every morning will go to my potato chip addiction . 
this is my first purchase of senseo coffee pods the package coming with the coffee machine is unflavored , so i went online to buy this french vanilla from amazon price was surely attractive with this bulk purchase however , i am not totally satisfied with the flavor , comparing this with what i got from other coffee vendors \( e g the cafeteria in my office building \) this french vanilla from senseo is good , but is n't strong enough anyway , i am satisfied with this combination of price and quality and i will try a different flavor next time . 
this is a great coffee with excellent flavor you can add an extra pod for a darker , more robust coffee the aroma fills the air as your cup is being filled . 
i 've been a huge fan of the senseo coffee machine ever since i experienced one in france upon returning home , i found one and have never looked back the paris french vanilla is my favorite , and i often receive comments from others that it smells like pancakes after i 've brewed a cup great stuff ! . 
it is a good coffee flavor i get it every 3 months it is great to not have to think about getting the coffee it just comes to the door . 
as usual the coffee for the senseo coffee maker is outstanding the french vanilla has the flavor i prefer over the others . 
i love these coffee pods ! if you 're into heavy cream , heavy sugar , heavy coco foam in your coffee , you may not care smells wonderful , tastes even better with the senso coffee maker you can have a cup of this great tasting coffee in about 1 min if you 're into the above mentioned fu fu additives any coffee will do br after this item being unavailable for a very long time , i assumed they had stopped making it i was overjoyed to receive a notice from amazon com that it was again available , so i immediately placed my order i was dissappointed to learn that i wo n't be receiving my order for a month oh well it 's the very best , so if i must wait a month i will . 
excellent tasting will have to remember to order some more later br br yummo ! ! ! . 
i love this coffee and it is so convenient to have it shipped to me automatically ! . 
good but folgers version is significantly better tastewise and so far amazon does n't carry it good price though , and i like the free shipping which i'm not certain will last having a huge supply of these on hand makes it 's hard to make coffee any other way though ! ! this is just sooo easy ! . 
so long as you have a pod type coffee machine , the senseo pods , in all their variations , make a good cup of coffee easily if you drink one or two cups of coffee per day they are worth the price of the machine and the pods . 
this stuff is terrific ! it 's been at least 20 years since i have seen damson plum , jelly or jam , in stores in my area the taste of amish made damson plum jam was just as i remember it has a smooth texture and is sweet without being too sweet i will order this brand again . 
if you have not tried this combination you really should totally awesome flavor mix great on roast pork or to just dip pretzels in or put it over cream cheese and use crackers br would buy again great service and got here sooner than expected . 
this is the second time i have ordered from them , and again , the service was wonderful ! i was impressed with how well everything was packaged , and also with how quickly i received my order i 'll be ordering again from them ! thank you ! . 
i've been buying olvatine for 16 yrs for my 7 children to drink i buy the malt flavor and now they don't sell in any of my grocery stores that i shop at in chicago where can i buy it . 
we love ovaltine ! we buy all of the flavors ! we cannot find ovaltine in the malt flavor , anywhere ! can you help us \? . 
if you go to the rumford web site , you will see this br br in 1859 , eben norton horsford \( 1818 1893 \) , a co founder of the rumford company , formulated and patented rumford baking powder , the first calcium phosphate baking powder rumford baking powder quickly became widely accepted since it achieved more dependable results and was less expensive than using crude formulas of cream of tartar and baking soda the calcium acid phosphate in rumford baking powder was also considered to be healthier than cream of tartar br br i had really disliked baking with regular baking powder since it was soapy and bitter tasting this powder has no such problems and it works great also , it has no aluminum in it , unlike most commercial baking powders i discovered that many chefs and professional bakers use it , so i was happy to find a superior alternative to the regular , common baking powders on the market . 
i could n't find rumford 's at the grocery , just found brands with aluminum , but of course amazon has it ! i have used this brand since i started cooking as a child at my parents' house . 
i learned to use rumford from my mother she could always taste the baking powder if another one was used therefore , we never had calumet in the house . 
i love this product ! but the downside is that i was overcharged when i saw that the cost of this product was 10 00 i assumed that it meant 10 00 for a case when i received only one can , i was stunned to say the least a few days ago i happened upon this product at a grocery store the 8 1 oz was 1 29 i am hereby requesting my change back ! ! ! ! ! ! rumford is one of the best baking powders presently on the market ! ! ! i like the fact that it 's aluminum free hence , i will be purchasing this product from the grocery store . 
excellent customer service i sent them an inquiry via email and they responded quickly , via email and followed up with a phone call as well item received faster than expected ! i love ordering from paella com ! . 
i have two cats , one who eats wet food as a last resort \( mostly she licks up the gravy \) , and one who has food allergies \( grains \) and is incredibly picky \( wo n't eat any grain free cat treats i 've found so far greenies , the tasty junk food ones , wellness cat jerky bits , shaved salmon , etc does n't like catnip , and turns his nose up at anything that costs less than 1 29 a can it seems , to include spots stew authority organix most flavors of avo derm , holistic select , and innova max cat and natural choice \) br br she still licks up the gravy , and eats about half her bowl he eats his portion and finishes hers , with no vomiting or retching \( so nice ! \) he also wakes me up in the morning if it 's breakfast time and i have n't gotten the memo yet , and looks at me like i just kicked his grandma cat when i 've run out br br this has quite a bit of juice in it , which is good since most cats do n't drink enough water anyway br br as for me , i love this food b c it does n't smell to high heaven , and i have n't died from litterbox duty as of yet \) \( get it \? duty dooty \? hehe \) . 
this food looks just like something you would make for your pet at a thanksgiving day dinner ! i was impressed with it when i opened the can , and my cats were when they ate it it contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey not too big , making it easy for my kitties to eat they have gotten the tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when i would try to break them up not this , i just spooned it into their bowls and they took over from there there is liquid around the sides of the food in the center , but the meat vege mix in the middle is well packed i did n't feel like i was getting more liquid than food , like halo foods so i was happy about that as well plus , through amazon , this is a great price for this quality food . 
if you 're new to this product you need to be very careful of dosage it is strong some batches are stronger than others . 
good flavor , unique in all the teas that i 've tried br br this tea is effective for cleansing one 's system , but is not as harsh as a regular laxative it can be consumed daily or as needed . 
i 've used this brand for years if you 're feeling clogged up or ate a massive meal have a few sips of this tea if you 're new to it make sure you 're home because it can work a little too well if you know what i mean just be careful the first couple of times using it and try little sips you 'll see a result by morning or earlier if you follow it with lots of water . 
i always have this in my house i drink it as is or my favorite is mix with sprite oh so good ! ! i have some every day i do not mind the larger bottles as i use so much of it bring it on ! . 
i love this green tea it is a good price for my use with my tassimo machine . 
my husband has acid reflex and this is the only hot drink that the doctor has recommend that he can drink thank you amazon for carrying this product . 
i got this for my mom and she loved it she just got a tea maker and with this 3 pack of 8 discs each , she is going to have a lot of tea i should n't have gotton the awake tea for her because it was only 1 package with 7 discs because it is more expensive oh well , the thought that counts ! btw if you read this , please check out my seller profile and items i sell i will star to sell stuff soon and once i talk with amazon i will let everyone choose super saver shipping i am a true seller and give the customers what they wa n't in perfect condition anyways , this tea is great and i reccomend this to everyone who loves tea . 
i really enjoyed this green tea , and i ca n't wait to try making it as a green tea latte i love my tassimo machine \) . 
this is the quickest way to make a darn good cup of green tea ! i was skeptical about having a cup of tea that was n't brewed , but this is very close ! . 
for the last year , our tassimo machine has made only tea , as all the coffees are greatly lacking instead we buy imported german coffees which are the best in the world br br we use 3 teas 1 , the best is twinings earl grey br 2 , next best is twinings green tea br 3 , next best is tazmo awake black tea br br these teas are all great if you can get some good natural north dakota honey to put in them , you will like them even more . 
in my opinion the best soda cracker on the planet , if you like or love crackers diamond bakery makes the tastiest cracker . 
i have tried them all from the top name brands to the baked cheese crisps that seem to have become the craze these days these cheese puffs simply take the cake ! not only do the pack all the flavor and texture one would want , but they are packed with the vitamins and proteins one needs ! imagine that a guilty treat like a cheese doodle is now a healthy alternative ! . 
this reminded me how much i enjoy indian pickle it was basically good pickle br problems br it seemed a bit stale br it was fairly pricey br but it did remind me that i really like indian pickle , and told me that i could get it on the internet , so i poked around a bit and found a place \( ishopindia com \) in another suburb of chicago which was closer \( skokie i live in oak park \) so instead of it coming from texas , it came from skokie \( less than an hour 's drive away \) that solved the staleness problem their prices seemed to be about 2 3 of amazon 's prices i thank amazon for reminding me that i should look . 
patak 's chilli pickle br this is a seriously good pickle from patak 's , with lots of salty heat and endless chunky chilli pieces i bought it to dip popadoms in , but finished the pot as an accompaniment to slow cooked pork sausages , and it worked beautifully certainly as well as a full bodied english mustard br br if you like a bit of heat , as well as plenty of flavour , you 'll enjoy it . 
my mother in law simply loves these candies she is on her fourth tub since christmas she prefers them over the sunkist fruit gems i hope they remain a stocked item . 
soft and slightly chewy candy is optimal \( not gummy \) to me and these are that the flavors are good but not great they are heavily coated with sugar to sweeten them up as they are not sweet without the sugar coating i will purchase them again . 
i had a recipe that called for a lot of dark chili powder and the only place i could find it was amazon com i bought a jar of this and it made two batches of the chili recipe i have the chili was the best i 'd ever made i can vouch that this chili powder really does make a big difference in the flavor of a chili it is rich with a bit of a kick everyone has been crazy for it , and i think its due to this chili powder i'm back to buy the bag this time ! . 
more iron than turmeric but this is a very nutty tasty spice that i mix with all other spices this is one of the main ingredients in most indian curry powders bravo . 
without a doubt , this is hands down the best coconut water product i 've tried the others i 've experienced have a flat or slightly bitter taste but this one has that subtle essence and sweetness of coconut water drank directly from a freshly opened raw coconut let me tell you , this is the most refreshing , hydrating , and re energizing elixir you can partake of i 'll take this over gatorade any day of the week great way to start off any day . 
best coco water plz bring back br i 've been drinking it for the last 3 4 years and this one only 1 liter pack is really the best br unfortunatley , the manf seems to have discontinued it what a shame ! br the small size product is not at all good only this one br hope this company gets some common sense and continues this product which was so good br br one large 5 stars br one small 2 stars br one kids 1 star br zico upsets stomach 2 stars br vitacoco tastes awful 1 star br bluemonkey 3 stars br amybrian 4 stars br c2o 2 stars br naked 2 stars br nirvana 2 stars . 
we drink this coconut water every day in our house it 's become somewhat of an obsession we used to have a subscription to the 12 pack of vitacoco and when that ran out we tried this instead i like it better it tastes cleaner though i ca n't describe what 's different about it , i just feel better after drinking this than drinking the vitacoco coconut water in general has an odd taste to it but it 's still really sweet and feels so refreshing when you drink it if i'm really hungry i drink this between meals and it 's kind of like a protein shake or energy drink it settles my stomach and gives me a fantastic burst of energy ! . 
i make coconut water a part of my daily regimen , whether i 've exercised or not it gives my body a much better and healthier boost than caffeine , and gives me an overall feeling of well being i recommend this to everyone , the only downside is one could go broke drinking a liter box every day like i 've been doing . 
as i ordered a 12 pack of o n e coconut water , i remember thinking twelve \? what on earth am i going to do with 12 of them \? an easy way to get potassium was what i was looking for , but when i took my first sip i was hooked ! not only is this loaded with the potassium i needed for my nightly leg cramps , it has a mild , pleasant flavor talk about refreshing i ca n't wait for summer now ! there is an instant cooling sensation , a pleasant , smooth mouth feel , and a thirst quenching ability you wish a soda had i 've tried other brands , but they come across as raw or harsh for me o n e is the v s o p of coconut waters \( to me , that means the best \) my shipment arrived earlier than expected and was in perfect shape if you want electrolytes in a delicious , healthy form , this is your stuff as far as my hesitancy on ordering a twelve pack there 'll be an order for another twelve pack arriving soon ! . 
i come from that part of asian subcontinent named after the coconut tree coconut trees are in abundance and we use every part of the tree imaginable when we want a refreshing drink we just pluck a tender coconut off the tree what i wanted to tell u is that i am a difficult nut to crack when it comes to coconut water and i love the one . 
i make coconut water kefir with o n e 100 coconut water i 've tried using zico brand i do not like to discredit any brand , but for some reason my coconut water kefir goes bad much too quickly when using zico \( sometimes within 1 2 days should last 7 days \) i do not presume to know why the taste of zico is not as good as o n e maybe they overheat process it \? o n e 's package says it is gently pasteurized br br if you 'd like more information on why coconut water kefir is so great for you go to \( no , i am not connected with body ecology \) br br if you 'd like to learn how to make coconut water kefir go to br br there 's also milk \( cow 's and goat 's \) kefir that are extremely good for you kefirs are used all over the world for health and nutrition just not common in america go figure . 
if you love coconut water this kind is the must have i am on auto ship and it arrives on time and packaged to perfection to prevent damage . 
we love coconut water some brands are really icky zola sold at von 's safeway is really awful sweet and sickening , made from concentrate br br o n e is a very good tasting product though zico is always my first choice , but has a history of being 'out of stock' so it is often a case of purchasing o n e 'cause zico is unavailable o n e ships well , i 've never had one arrive leaking \( as i have often with zico \) . 
coconut water and its many benefits are nothing short of phenomenal and i personally was so excited to have an opportunity to purchase in bulk br br what isnt phenomenal is that every single box in my 2 shipments must have experienced some temperature changes , or , they were discounted because br of a faulty snap closure at any rate , almost every single carton either came with the lid broken off \( adhesive gave out \) or it eventually breaks off br not such a big deal , unless i want to take a carton with me . 
i was buying this product and others like it in the 11 5 boxes but it saves a lot of money to purchase it in the 1 liter packages the taste is great and the product was very fresh with a good shelf life since i have a prime account , i received package in just 2 days and with free shipping great deal if you like coconut water like i do . 
i 've tried several brands and this is true to the taste of fresh coconut water , though slightly more dilute the wholesale price here does n't make much sense to me it 's about 5 75 per liter in an 12 pack i get it for 4 99 at publix the only disadvantage is that they only have maybe 4 or 5 at a time , but i'm one of few buying it and i sweep the shelves of it \( lol \) br i'm 37 weeks pregnant and this helps decrease the swelling in my legs and keeps me well hydrated i do n't experience any leg cramps like i did during my first pregnancy i think the potassium makes a huge difference and with a tendency towards gestational diabetes , the low sugar content vs other sports drinks is a huge advantage they should market this directly to pregnant women with diabetes \( with no renal issues \) . 
i love this product i wanted something healthy and good tasting that did n't have added sugar or chemical sweeteners as an alternate to water this is it i like this coconut water better than others i have tried it is n't as sweet as the amy brian brand , which i prefer i do not use sugar so i found this brand to be the best the taste has also been consistent since starting my use of this in april i have purchased four cases since june 2012 it also has a lot of health benefits . 
best coconut water i 've tasted and i 've tried plenty of other brands ! it 's a must buy if you like coconut water ! . 
this was not bad at all i had a bad experience with vitacoco acai and pomegranate and it was horrible ! ! ! it had that strong coconut flavor that i do not like i had already bought this so i was nervous to try it i was surprised when it barely tasted like coconut it does n't have that typical strong coconut taste i usually stay away from anything coconut candy , food , beverages , etc for some reason it gets me sick but i wanted to try this , because i heard coconut water is good for you i already tried the mango , pineapple , and pink guava flavors they are delicious pink guava is my favorite o n e brand is my favorite as long as i do n't really taste that strong coconut flavor , then i will keep drinking this . 
this is the best coconut water ! ! ! ! ! ca n't get enough \) it has such a smooth and pleasing taste ! vita coco is another wonderful product ! . 
if you drink coconut water , this is the best commercial one no doubt consistently good and if you decide to subscribe that is even a better deal ! . 
i get these for 4 34 at my local health food store their price sucks ! it is one of the best tasting coconut waters around though ! . 
this is a new package of o n e coconut water the taste is completely different from previous packages it tastes like real coconut water from a coconut tree . 
i have tried three brands of coconut water and this is my favorite it is sweet , but naturally so unfortunately the price is a bit high for me if it becomes available as a subscription and or the price lowers , i will switch back to it i tried zico and found it to be a bit sour and bitter for my taste i am using roland cans now it is not as healthy as it has sugar and water added , but i love the coconut bits and the taste is good and the price is right . 
for everybody 's information , o n e coconut water is made in the philippines not brazil as claimed it was only a brazilian who developed the business but the coconuts came from the philippines a href http www amazon com gp product b000ll0r8i vita coco 100 pure coconut water , 11 1 ounce containers \( pack of 12 \) a . 
due to a failure in the packing of this item , it was returned before even getting here i strongly recommend that the packing department does a better job , because i ordered it again and this time one of the boxes was damaged apart from all that , the product is great . 
as another reviewer noted when you heat this product in the microwave , you must keep an eye on it it tips it pops and eventually spills all over however , if you keep an eye on this product , stirring it every 20 30 seconds of the 2 3 minute heating period , you can avoid the spilling and tipping , ect also the noodles do puddle at the bottom once you complete the soup but i usually keep a spoon nearby so i can at least finish the soup and not waste it simple fact of gravity i guess but even stiring frequently ca n't seem to prevent this from occurring br br despite these problems , i give this product 5 stars i do this because it is more a convenience than a nuisance with lower sodium than the regular type of soup \( this product is still 730mg of sodium , 30 of the recommended daily value \) and an easy to go container make it a good to go snack comparing the price per each on amazon vs a local store finds it much cheaper here on amazon i recommend this product but ask you head my suggestions to avoid the problems that appear to affect others too . 
these are good and low calorie i keep them in my office for when i want a light lunch i do n't noticed that they are low sodium , but i do n't eat a lot of sodium anyway , so it may taste different to someone else . 
it is too bad that i ca n't find this product locally any longer it was a favorite in our household now my source is amazon and i'm just as happy with that as i was before it has a great flavor that is long lasting . 
after trying different citrusy flavors of gum \( including orbit citrus mint , orbit sangria fresca , orbit fabulous frutini , extra fruit sensations island cooler , trident tropical twist , and stride always mandarin \) , i have concluded that stride forever fruit takes the crown br br there is a real burst of flavor \( and natural tasting sweetness \) as you pop a piece in your mouth , and although it does n't last forever , it definitely holds its own against each of the flavors mentioned above br br feel free to conduct your own taste test to find your own favorite , but i suggest you take my suggestion to try stride forever fruit who knows you may realize that you wo n't even want to try any others ! . 
arrived very speedy and the gum has an excellent flavor ! ! this is a gum chewer 's gum . 
this is a good gum to chew if you are looking to switch from sugared to sugarless gum it 's sweet , and does n't have a strong aspartame taste , for being sugar free it does n't last 'forever' like the commercials and 'forever fruit' name would lead you to believe , but the flavor lasts longer than a lot of sugarless gums , and it has a nice kick of flavor when you first bite in everyone in my family likes this flavor of stride br br do n't confuse this with the darker but similar colored packaging 'mandarin' flavor . 
like me , you can still enjoy the delicate beauty of bonsai carefully preserved , these are real bonsai preserved in suspended animation they need no feeding , pruning , watering or plant care , merely cosmetic care for those of us who do n't have the time , patience or skill to cultivate plants , these make a nice surrogate , and they make nice gifts , too preserved bonsai can reach into the hundreds of dollars this one is double trunked , reasonably priced , and very attractive . 
i ordered two the monterey double trunk preserved bonsai tree the artificial aralia bonsai tree br br both trees came packed so as to not move around in the box br they spray foam around the base and let it cure in the box it creates a very stable platform br the trees are absoulutely gorgeous ! ! ! ! br they look very close to the pics they show here br since they are hand made , each will look slightly different , but nothing that detracts from their overall beauty br by the way , bonsai boy does not manufacture these br they are jobbed out to artisans in other parts of the country , hence the wait of at least 14 days to get your item \( s br they are truly works of art and i 'd recomend these to anyone who has a love of these trees , but like me , does not have a green thumb br the communicaton with bonsai boy is good and they endevor to answer any question you have br did i mention how beautiful these are \? lol ! . 
we have purchased two trees and both were gifts the first tree was thoroughly packaged with some type of foam insulation totally surrounding the tree impressive excellent condition ! the second tree came with no insulation but with a cord attaching the tree to the bottom of the box a couple of small limbs were broken off it is much better packaging with the foam insulation br br the gift was assumed by the recipiant to be artificial \( fake \) , which in this case was not a good thing the gift tree was actually preserved it would create a much better packaging if the tree came with a certificate stating the type live , preserved or artificial br br love the trees ! they made excellent gifts . 
my wife and i ordered this product for her bosses birthday we received it quickly , but we did pay extra for the shipping , but we were in a hurry the product we received was in perfect condition and absolutely beautiful ! i hardly ever write reviews , but this one was worth the time i love bonsai trees and will definitely buy another one just like this for myself in the near future this is a product that can be admired for many years to come . 
been looking for a nice preserved bonsai for a friend who can kill grass and this seemed like a great solution shipping took a little longer than i expected , but i guess i am spoiled with prime packaging was interesting with the bowl 'cemented' into the box with spray foam definitely held the piece solidly , but i almost damaged it getting it loose be prepared to literally cut it out of its packaging a pain , but manageable br br the piece itself was fairly well done , definitely not as good as the one in the illustration , but still a nice piece i will probably do some light trimming to give it a little more character before presenting to my friend the bowl and stone are nicely matched and the tuft of moss is a nice touch . 
this makes for a great centerpiece on a dining room coffee table as well as a great conversation piece ! i have to convince friends that this is n't a real live bonsai tree when they see it it 's very convincing , which is to be expected considering that this is just a real tree that 's been preserved br br my tree does n't have the look of the picture , and the branches are much more bushy wild , but it still looks fantastic i could always trim it if i wanted to make it more sparse but i like it how it is the moss is a nice touch , and the pebbles look great and are glued in so they wo n't fall out br br overall , i'm very pleased with my purchase ! . 
i bought this fondant to use with young teen girls who had no experience with fondant we used gel colors to make several different colors , and the gel colors worked beautifully with this fondant we did n't need the expensive cake decorator colors to get gorgeous results the other thing i liked was this fondant was not hard to work with if you can work with playdoh , then you can work with this fondant and it tasted good , too ! i have tasted other fondants and it looks pretty , but you peel it off before you eat your cake with this fondant you will actually want to eat it as well as look at it this is a good choice for cooks who like their creations to look and taste good . 
i have worked with a couple different types of fondants , wilton , fonderific and satin ice i must say , sorry wilton but you have terrible fondant terrible ! anyway , fonderific is great , its soft , stays soft , tasty , easy to work with i always have a tub just incase i run out of my main fondant if your looking for a starter fondant fonderific is great ! enjoy cakers ! ! . 
i thought this fondant was very easy to work with and it tasted great ! also the wedding cake i used this product for turned out awesome and the bride and groom and their guest loved their cake ! . 
amazing fondant from fondarific so very convenient to get it through amazon ! easy to use , nice taste and would definitely recommend it for anyone with a passion for cake decorating . 
this fondant taste great and is easy to work with easy to roll out and takes very little kneading to make it pliable to work with . 
as always , fondarific is awesome ! covers cakes wonderfully and it 's so easy to use ! love it , and will continue to use it forever ! . 
this is extremely better than wilton ! ! ! buy this and never use that nasty stuff again this is actually edible , unlike products and is very easy to work with . 
i 've tried wilton 's fondant before , which tasted horrible and was n't that easy to work with fondarific fondant is amazing ! it takes color very nicely , i use wilton 's gel colors , and is very easy to work with it 's a little hard when you take it out of the container , but i just pop it in the microwave for 10seconds and it becomes soft enough for me to work with br this fondant tastes soooo good ! like cotton candy delicious ! ! br i made a 3 tier birthday cake using this stuff and i still have some fondant left over br my tiers were 10 , 8 and 6 the first two tiers were 4 tall and the 6 tier was 8 tall i also used this for decorations br everyone at the party loved it ! . 
i usually make my own fondant but decided to give this one a try it was an absolute pleasure working with fondarific wedding white since its cold here at the moment the fondant arrived stone hard so i had to break some apart with a knife and heat in the microwave for ten seconds after which it was great working with it im not a professorial and i have to say that this fondant was very easy to roll out and cover a two tiered cake . 
i purchased this fondant for a wedding cake that i was making i have tried numerous brands and even made my own fondant this fondarific fondant is easy to work with i am an amateur baker and will purchase this product again . 
i used this fondant to create dice to add to cupcakes for a bunko for the cure fundraiser they came out awesome and were a huge hit ! the fondant color was bright white and worked great with the wilton food markers \( for the dots on the dice \) this fondant is so incredibly easy to work with and it tasted delicious even the non fondant lovers in the crowd \( including me \) loved the taste ! i look forward to using this product again and again and again ! . 
my order was on time and packaged correctly bought this for my daughter who is a pastry chef and loves fondarific price is great for a 5lb tub . 
this was my first time using fondarific and fondant in general this one was really easy to use for a baby shower cake it worked just as indicated i also colored it and made a two tier cake \( baby blue and white \) the final product looked great not greasy . 
when i first heard of kopi luwak coffee i was horrified , but then the idea grew on me and i decided i really wanted to try it , so on my bucket list it went to purchase this same package directly from the producer is nearly twice the price there 's not really 16 servings per package , maybe half that it is pretty amazing coffee and i'm thrilled i tried it remember when shopping for kopi luak coffe make sure you 're getting 100 civit coffee and not a blend which can have as little at 1 or 2 kopi luwak coffee check out realkopiluwak com for info on how civit coffee is produced and how to brew the perfect cup . 
after doing a ton of research and reading about civet coffee i finally broke down and purchased this for my birthday , just to give it a shot at first , i was not impressed thinking that i just overpaid for some upgraded folgers but then i figured it out the secret to this coffee is making it in smaller batches at first i was making 4 5 cups at a time in my small coffee pot then i cut that back to a two cup using approx 3 tablespoons of freshly ground coffee it was amazing ! ! ! the depth and natural sweetness of this coffee were unbelievable definitely something worth trying at least once i for one will be looking forward to the next time i can justify purchasing this special occasion coffee . 
i thought that i should post a review in response to bad cat we ordered off the same batch for the same holiday reasons and had no illl effects the coffee was great there was no tart aftertaste no matter how strong you brew it the only reason that i gave it only four stars is that i would personally of liked a litter darker roast i just wanted to say that we drank off the same lot as bad cat , in the same year , christmas eve and christmas , with zero headaches or ill tidings it just might have been something else . 
if you want 100 kopi luwak , this is a good method to acquire some in a relatively cheap manner it 's not as good as some of the stuff i 've had , but it 's definitely in that special class that kopi luwak belongs in i 've served this for guest , given it as gifts , and enjoyed it on special occasions i 've made it in french press , drip , and in one special instance espresso ! br br to truly enjoy it , use about 8 grams of beans per 7 ounces of hot water used to brew this is the appropriate ratios serve black , no cream or sugar as this will ruin your treat this bean is n't for everyone , but do n't worry ! it 's not an acquired taste , its just a different taste \) br br product arrived fast thank to prime , fresh as i wanted , and the beans tasted just like they do when i buy them locally from rao 's bakery here in tx \( same beans same company \) . 
this coffee is smooth the best coffee ever it is pricey so i will not be buying it that often but worth every penny . 
i was thrilled to find a source for smoked paprika this product is the real thing wonderful , smokey flavor also , speedy service i will be using this website for all my gourmet spices ! . 
excellent product ! good price fast shipping needs an insert in lid to seal container better ! . 
i live in a small city in illinois and it is very hard to find certain products i was so pleased to see this product i watch so many programs on the food network neely 's being one i wanted this product to make their rub when it arrived quickly i may add you could smell the powerful scent through the package it was wonderful strong aroma , color and flavor this is the perfect product in a perfect size i once found a small bottle in a specialty store and paid almost 8 dollars for 4oz i'm not sure how many ounces is in this 6 inch bottle , but it is way more than 4oz i also got a great deal on the shipping i paid 7 95 for the first item and the rest was shipped free ca n't beat that ! i love this product ! ! ! . 
wonderful seasoning for the barbecue rub on chicken , meats , etc smoky paprika really enhances the flavour of the barbecued slow roasted delicacies also gives it a very appetizing appearance br br fast shipping , good price , well sealed , no problems would buy again br br q do you know the origin of the word barbecue \? br br a this word originated from the cooking methods of the barbary pirates who ate most of their meals cooked outdors on an open grill flame hence barbecue . 
this gives a good flaver to bar b q even if done in the oven it can be used to give a smokey flaver to food not done on a outside cooker . 
wow smoked sweet paprika is extremely hard to find in stores luckly i was able to find this huge container of smoked paprika for a really good price i found that it was a really good spice to use and it makes food taste as if you grilled it on a charcoal grill which is awesome give it a shot you might like it . 
i like the smoked sweet paprika better than other styles of sweet paprika it came fresh at a reasonable price . 
the paprika is good and the container will keep it fresh for some time i use these bulk spices to make my own barbque rubs the container is also recyclable for keeping the finished rubs . 
i 've been trying to find a good paprika for a rub used in the smoker this stuff is the absolute best that i 've found it 's sweet but still has all the flavor you want from paprika without being overly smoky if you make homemade rubs , i strongly recommend this stuff . 
i love , love this stuff i add it to meats for a great smokey taste i use it with herbs , other spices an brown sugar to make a super rub for bar b q . 
this is the smaller jar some what clumped , could benefit from anti cakeing agents however i wanted this for canning so it works well defiantly worth the price contains chili pepper , garlic , coriander , cumin , clove \( all smoked \) . 
this is one of the best mixed nut blends i have ever had ! br everything tastes extremely fresh and natural the flavor combination is amazing perfect mix of nuts and dried fruits i really like that this blend does n't include peanuts i'm tired of nut blends always including peanuts enough already ! this was a refreshing change and a great snack br i also feel the price is reasonable considering there are no peanuts , everything is natural , and it tastes great ! . 
i tried a small cup of sample at my local bj 's store and just loved it then i picked up 1 pack from the table right away , even forgot to check the price anyway , i will go back and see if the price is better at bj 's or at amazon . 
i found just enough of this product to be totally addicted now i ca n't find it anywhere , how come \? br it was the perfect blend to add to my morning hot cereal please bring it back br i agree that it was good in part because of no peanuts . 
i used this in a gift basket for a ladies tea i like the product myself very nicely packaged thank you . 
this product definitely works br i was not aware that i was supposed to break the tablet in half after eating a whole tablet , i ate a lemon it was way way too sweet ! br i waited 2 hours for the product to wear off so i could eat regular food br i tried a 1 2 tablet the next day i added some lemon to a glass of water to me , it tasted like lemonade with 5 packets of splenda it did n't taste like regular sugar which i guess is good the sweet taste was just different br i also ate cottage cheese , it tasted like cottage cheese with sweetener in it br the product works immediately by the way no waiting for this to work br br i think this product will last me a while br the day after this review i took a tiny nibble of the leftover 1 2 tablet i made another glass of lemon water and the lemonade was perfect for me not overly sweet , tasted like a lemon drop p br your mileage may vary with this product br br i 've heard that other brands taste a bit better than this one br i just ordered a pack from another company i will report back br br i have a huge sweet tooth and i'm trying to lose some weight i'm hoping these tablets will help me with that \) . 
wow , i did not expect such a quick , shocking result from this product , but it definitely delivers ! ! ! my brother told me about these tablets and the flavor tripping parties i had never heard of them before , but decided to give it a try just because the claim sounded so wildly strange , a sort of ripley 's believe it or not kind of novelty br anyway , the tablets work immediately i just took one , had a lemon , and voila' it 's sweet ! i also tried a sip of chianti wine sweet i poured a spoonful of white vinegar in a small glass of water sweet i have n't tried beer or other things , but sooner or later i will ! br the best thing i see coming out of this is that i finally do n't need to sweeten my tea ! i 'll just squeeze a lemon in and that will be that br hmmm perhaps i can add lemon juice to soda water and it can turn into a new diet soft drink ! ! the possibilities are endless ! . 
i do reccomend this product , as it is effective and very fun to try here are the setbacks it only lasts around 30 minutes , not 2 hours i bought these in lieu of the actual berries \( 90 vs 10 \) so they were n't as potent as i had read about expected nonetheless , they do work ! lemons and limes were delicious ! br oh , be sure to move the tablet over the entire surface of your tounge in order to cover all of your taste buds . 
basically these tables change the way you taste acidic things , they will instead taste sweet lemons taste like a strong lemonade some of you might be thinking , well that 's fun and all but how would my lover taste \? well , kind of sweet \( men and women \) give it a try you 'll see my only complaint is that they made them look so much like a drug that i had to convince some of my more prudish friends that it was just ground fruit . 
i saw an article on yahoo and figured i would give it a try this stuff was unbelievable i ate healthy foods for the first try some carrots , spinach , a red pepper and an orange it was probably the best meal i had ever tasted it was like i was eating a fruit picked from eden on the downside i could see this becoming an addiction ! . 
i got these for me and my boyfriend to try but he refused to try it with me at first i tried to explain to him that it 's just fruit put in a pill form but he was convinced it was some type of trick i was trying to pull on him anyways so i went to the store and picked up some lemons , limes , tomatoes , kiwi , oatmeal stout beer \( which i absolutely hate stout beer \) , sour candy and some red hots i let the pill dissolve on my tongue and started out trying a lemon one thing i recommend which i did n't do was to try out all the food first to get something to compare it to i sat in front of my boyfriend and ate a whole lemon without even flinching then i told him to try it and he could barely lick it without making a face then i tried some stout beer it tasted like cold coffee with a hint of kahluah i eventually got him to take one of the pills we had sooo much fun tasting foods ! ! it was amazing how much it worked ! ! ! ! i already recommended it to all my friends and now i recommend it to you it can be a really cool party trick by betting someone you can eat a whole lemon without making a face . 
after dissolving one tab on my tongue , i ate 1 4 of a large lime , and it tasted mostly sweet with just a hint of tartness ! i would have eaten the whole lime but was worried all that acid might upset my stomach i did n't notice any difference when i ate parsley , though the parsley still tasted somewhat bitter to me miracle berry worked extremely well for me with sour stuff , but not at all as far as i could tell with bitter stuff br br still , well worth the price to experience this amazing transformation in taste br br edit i had a craving for blackberries and bought a large container of them from a warehouse type store i planned on eating them all at one sitting , but after one or two i could n't eat them they were mostly sour and hardly any sweet i remembered that i had some of these tablets left , so i rolled one around on my tongue until it dissolved , and thereafter the blackberries tasted pleasantly sweet , so i was able to finish them all . 
the mberry tabs work by altering your taste receptors and make sour tasting foods more sweet i'm a high school science teacher , and i used these both in my classes and for my science club the students love trying out different sour food items to taste the results i 've used this brand several times , and it seems to be pretty consistent in it 's effectiveness and quality the best way i can describe the effect of these tabs is it makes a lemon taste like a lemon shake up from a fair carnival it does not create a super candy like sweetness \( which i think would be really weird anyway \) , there is still a hint of sour behind the sweet taste also , they do not last anywhere near an hour , more like 15 20 min , so just be warned , and be ready to taste things immediately after dissolving the pill in your mouth in my experience , there have been a percentage of people for whom the tabs are not effective , maybe between 5 15 in a group \( 1 3 people per 20 \) the tabs are somewhat expensive , but as a pretty unique experience , i definitely recommend trying it at least once ! . 
i just did a test run for a work party and i sampled raspberries , strawberries , lemons , limes , tabasco sauce , goats cheese , beer , orange juice , and yogurt first off , the lemon was the best tasting example of fruit i have ever had in my life i wanted to eat the whole thing the rest of the fruits tasted delicious the unsweetened yogurt was good , the orange juice amazing , and the beer much sweeter the goats cheese didnt taste that yummy to me and the tabasco sauce didnt have a noticeable change in flavor over all , a very fun and effective flavor changing experience ! . 
it does change the way you taste but not to such a great effect that you are expecting it 's more of a pleasant surprise and not a omg ! surprise it makes sour and most fruits sweeter it makes beer taste like some sort of sugary juice \( and i do n't like beer \) i would like to try cream cheese and wine which are supposed to be yummy i recommend this product and i only need a half a tablet to last about 45 min to an hour i would n't dare try spicy foods as they suggest on the package but they suggest pineapple , cheese , peppers , and limes lemon in water tasted like lemonade with tons of sugar i would experiement and see how it works out for you it does n't work on all foods though like potatoes or meats , as it mostly alters your sour or tart taste buds . 
my daughter had me buy these for her 18th birthday party what a success ! the tablets arrived ahead of schedule so we could concentrate on other items the kids had a fun time trying out sour foods that became sweet after letting the tablets melt in their mouth everyone had a great time and really enjoyed them we 're recommending them to everyone ! . 
great for parties this stuff actually works i was eating war heads , which i normally hate , like they were gummy bears eating a lemon tasted like drinking lemonade you 've got to try this stuff . 
i purchased these tabs for my daughters flavor tripping party i have never tried them out before so i invited a couple of friends over to experience this with me i set up a spread our items , gave everyone a mberry , and got to tasting the first item that we tried was a lemon and we were literally blown away because they were so sweet and tasty next came the dill pickle and it tasted like a sweet pickle we even tried ketchup and mustard and could n't stop dipping out fingers in it because the flavors were unbelievable we also had a bottle of cheap dry wine and it was delicious the strawberries were so delicious that we ate the entire bowl fruit rollups were great too this is something that i know my daughter will enjoy at her party and i will be trying these time and time again . 
after reading an article online a while back about flavor tripping , i went looking for miracle berries and was surprised to find these handy tablets on amazon i was worried they would n't pack the punch the actual berries were reputed to , but they turned out to be a great purchase br br it 's true that how effective they are varies by person , and by the foods you try them with , but overall these were a big hit at numerous gatherings of friends and family i 've found that the biggest hits tend to be vinegar , and tart citrus like lemons , limes , or grapefruit juice for me all go from being sour to very sweet \( yes , to the point where if i did n't know better i 'd be gulping the vinegar down \) dark beers are interesting , with the changed flavor still usually somewhat enjoyable foods or drinks that are already very sweet become cloying and unpleasant it 's still worth trying just to see the effect , but keep that in mind when choosing things to try with the tablets in advance br br i 've ordered these 4 times , and hope to do so again \( at the time of this writing , they are not available \) if they remain out of stock for too long , i 'll have to try some of the alternatives i'm reluctant to do so though , knowing how effective these are . 
my friend and i had a flavor tripping party for two we each dissolved one tablet on our tongues and then dug in to a plate full of lemons , limes and other sour items the effect was immediate and amazing we were laughing hysterically throughout the whole ordeal we also tried shots of vinegar , mustard by the spoonful \( really yummy \) and several other types of fruit we had a blast finding new things to try i think next we 're going to have a big group over to play around as other reviewers have mentioned , you can split the tablets in half to lessen the effect remember if you 're going to have a flavor tripping party of your own , pack some antacid after all we ate , we really needed it br br updates 12 20 i gave mberry pills to friends for the holidays the pills did n't work for all of them judging by some of the reviews the pills either do n't work for everyone or not every pill is the same potency i contacted the seller who put me in touch with the manufacturer and they are sending me out a replacement batch to give the people who had a bad experience excellent customer service all around i still wholeheartedly recommend giving the tablets a try if it works for you , it is really amazing . 
a friend referred me to these and told me that they were freaking awesome i decided to give them ago and surprisingly they work extremely well i found that the taste of them , while they are dissolving on your tongue is a bit horrid , but nothing i could n't tolerate br br after it dissolved me and some friends decided to test it we cut up some lemons and limes and decided to see if these really worked and to our amazement they really did the lemons tasted like a 'lemon drop' candy , and the limes were very refreshing we then expanded our horizons and started trying other things to see what it was like we found some other foods to be excellent , and others not so much all in all it 's very fun br br they are , however , quite expensive the effects on me lasted roughly 1 1 5 hours so as a novelty , hurray for these . 
this is a neat product , and it does what it says it does however , if you decide to have a party where you invite guests to partake of handfuls of raw cranberries , lemons juice , tabasco sauce , beer , mustard , and a variety of other items which are sour , the miracle berry can do nothing at all to augment the considerable effect this will have on their bowels . 
i ordered these after hearing about them from some friends i was very skeptical if it would even really work noticeably and was even more skeptical about the pill form but wow ! they really do work ! it makes anything bitter or sour taste instantly sweet i tried a few things and could definitely tell they were sweeter but the most noticeable was the lemon i really did n't even want to try it at first but i was told i had to it tasted like the sweetest and most flavorful lemonade ever seriously , it was like candy all of the sudden i almost could n't believe it when a few friends were over i gave them a pill each and we all of the sudden lemons were the best thing ever lol ! . 
i purchased this for my mother who is currently undergoing some powerful chemotherapy during her first chemo , she hated everything because everything tasted like metal and it was short of pulling teeth to get her to eat something she called me and asked me to order her this because an oncology nurse that she is friends with suggested it during her second chemo she ate all her normal foods and actually enjoyed it making the entire process of eating during chemo a small miracle we were so happy that she was eating because of this that we ordered more immediately ! . 
effects with some foods are more remarkable than others i found balsamic vinegar tasting fairly like wine to be one of the most remarkable . 
i got these tablets to try them out to see if they really worked and to my suprise they do and they made lemons taste amazing most of the other items on the list did not taste much better to me but i am still trying some out . 
after reading most of the reviews , i was expecting the tablet to taste gross it does not it 's not yummy , but it does have a slight \( tart \? \) flavor to it br br my first taste was of a strawberry it was way too sweet for me almost tasted like i had put tons of sugar on the strawberry , or even sugar substitute next i tried a blackberry , blueberry , pomegranate seed they were sweeter , but i was n't blown away by how good they tasted , just surprised at how my taste buds have changed next up , a lemon ! everyone has been right about the lemon , it tastes like lemonade ! i ate half of a lemon before i decided it was too sweet for me i put pomegranate flavored greek yogurt over the fruit i just mentioned , and had a bite too sweet for me ! next up , some fermented spicy daikon \( ever hear of dave 's gourmet korean food \? everything is fermented in vinegar and it is delicious ! \) the vinegar taste was gone , but the spiciness remained interesting i actually like the regular flavor , unaltered , so i wo n't be having that again oh , i also tried chocolate flavored coconut water yuck ! there was a chocolate chalky taste to it it has now been 30 minutes and i just tried the other half of the lemon it still tastes sweet to me and then i had a sip of veggie broth \( from dave 's korean \) which is the only thing that has changed in a way that was pleasing to my taste buds br br i'm giving the mberry four stars because it does do what it claims , it 's just not my preferred way of tasting things . 
make sure you salivate a lot and do n't swallow for best results they 'll typically last a few hours they 're a big hit for guests you can even get by with half after you 've had one or two does n't work too well on liquors but most sour and acidic foods there is a very noticeable effect . 
chewed a few of these and ate cheese , hot sauce and a bunch of citrus pretty neat stuff if it was less expensive i could see this benefiting those who 'd like to cut down on their sugar but still enjoy fruits . 
it works , that 's what matters people have to nit pick every little thing maybe it does n't last forever , but it 's not meant to br br my experience melted it on my tongue and ate some foods i could n't normally eat this means it worked , and real good highly recommended strawberries ! ! ! willing to buy these again just for eating strawberries limes are tasty too . 
i took these over to a friends house and tried them with amazing results after sucking on the pill and letting it dissolve for a few minutes , it really did make everything sour , taste sweet we tried lemons , limes , even sour candy the weird thing is , they did n't affect the taste of sweet things , like oranges these are great for a dinner party . 
before i bought this product i read several reviews saying that this stuff was amazing , that it made everything super sweet so i thought i would try it out , and it is pretty cool , but not worth the outrageous price about one minute after i sucked the tab i tried eating numerous things like limes , lemons , and oranges , just to name a few it did make everything that 's sour sweet not to the point of oh my god , it 's amazing but it did work so to sum this up , this stuff was good for a one time deal , but after doing it a few times it lost it 's appeal . 
the tablets do work but from i read in the description that half a tablet would work it does , but you have to make sure your whole tongue and mouth had decent contact with the tablet piece the tablet dissolves quite fast in your mouth so 1 2 tablet may be too little br br i tried again using 1 tablet and had good results then tried with 2 and had slightly better results the effect was pretty good lemons are still a bit sour to eat raw but its not that bad grapefruit is particularly awesome with this tablet limes were in between still a little sour but tasted quite nice overall i could still not eat too much lemon or lime and the acid content of both got me worried about stomaching too much . 
this is a great product i gave a few tablets away to family and friends and they all loved it it made anything with citric acid sweet , and even made some fruits sweeter its a real experience for the palet . 
this tablets were really fun to try out my parents , my siblings , and my friends all loved them and were so confused on how well they worked do not drink store bought orange juice though ! it was sickly sweet because of the sugar added and the acid in it ! my favorite was fresh pineapple and sucking on limes \( limes were sweeter for me than the lemons \) . 
this product makes me want to buy a miracle fruit tree so i can have these awesome berries all the time br br the biggest changes my husband and i noticed were in eating fruits other berries store bought strawberries , blueberries , raspberries , blackberries , oranges , and green apples tasted like they were just picked off the plant bush tree at the height of ripeness it was like being a kid again and biting into my first \) br br i did n't notice any change at all with anything bitter beers and coffees and teas tasted about the same spicy things like hot sauce tasted kind of gross savory things like noodles and meat got a slight hint of sweetness , but nothing that noticeable sweet things like candy and cake were made to be way too sweet to be palatable br br definitely make sure you get the tablet to slide all over your tongue , and do n't chew leave it on your tongue until it dissolves br br if you 're a fan of sweet , succulent fruit , but ca n't get fresh produce from farmer 's markets , do yourself a favor and try these it 's worth the price for the fun , at the very least \) . 
first things first , these actually work i tried tons of different foods and they all tasted a lot better if you have n't tried these already , it 's a must it is definitely a great experience . 
heard about these and simply had to check them out ordered a package and invited a few friends over after a huge shopping trip for an evening of flavor tripping that is exactly what it was , the tablets themself have an odd taste \( not the best \) but for two hours afterward everything we ate was completely different from anything i 've had before lemons , kiwi , strawberries , cheese , mustard , cranberry juice , oj , and a lot more it all was completely different and was like experiencing these foods for the first time everything was sweet and tasted \( with few exclusions \) much better i ended up eating whole lemons by the end because they were my favorite br br these really are amazing and i would recommend them to anyone who likes food . 
had fun with my family with the mberries , they absolutely worked for all 5 of us and it was a blast ! definitely worth a try ! . 
it really did help my father is a cancer patient and didnt want to eat because the taste was no good well the miracle berry gave him a good taste again . 
very interesting the tablet itself doesnt taste that great but it melts pretty fast the best stuff we found to try it with was apple and any citrus it really sweetens the fruit its kinda crazy it was fun . 
i just bought the mberry with slight concerns that it will not work all those concerns went away when i tried it it was a tingly feeling at first where ever it was on the tongue i did n't notice anything first thing i tried was a grape i mean this was the most delicious grape i had ever tasted i started try all the fruits and sodas i could amazing people do n't realize that you should use it on fruits and things with acidity it is supposed to make them sweeter although it did make one of my cookies sweeter it was n't nearly as dramatic as when i ate a lime it tasted like lime ade i would n't suggest eating a bunch of lemons because this only affects your tongue not your stomach when you buy these you run the risk that it wo n't work , but it probably will very pleased . 
fun to try really , they 're just an amazing way to eat lemons you can basically squeese lemons in water and it tastes delicious br br i ca n't tell the difference between brands seem pretty much the same to me br br they make a fun gift do n't buy them for a mind bending experience , they 're not drugs they 're a sort of food sweetener . 
the effect was just as described and worked for about 20 30 minutes i 'd recommend trying it if you 're interested you wo n't be disappointed . 
fun ! changes taste of so many things ! try it ! we almost drank a whole bottle of lemon juice after using this fruit that 's how well it works ! . 
i really enjoyed this , tried it with my family and my dad was so skeptical at first but when he took a bit into the lemon he was flabbergasted ! the look on his face was priceless best for groups of friends unless you experiment alone but the more the merrier ! wish it came with more berries per the price which is a bit steep for tablets and not the real berries which are hard to come by people said it lasts only a couple minutes but for me it was a decent 15 minutes or more obviously the lemons with juice and other fruits will make it end quicker since there are liquids washing it out just have everything prepared and on the table before you take it ! . 
i was researching the miracle berry protein miraculin for a research proposal , so i decided to give these tablets a try the effect was immediate , and lasted approximately 20 min for me and my coworkers everyone was completely in love with the lemons , and those who normally enjoy the flavor of lime went nuts over them as well for some the effect was actually too sweet , and they gave up after a few foods other foods beverages tested were blackberries and raspberries \( lost their tartness \) , red wine vinegar \( sweet on the tongue , but not so great in the throat \) and corona \( loses bitterness and is sweet if you squeeze some lime into it \) it certainly is not cost effective as a diet aid , but it 's a great parlor trick to share when you are entertaining . 
it works and lasts for a few minutes to make sours sweet its trippy . 
for a real tast treat , you have to try these sour foods taste sugary sweet apples , strawberries and oranges will taste like the most delicious fruit you 've ever had this makes for a fun party activity where guests will marvel over the wonderful vinegar and candy like limes . 
we found these tablets to be pretty fun ! i suggest dissolving a full tablet in your mouth , not cutting it in half as others suggested and definitely be sure to move the tablet around your entire tongue i missed the back of my tongue when dissolving the tablet so whenever i 'd swallow i 'd get a hint of the real flavor br br however , it was definitely neat to see how the tablet changes your taste ! ! we tried lemons , limes , grapefruit , buffalo wing flavored potato chips , sour patch kids , warhead sour spray , dill pickles , oranges , whiskey , and wine i found the ruby red grapefruit to be absolutely amazing the dill pickles tasted so much like sweet pickles , i had to double check the jar to make sure they were n't ! pinot grigio was particularly delicious , as the tablet cut through the sour ness turning it super sweet ! ! br br oranges were okay , just tasted a little sweeter than normal the lemons were still a bit sour but i found myself eating 4 slices of them , which i do n't think i could have done without the tablets ! i swear , the ruby red grapefruit was by far the best , in my opinion br br we found that the more sour a food , the more drastic an effect i definitely recommend trying these tablets with a full fridge so you can experience all types of foods ! i 'd say some grapefruit , lemons , and dill pickles are a must to try with these br br they 're great to try with friends , as the novelty wears off after one or two tries as long as there are new people around though , it 's fun to see other reactions to the tablets definitely recommend ! ! . 
i took one of these tablets , and the results were instantaneous i drank some pure lemon juice , and it tasted like very sweet lemonade my sister then tried it and spat it out immediately i then tried a lime , which was delicious , and some cheese i do not usually like cheese , but i after eating a little bit i was amazed at how wonderful it tasted with the tablets i highly recommend this product , beacuse it will amaze you the moment you start tasting . 
at first i did not think they would work , but i bought them after reading the scientific view of them and then decided to buy them just to see after i got them i had to try something sour just to see , so i took a half tablet and put some lemon juice on my tung amazingly they worked ! ! ! this is an awesome product for anyone who likes wired things or just has a liking of chemistry \) . 
i tried two lemons after dissolving two tablets in my mouth it tasted just like lemonade one thing the package recommends 1 tablet that did n't work for me if you are a tad overweight two is better . 
i seen this product on dr oz and i just had to try this out to see if it works yes , it works and i can eat and drink lemon juice three times a day br it is a miracle pill \) . 
i used the tablets and it made lime and lemon sweeter it was n't as sweet as all the other reviews claimed the lemon tasted like a sort of ripe orange i let my grandma try it , but she said it did n't work for her . 
as other reviewers have pointed out , the effects vary from person to person each tablet seemed to last up to a half hour \( longer for my sister \) and while it did make things noticeably sweeter , the initial taste of something was identical , and it slowly got sweeter after the first half a second oh , and sour bitter drinks like monster took on a sickly sweet syrupy flavor that may leave you feeling a bit ill after do n't try apple cider vinegar , it tastes fine if a bit odd on your tongue , but as soon as it hits your throat the flavor and fumes were overpoweringly awful . 
i 've had this a few times before and it is amazing last time i had it a half pill was one dose so i thought this was a bit cheaper than it turned out to be but it 's still great and well worth it at 2 per dose i like that it also came with some recommended foods to try lemons and limes are by far the best , beer is pretty cool too . 
the mberry tablets worked great we tried a lot of the suggested pairings and most of them had some sort of fun taste after eating the tablets . 
i was curious and decided to buy this product because of it \( and despite the price \) it worked and is seriously cool i followed the directions by putting a whole tablet on my tongue and letting it completely dissolved sliced up a lemon and very warily put it in my mouth just to find that it tasted like a sweet lemonade there was only a slight tinge of sour i would have happily kept eating lemons , as they were delicious , the the acid on my lips told me to stop i plan on buying much more of this product in the future it works and is fantastic ! . 
it was crazy , it made things taste super sweet , some things not at all though however , this deliverer was extremely reliable and i receiver my package a day early a first for me with amazon ! . 
my friend brought this over for a party , and we tried the limes , lemons , oranges and bananas ! the initial taste of the tablet is pretty nasty , but just stick with it until it 's dissolved completely on your tongue , coating it after that , sour fruit like lemons and limes taste like the best sour candy you have ever tasted in your life and you will devour them d . 
it does work , but only for a short time you need to dissolve it on your tongue and then let the fun begin ! . 
this stuff works , but be warned the effect does n't last very long for some people but it is still amazing my friend and i tried eating a lemon slice and it was amazing until the effect started to wear off slightly in the middle of it . 
a very interesting and fun way to spend an evening the tablet itself has a somewhat tart flavor , we sampled everything from cottage cheese to beers to fruits to salt and vinegar chips to warheads some differences were astounding , some not so much , great little adventure for your mouth . 
just a tad expensive , but neater than heck ! ! it really does what it says ! awesome ! ! . 
they were n't mind blowing , but they were definitely fun so far i 've tried mine with a beer and a few snack foods everything did taste noticeably sweet , especially the beer it ended up tasting like a cream soda br br i'm looking forward to some more experimenting \) . 
these tablets are quite odd , but they do work they have a sort of chalky taste as you let them melt on your tongue , but if you get past that the effect is amazing we ate whole lemons and limes oranges tasted like candy it lasts for quite awhile too they are definately worth a try . 
this mberry product really worked for my friends and i unfortunately , it only worked for about 15 to 20 minutes at most it still made for a really fun experience ! br the food items that were the most awesome included cream cheese \( tasted like cheesecake \) , grapefruit \( tasted sweet without added sugar \) , lemons \( tasted like they had grown from a lemonade tree \) , and various assortments of beer \( just a different taste all together \) br definitely worth the 15 bucks if you are a foodie and want to experience this food trend . 
bought some of these after getting frustrated about not being able to grow the plant at my house \( for those curious , i live in northern california \) i 've always been intrigued after seeing numerous videos on the internet i have to admit , i was a bit skeptical br br when i got the package , i popped a whole tablet in my mouth and let is swish around my entire tongue until it dissolved as for the flavor , if any of you have had haw flakes from any asian market , that 's what it tastes like for those who do n't know , do n't worry , it 's nothing disgusting kinda bland , to be honest after is dissolved , the first thing i tried was a lime verdict sweet not overly sweet , but still sweet kind of like a lemonade just a tad of sugar missing next up , apple cider vinegar verict sweet does n't taste exactly like apple cider like some people say , but i see what they 're saying last test is cheese it tasted different , but not exactly a big change br br as for how long it lasted , i would say after 30 45 minutes , it started to fade after an hour , it was gone br br bottom line , it was fun to try it out and i will definitely be trying out more things in the future as for hosting a flavor tripping party \? maybe a good business venture . 
this is my first time with the miracle berries in general we got a bunch of friends over and everyone brought something oranges taste like the orange slice candies and lemons taste like lemon drops my favorite is the christmas beers that are available this time of year , they were almost like apple cider everyone had fun everything arrived fast , great seller 5 stars ! ! ! . 
these tablets definitely made things sweeter like lemons , limes , and grapefruit but it was n't to the point of sheer amazement they also had an interesting effect on cheeses and vinegar , but still did virtually nothing for beer and wine the tablets are a bit pricey but they do work if you 've got extra money , sure , give them a try , but if you 're looking for some amazing way to get your kids to eat broccoli or something along those lines then this is not the answer fun experiment , but not life changing \) . 
it works i took one , 2 minutes later i was trying different things in my mouth last thing im trying right now is beer and it taste different and sweat if your into trying new things give these a try i read that it wont work on some people but well chalk this as a did work for me review . 
in reading the reviews here it is obvious that different tastebuds are affected very differently at first i believed the tablets did nothing even though i used a whole one bitter foods and drinks still tasted bitter to me sweet foods and drinks did n't taste any sweeter i was prepared to write the whole thing off as placebo effect on the part of some people but the positive reviews made me try again it was when i drank pure lemon juice that i noticed a difference pure lemon tasted like lemonade so the product does work , it just may not work exactly as advertised for you . 
this stuff really works , makes lemons taste sweet gave to a friend , she loved it and ordered 3 to give to her friends great party idea , try mberry with all sorts of foods , will change their flavor , fun to experiment . 
this is quite neat ! i could drink a glass of vinegar and it would taste just like syrup ! it is certainly worth trying . 
this stuff is transcendence in a can ! i swear its that good the vanilla flavor is perfect , not too sweet to be artifical , and not too malted to taste funky br its velvety smooth and absolutely perfect around the holidays \( although we drink it year 'round \) like other fans , i order it by the case for myself and my family at home , i take a can or two to work , and usually giving more away as parts of gift baskets and things like that its perfect paired with fresh baked cookies or alone with a good book when you want to snuggle up and feel relaxed br i dont drink coffee , so im a connesiur of cocoa type drinks this stuff is amazing ! get some and you will see exactly what i mean . 
at my house , we call it hot vanilla this is the best hot chocolate type drink i 've ever tasted i am a lifelong chocoholic , but now i order stephen 's french vanilla by the case because all the others pale in comparison , and i just do n't want them anymore you wo n't regret springing for a case of it makes a terrific gift too mmmmmmm . 
stephen 's hot chocolate is the best hot chocolate in the world i wo n't drink any other hot chocolate the french vanilla is my personal favorite . 
this has a very dark chocolate flavor that mixes quickly and smoothly in hot water no chucks like most of the other brands milk chocolate is fine for those who enjoy that but for real chocolate lovers that enjoy the true flavor of dark chocolate , do n't miss this . 
this product is out of this world if you like chocolate and you like peppermint you will fall in love with this i had it years ago and never could find it again until this past christmas time at costco as a seasonal item so when i found this i stocked up br i love it . 
i ordered this as the price was certainly right \( 6 1lb cans for less than 30 \) and the reviews were good br br this is certainly a step up in the hot cocoa market better than just about anything you can find in the supermarket i certainly prefer hot chocolate but it can be time consuming to make and it 's tough to heat milk and melt chocolate at work or in class br br this is the perfect compromise for when you want that chocolate drink and are n't in a position to 'do it right' br br very good taste and dissolves well i always use a little more than it says on the can with some cocoa that means it wo n't all dissolve this is not a problem here br br certainly recommended . 
i purchased this product as a gift for my mom who simply loves this cocoa when the local supermarket where she purchased the cocoa stopped stocking it she figured that was the end of it ha ! little did she know that i would find a way to track it down on line and on amazon ! she was surprised and pleased the price is good , as is the cocoa i would only be more happy if i could get an assortment . 
this is my family 's favorite hot cocoa brand the kids favorite flavor if mint chocolate . 
i ran into this product at a bed and breakfast unlike most hot chocolate mixes with another flavor component , the raspberry flavor in this is an equal partner with the chocolate you do n't get just a hint of it that soon gets lost you taste the raspberry with the first sip and the last sip very very enjoyable highly recommend . 
this is absolutely delicious because it is in powder form , you can make it as strong or weak as your taste buds allow i add instant folger 's to mine , making it into a mocha that also cuts the sweetness it really does taste like chocolate covered cherries a treat i have loved since childhood ! br br i get mine through the subscription program along with several other flavors from stephen 's the subscription program works well for me since i travel you can change the frequency and the address to which it is to be sent as needed . 
i found the packets at walmart for 57 cents i believe , but when i went back a week later they did n't have anymore ! i also checked cvs and walgreens and they did n't have it either i was so happy i found it on amazon and in cans which i think is a better deal than packets because you get more product this is definately the best hot chocolate i 've ever had the peppermint is n't over powering like most peppermint hot chocolates i 've had i 'll definately be buying more when i run out ! . 
i absolutely love this stuff ! my dad used to give us each a can \( or two \) for christmas every year , and it was always a favorite i 've never been able to find it where i live now , i should of known to check amazon ! by the way , i 've never tasted a variety i did n't like , but i 've never tried the reduced fat kind , either i also like to make it with coffee instead of water when i need a little boost , it almost makes coffee taste good \( sorry , but there 's nothing out there that can do that \) . 
i like stephen`s gourmet hot cocoa , white chocolate mix , because to me it taste like arabian white chocolate , the taste is almost identical , if it had a little arabian vanilla it would be a copy cat this cocoa to me has alot of class , unlike the others this stephens white chocolate mix has alot of class i just have to say thankyou stephen , i really enjoy sipping white hot cocoa again a friend told me how delicious this cocoa was , i never imagined how delicious i am so glad i purchased it , thankyou stephen , a customer for life ! terry merrill . 
i purchased this for my girlfriend who loved this stuff over the xmas period now she has a supply which should last several months . 
without a doubt this cannot be surpassed i am always so conscientious about calorie count until i took a sip of this i will just ration it for special moments even the cat 's nose was twitching from the delightful scent it is hard to believe that it was made in usa if my daughter is lucky i might send her some at christmas it is a good thing i live alone or else i would have to hide it . 
if you have n't tried the stephens candycane cocoa you need to try it but only if you like chocolate and mint flavors it 's great tasting the only problem is that i want it year around and it is only available in stores at christmas . 
i tried stephen 's chocolate mint truffle hot chocolate mix at a church function and it was wonderful , i had to get some . 
i 've tried them all and keep coming back to the belgian chocolate a chocoholic 's dream i drink this every morning and this seem 's to be the most economical way to buy it , 6 cans at a time . 
we have been drinking stephen 's candycane cocoa for several years our walmart carries it at christmas time , but they run out fast it 's the candycane pieces in the cocoa that make it soo good ! you can make it as strong or weak as you like it , by adding more cocoa or more water than the directions say i like it a little stronger it gives it a bold chocolate taste with a strong candycane kick ! i do n't know what else to tell you except it is absolutely out of this world ! all you need is a cup , a spoon , hot water , and stephen 's candycane cocoa you 're set , drink up ! just remember not to use it all up in one setting ! br br honestly , the only thing i would change about this product is the number of cups of cocoa per can it calls for 3 1 2 rounded tablespoons of cocoa mix per 6 ounces of hot water when sara and i make a 12 oz cup each and each have a refill , we can almost kill off one can in a sitting \( yes , it is that good ! \) i wish stephen 's could concentrate this or put it up in larger cans br br i hope i have helped in your purchasing decision . 
well , i love hot cocoa but this is truly different it literally has bits of candy cane mixed into the cocoa mix and it is a refreshing warm you from the inside out hot cocoa drink if you are someone that is n't sold on peppermint in your hot cocoa you just have to try it the peppermint is very subtle but very pleasing to the palate truly different from any hot cocoa that i have ever enjoyed . 
my husband is a huge fan of hot cocoa i surprised him with a 6 pack of stephen 's peanut butter cup hot cocoa it actually has little peanut butter cups in it they quickly melt into this delicious treat we highly recommend this product and will buy it again . 
i originally received this mint truffle hot chocolate as a gift , and was a little bit dismayed that the instructions say to mix it with water , because in the past that always results in a weak flavor amazingly , that is not the case with this mix , even with no milk added this has a great rich , chocolate mint taste br br because it does n't require milk , i can keep it at work for a warm up drink on cold office days i usually put 4 teaspoons of mix in my a href http www amazon com gp product b002p6855y aladdin 16 ounce recycled and recyclable tumbler , lily a then add hot water from the dispenser at work for a perfect mug of hot chocolate . 
i bought this hot chocolate at a grocery store because it looked interesting we like to drive around our neighborhood and look at the christmas lights i always like to drink hot chocolate while enjoying this outing oh my gosh ! this hot chocolate was incredible when i opened the can to make it , i saw pieces of candycane candy in the chocolate powder i made it the way that they suggested , with hot water , not milk it was so creamy with just the right amount of peppermint flavor there were no lumps and it was excellent to the last drop i am thrilled to see that they carry this on amazon because i know that the grocery store only carried it for the holidays and the price on amazon is much less than i paid . 
these folks are right this stuff is very rich and we just use skim milk richer than the expensive chocolate shavings we have splurged on in the past the tins go along ways too the per serving cost is a fraction of buying the individual packets at the grocery store of other brands , but i would pay more anyway because this stuff is so good we just had to order another case try it with some coffee mash it up in some vanilla ice cream seems like they could sell it for much more if they got rid of the dude 's first name first name only brands really cheese up the product how about cocoa passions or divine cocoa or even , serenity now cocoa anything would glam up the product name a little i am a builder , would you buy an expensive house from kreg 's stately mansions \? nope does n't matter how choice the work is i am sorry , stephen , you do have a great product , i 'll stop oh well , keep the prices low five stars , brother . 
i was looking for something to replenish one of my favorite black forest \( cherry chocolate \) hot cocao mixes and this one works quite well and tastes even better keep up the good work . 
i love stephen 's gourmet hot chocolate it arrived quickly and we have been enjoying it for at least a month now . 
i just bought a six pack of stephen 's gourmet hot cocoa mix it 's pretty good for the price my favorite will always be ghirardelli but this does the trick in a pinch . 
this is the perfect cocoa to sit by a fire listen ot the rain cuddle next to your loved ones i had to order it on amazon , since it was only available in ut where i used to live i'm so glad i ordered it ! choc rasp is the best flavor but chocolate hazelnut , chocolate mint , and milk chocolate are also excellent . 
i really enjoyed this , and will probably be purchasing other flavors as well \( if they are re stocked it seems that most of them are sold out \) i wanted something a little better than what i find in my area grocery stores , and this was really good the first time we made it , it was with milk , and it was a little too rich for me \( which i thought was impressive , especially as i was only using skim milk \) , so i 've since moved to a combination of milk and water , and it tastes great \( and i 'll probably still make it with just milk , after adjusting more towards that over time \) my house is known for hot cocoa \( we have at least 7 options right now \) , but everybody who has had this has enjoyed it . 
has just enough of the raspberry taste without being over bearing will purchase more in the future when my supple depletes i had trouble finding a good raspberry hot cocoa but now i know where to get it this site will be one of my favorites . 
do you like dark chocolate \? wish you could find quality dark chocolate cocoa mix \? this is the real deal ! i have tried a few different dark chocolate mixes this one stands above others in it 's smooth'ness and creamy quality nice and dark , add some honey or cinnamon and you 'll have a fantastic cuppa cocoa . 
i have tasted several stephen 's gourmet products , but the chocolate raspberry is my favorite it 's creamy , smoothe and delicious i consider it my one splurge for myself i have a cup every morning and have now shared my favorite beverage with my son , who just cannot get enough of it he has created different recipes with it , one using ice cream i will stick to the original method it 's the best hot cocoa mix i have ever tasted the aroma alone will draw you in i am often asked what is that wonderful smelling beverage occasionally i will share in hopes they will purchase their own stephen 's gourmet makes the best cocoa ever i will drink it as long as they continue to make it . 
i love this stuff ! this is my favorite of the flavors i have tried i do feel like i have to add quite a bit of chocolate powder to get it to the flavor that i like , but that is okay i 'd take this over any of the other stuff any day swiss miss is for the kids and this stuff is for me my husband loved the milk chocolate until he tried the amaretto i just stick with this because i have n't found that i like the others as much even though i do n't like the others as much , all of the stephen 's cocoa that i have tried is the richest out there it does n't taste like i mixed it with water at all . 
my wife absolutely adores this cocoa very easy to make , just hot water which for her is a plus br she prefers this over ghiradelli . 
this really is the best hot chocolate i have ever tried ! and at this price , a terrific deal it was delivered fast and as described a . 
i love hazelnut smell in my coffee so i figure it will also be great to have it in a cup of hot chocolate unfortunately this product does n't give me a strong hazelnut feeling , just a little well it is still a good one . 
enjoy the taste , milk free product ilike milk in hot cocoa , just ca n't see adding powdered milk b u t , it is considerably less expensive at a local chain grocery store in my area i prefer a mix of this and ghiradelli double choclate . 
this is the best candy cane cocoa , and it has real bits of candy cane do n't worry , it 's not totally sharp most of it dissolves in the liquid br br i mix my cocoa with a battery operated frother , which uses every single bit of cocoa , so there is not a single bit of cocoa on the bottom br br after , it 's really a pepperminty cup of chocolate that is very lovely refreshing , i 'd say br br this is a must with milk , though i think you can do it with water but milk is best to get the full flavor effect . 
if you 've read the other reviews about stephens hot chocolate , well , the same for this one it tastes rich and good i'm diabetic type ii and there is nothing else in hot chocolate that comes close without being loaded with sugar diabetes really narrows the field when it comes to things you can eat or drink so am glad that stephens makes this product in every shiny white cloud there is a bit of soot hiding somewhere the lump of coal is that they do n't sell it in canada and wo n't ship across the border that is so sad canadians having to deal with yet another item they ca n't get not sure why this is whether us government , canadian border guards with a grudge , or stephens just do n't want extra paper work thank goodness for friends who go on trips down south and bring it back for me good stuff . 
purchased original can at walmart of course , during the holidays it was n't always there i got on amazon com and found a really good deal on it my family i loved it thru the holidays and will be taking a canister of it with us when we go camping and using it year round good good product taste ! . 
make per directions and use half half to top off for richer taste , maybe a little whipped cream topper and you have have a melt in the chair , soft spot , where visions of sugar plums and the like may begin to dance in your heads yummy and so delicious i 've purchased twice , first at near 13 each for two , then near 5 each for six of them chalk it up to when you 're buying ! i should make clear that i do not regret my initial purchase , i was merely showing an example when timing can play a part in the value of this kind of transaction please allow me to elaborate that i initially selected chadwell retail sellers as i was trying the product , and it seemed reasonable given the value for two to select them to complete my purchase i have no qualms with the seller and would openly consider their services on this open market again as the purchase made sense thank you for reading this far and for your consideration in advance . 
i also tried the cherry chocolate and peanut butter cup flavors and they are amazing ! so thick and creamy , especially if you make it with a little milk ! what i really like is that they are n't overly sweet , and that it mixed together very well , unlike most brands that just clump up and stick to the spoon definitely my favorite hot chocolate ! the cider flavors are great too ! . 
this is simply the best hot chocolate mix i have ever used the flavor is wonderful , whether you like hazelnut or not \( the hazelnut flavor is subtle \) it tastes like you made it from scratch rather than a mix it 's difficult to find , so locating it on amazon was a great find . 
i ordered this about a year ago and have repeatedly ordered it since everyone i have shared it with has loved it so much they have also gotten right on amazon and ordered it also i mix it in my coffee , and when i am feeling particularly naughty , top it off with whipping cream delicious ! ! ! ! ! . 
delicious taste just like a chocolate covered cherry i especially like it added to coffee will give as gifts this year ! . 
i bought this mostly based on the reviews i really wanted hot chocolate from stephen 's , but amazon did n't have it i stumbled across this and thought i would try it it is white , even though cocoa is in the title in case you did n't figure that out ! i did realize it was n't chocolate , but did n't really know what to expect br br the best way i can describe it is that it tastes like a vanilla milkshake , but hot ! i happen to love vanilla milkshakes way more than chocolate ones \( but hate drinking milk , go figure \) , but somehow , i haven gotten used to this product after about a week i have 6 cans now , so i have many more opportunities to try ! it may just be that i sort of mentally expect hot chocolate and i have to retrain my slow brain ! it is interesting and different , and i still drink it , and almost like it , but still would pick pick the hot chocolate over this definitely worth a try if you like vanilla . 
this is my absolute favorite hot chocolate ! stephen 's gourment hot cocoa is all over utah , but i have been unable to find it anywhere else i love it so much that i even pay shipping and handling so that i can enjoy it all the way on the east coast , too it 's so good ! i look forward to it every year . 
this is by far the best hot chocolate i 've ever tasted ! all the other flavors are good , especially the raspberry , but this one is my favorite i use just hot water , and it tastes rich and creamy ! . 
i am on my second can , i ordered the case of 6 and i keep it hidden from the grandkids i never thought you could have good tasting dark hot chocolate i just heat a cup of water in the microwave for 80 seconds and add the chocolate it dissolves completely with stirring . 
i bought a can of stephen 's hot cocoa over 5 years ago not realizing how good it was going to be after i drank the first few cups i was hooked and could not find it anywhere again i ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the uk with me when we moved over taking care to make them last i'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it 's rich flavor surpasses all others i 've tried if you love dark chocolate this is it i have n't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good i may order some for stocking stuffers for christmas br br i also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug cup the pre measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way if you 'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1 2 milk and 1 2 water you really do n't need marshmallows . 
what can i say \? \? \? this is delicious on any day sip til your heart 's content . 
i love hot chocolate but do n't drink milk this is the best hot chocolate i 've tasted using just plain water . 
i do n't think there is a better hot cocoa \( especially at this price \) on the market than stephen 's it lasted me the entire winter and made for awesome x mas gifts now everyone i know buys it and i'm even happier to be spreading it around my only issue is that i wish they would have a mixed pack a 6 pack of mint , hazelnut , regular , dark , vanilla and irish cream would really be perfect ! . 
i love all of the cocoa in the stephen 's gourmet line , but i think this one is my favorite the other people in my family have different favorites \( we all love stephen 's \) , but we all agree the belgian dark ranks at the top for the best all purpose drinking cocoa br br i like my cocoa with a little added milk in it , and starting out with a good dark cocoa allows me to achieve that milky texture without sacrificing that rich chocolate flavor br br as an added bonus , stephen 's cocoa is labeled gluten free taking the guesswork out of choosing a cocoa for those of us who must avoid gluten containing additives such as barley malt \( a common ingredient in chocolate \) . 
this stuff has an absolutely incredible taste very smooth and you can mix it with water or milk if you like vanilla and you have n't tasted this stuff you are missing out ! br br get it , it 's worth it ! . 
i love stephens chocolate raspberry it is the best i 've ever had other brands i 've tried were bitter and just not as tasty br it stirs in smooth , no lumps br my order arrived quickly , just as promised i'm a very happy consumer of this product and the supplier . 
i tried this unknown manufacturer stephen 's and was pleasantly surprised it had a good amaretto flavor along with the chocolate the aroma is good i use it in my coffee for a homemade mocha taste . 
the belgian dark chocolate is the best hot cocoa i 've ever had so far and my 4 year daughter agrees she pinicky about her chocolates preferring only to eat dark chocolate and this dark choco hot cocoa sure passed the test with her she prefers to drink it with just warm water instead of milk as using milk makes it taste like milk chocolate i do , too ! . 
stephen 's is absolutely the best hot chocolate i have ever tasted ! it is so creamy and delicious every flavor i 've ever tried is excellent my whole family loves it i do n't know any stores in the area that sell it , so we are thrilled to be able to order it through amazon . 
i like the taste of chocolate and mint it mixed well when i added hot water next i might try a warm milk . 
i love the honey lacquat , i have been using it for years , and i am sharing it with other's . 
i love really good coffee and , in fact , go to great lengths to brew the best i e freshly ground beans , purest water , immaculate coffee maker , etc i have been extremely happy with virtually all of jeremiah 's coffees and , i have a number of different beans on hand at all times the breakfast blend is stand out also , try this and their fogbuster you will not be disappointed aaaa . 
an organic coffee for less than 6 a pound \( with subscribe and save \) with great taste , you ca n't beat that this is my only coffee choice for now i would rather have this than starbuck 's any day of the week . 
this coffee is phenomenal for the taste and value i'm on subscribe and save and this is my daily brew , i typically go though 2 lbs a month or so this coffee has an excellent flavor and is not bitter or spicy , beats starbucks breakfast blend hands down . 
my senses were surprised by the aroma of the glistening beans as well as the satisfying flavor of the brew br i substituted this bean when amazon dropped starbucks sumatra from their subscribe save program br now i would never go back br i use a ceramic cone drip filter into a nissan thermal carafe for our brew br for an organic bean , this breakfast blend is top of the heap br . 
this is the best tasting coffee at the most reasonable price for organic ! smooth taste perfect for your morning brew . 
you get a fresh , bold , thick flavor from this coffee never bitter i am addicted i blend it with there decaf at night so that i can sleep great price . 
this has become our new coffee of choice for the mornings it 's a good price for a solid cup of organic coffee beans are medium roast and very fragrant . 
the organic breakfast blend has an appealing mild flavor it is very reasonably priced for an organic coffee i will definitely be buying more in the future ! . 
a great coffee , that is medium roast , not bitter yet it tastes as good as it smells it is also well bagged to maintain optimum freshness mmmmmmm . 
this is my second batch of coffee from jeremiah 's pick this is good coffee but not as good as their foglifter however , it you like a mild yet tasteful coffee , you will like this i prefer a bit stronger brew though hence my preference for the foglifter . 
i liked everything about the transaction , although i am sure that i ordered ground but i received whole bean i especially liked the price and the speed of delivery . 
cinnamon toast have always been a favorite for me and my family its good and crispy if u dont let it sog in milk to much br as far as price value its a pretty darn good deal i think at costco u can get a similar price for there twin pack according to my aunt but i dont have a membership with them so i stick to amazon enjoy just keep in mind just as other cereals it has lots of sugars and proccesed carbs so eat wise and stay sharp . 
we love this cereal i purchased this product and everything was great ! the cereal was good until jan 2012 , but of course my family has already eaten the cereal gone in like two weeks we do eat these as a snack more than anything i would recommend buying this cereal . 
as usual this cereal tastes so good ! the boxes came quickly and timely i wish this deal did n't stop ! . 
this is one of the few cereals that i find very tasty just on its own as a snack or as dessert crunchy with a nice cinnamon flavor it is very sweet , however i prefer to mix it with something such as cheerios when eating it for breakfast since the sugar can be overpowering as you get close to the bottom of the bowl br br good value if you can get it on an amazon price dip and or when they run a promo . 
i was crazy about these as a kid ! they are tubes simply filled with a flavored powdered candy that has tons of sugar in it i first tried their cute little wax paper tubes that were about 8 inches long when i was about 7 years old goes to figure that my 8 year old is nuts about these now we used to take our change to the local conveniance store they came in grape , cherry , and orange , lime and other fruit flavors those were very good but there are also the big 21 inch thick plasitc tubes that hold the equivelant of 20 of the paper ones this offer gets you a case of 48 packs of 3 tubes each in grape , maui punch , cherry , and orange flavors lots of fun from the willy wonka factory . 
there has been no alteration to the formula these confectionery treats taste just like they did in 1978 when i first used to pour them into my mouth and since they are wrapped in smaller packages of three sticks \( oh sorry , stix \) , they can be savoured \( savored for my southern friends \) for a lot longer . 
these fruit filled rawhide donuts are wonderful our yellow lab goes nuts when we just take one out of the pantry ! best eaten outside or on the kitchen floor , not carpeting , because little pieces of the fruit do drop out during the feast our dog loves the fruity part so much he licks them up ! br a dog may be man 's best friend , but these are definitely a dog 's best friend ! ca n't recommend them enough ! . 
easy to follow directions the grass grew fast and strong my dogs are eating it right now and i know it safe and healthy ! . 
i bought this for my guinea pig and he loves it br br its insanely easy to grow it seems like it grows an inch by the second 1 square will definitely last me for more than a few weeks br br if you 're looking to grow your own wheat grass , look no further , this stuff is awesome . 
i was having trouble finding pet grass consistently in my area and decided to take a chance using a grow kit the kit was very easy to use and the grass grew like crazy since i have only one cat i am now using about 1 3 of planting soil and seeds at a time and this works out great i highly recommend this product . 
i tasted this matcha from rishi the first time today the flavor is bright , assertive and fresh it mixes nicely into both hot and cold liquids , leaving no clumps of tea at the bottom of my glass after it was whisked the tea powder is fine , giving it smoothness , no grittiness or grainy feel i had it both in water and with milk in both the flavor was not muddied the flavor is more intense \( bold \) than most matcha i 've had , making others seem bland by comparison nothing off putting , just seems more concentrated it has a good crisp green color , and each packet holds about one tablespoon of matcha i am glad this order was for a pack of 2 because i can see myself going through one box quickly . 
i love it tastes great and it is very convenient to use my husband drinks that in the car instead of soda or juice lt just pour the powder to 32oz water bottle and shake well directions on the box say to use 500ml \( 16 9oz \) but the tea is really strong so we use 1l bottle \) my kids love it i love it in whole food 1 box costs 20 tax here you can get 2 boxes for the price if you use all promotions \( currently 35 off \) still quite expensive but well worth it ! . 
this is a great tasting tea i know it is a very healthy and nutritious tea but in order to have one of these a day i have to be willing to spend at least 60 a month for this tea that 's two dollars a pop and after it ads up i simply ca n't justify the expense br br i mean , for crying out loud , it 's a sixteen ounce cup of tea i know people spend more at starbucks for something less healthy but i just ca n't afford to have this everyday i can use that sixty bucks for a lot of other things in fact , i decided to use the sixty dollars and buy dark green leafy vegetables at the supermarket along with other nutritious vegetables actually , i only need to spend a fraction of that amount per month and i get a lot more food br br i know the polyphenols are supposed to be the highest quality in rishi green tea but i will stick to buying kirkland brand \( costco \) or treasure island 's green tea and save quite a bit of money br br an acquaintance of mine told me about this tea and how it was really good for the immune system due to my challenges with illness and deciding to follow the advice of a person who spoke highly of the health benefits of this tea i decided to buy it unfortunately , i get blood work done on a regular basis and after nine weeks there was no noticeable change improvement to justify the expense of this product it did nothing to improve my health and the lack of improvement in my blood work supports this so i am no longer going to buy it i would buy it if i could pay around 20 for a month 's supply \( for just one tea serving daily \) , but not 60 it 's not worth it br br the only reason i'm giving this product four stars is because it does taste very good especially with a few droplets of liquid stevia extract added to the mixture . 
i waited quite a while before following my impuslse to buy smoked salmon and spinache mousse , manufactured by gourmetfoodstore of course , it 's expensive , and i ahd to save up for it and it 's quite caloric , as well however , the picture of this gourmet treat finally did get to me , and after returning to this picture and this product several time could n't resist it any longer for me , it was my royal treat , to celebrate the royal wedding of prince william and kate middleton ! br br well , my package arrived a bit after the wedding , \( today , actually \) but that 's because i ordered it a bit after the wedding , \( may 6 , to be exact \) i kept reminding myself how expensive this really is , and how even the queen saves money whenever , and wherever , she can but it was no good i had to at least try this stuff at least once br br the package , marked perishable , had stood out in my hallway for a few hours , as i was out this morning upon opening the outer cardboard box , then the inner styrofoam box , \( repleate with cold bags , to keep the pershable food inside fresh \) , i came across a small brown cardboard box which held my smoked salmon mousse inside , was not one big package , as i had expected , but , instead to my delight sixt small black plastic tubs ! it seems , happily , that no matter how much you order of this somoked salmon mousse , it will always be packed in these elegant little black plastic tubs the black contrasts nicely with the smoked salmon mousse peeking through both sides of the large yellow label , that almost but not quite covers the food within the label says terroirs d'antan in big letterss , and i take it this means land of antan , \( and not terrors therefrom \) , br as terre means land in french three ducks on one side and one rabbit on the other side of the central terroir 's d'antan are inhabiting the yellow label , and we can see , in the far right distance , a huge building that looks like a french chateau and , indeed , right below this , in smaller letters , are the words , br the selection 'terroirs d'antan' revives ancient recipes from the vearious terroirs of france enjoy but further down the label , it is revealed that the product was 'made in usa distrib by optimus , inc , miami fl 33138 br br the larger box in which this individual serving , \( actually , containing 3 servings 7 ounces \) , black plastic box came , described the contents as being packed in aspic and so it is when the vaccum packing , transparent plastic covering is removed , there still is another transparent layer to be removed my own experience with aspic had heretofore been , mainly , with learning of the title of a movie , a dandy in aspic , starring the late , \( and really great \) , laurence harvey i have yet to see the movie and have never , really , known what 'aspic' is , exceptthat it is some sort of foodstuff well i discovered , upon taking what must be aspic off the top op of the salmon mousse , that it is similar to the temporary , plastic 'dots' that are sometimes used to keep products on cardboard backings , but are \( somewhat \) easily removed a type of transparent jello , actually about 1 8 inch thick br br well , finally i had the mousse in front of me , and it was time to eat it ! br br the flavour was milder rhan i had expected perhaps because cream cheese is the first ingredient the smoked salmon flavour does come through , on occasion , and it is a nice , dark , smoked salmon flavour , indeed ! but there is far too little of this wonderfully rich smoked salmon flavour here \( maybe my taste buds came upon a pocket of the salmon that had not thoroughly mixed with the cream cheese in any event , this product should have been labled as cream cheese and salmon mousee , because cream cheese is the first ingredient listed , and smoked salmon is the eighth ingredient listed , \( out of 17 ingredients \) , and spinach is the fourteenth \( this product was made in the usa , remember and if i remember correctly , ingredients here must be listed in descending order but does this br in size order apply to titles too \? if not , it should br br the smoked salmon mousse has , again , a very mild flavour it tastes very unsimilar to the ny type lox i had hoped it would here , the amount of cream cheese so overwhelms the amount of smoked salmion , that it almost tastes like exotically spiced , and flavoured , cream cheese ! br br the little black tubs , however , are definitely re usable of a size similar to restaurant trays for artificial sweetner , they are happily made of no 5 plastic according to an organic gardening article i read a while back , only no 5 , or no 6 plastic are safe to reuse so , these little black tubs can be used to hold sugar and artificial sweetener packets , stray coins , business cards , tea bags , or any other similar object \( s \) they can also be used as portion control containers , as they hold not too much , and not too little of any food including , \( for reference \) , about five rounded tablespoons of tuna spre br trays for br br vita foods , \( available in new york 's waldbaum 's supermarkets , and probably other areas as well , sells a someked salmon and cream cheese spread , at 8 ounces for under 3 ir does not have spinach , chives , eggs , tomato , or many of the other ingredients in this smoked salmon mousse , sold by gourmetfoodstore it comes in a white , round plastic tub as it has more smoked slamon in it , it tastes more like smoked salmon to me as it 's kind of inconvenient for me to go to a land based store , i certainly hope amazon will offer this vita product , and others , \( like their herring in wine sauce \) , soon otherwise , i 'll save up for , and load up on , this vita product when next i go to walbaum 's the 'smoked salmon and spinach mousse pate all natural , being reviewed here , does have more snob appeal , and does come with those nice little space saving black tubs but , unlike the vita smoked salmon and cream cheese spread , it has more smoked salmon taste and that , when all is said and done , in the end , the main thing that matters in foods , does n't it \? br br p s one more plus the gourmetfoodstore catalogue which is included with every pruchase is an education in gourmet food , all by itself did you know how many types of smoked salmon there are \? how many types of caviar \? whether you buy anything \( else \) from gourmetfoodstore , this catalogue is not only mouth watering but very educational ! made on fine slick paper , and filled with beautiful cloured photos , \( and also high gourmet food prices \) , it is a gourmet catalogue in more ways than one ! thanks , gourmetfoodstore ! br br one more minus sadly , my food came packed in peanuts no not the edible type of peanuts the styrofoam type of peanuts ! it 's impossible to open any package packed in styrofoam peanuts , without getting at least some of these innocuous looking , but incredibly annoying little pieces of styrofoam , all over your floor ! gourmetfoodstore is not the only manufacturer seller who does this of course but one would think , with the wonderful , \( and espensive \) gourmet products they sell , that this up market marketer would pack their food with something less annoying to the customer \? of course , there is the tiny advantage in having something packed in peanuts one gets forced excercise picking up these small , but aggravating , strofoam peace of mind destroyers , off the br floor ok a few calories are used in this way , and , if you are female , you can imagine yourself to be ruth , \( from the bible \) , doing some gleaning however , i prefer to have my fantasies when i desire to have them , and to excercise when i decide to excercise , and not have these things suddenly and unexpexctedly forced upon me when opening up a package especially from such a luxury goods emporium as gourmetfoodstore truly is perhaps a 1 charge for having one 's goods not to be packed in peanuts might be applied \? \( please do n't make it more than 1 ! \) bubble wrap and similar plastic space fillers are so appreciated by customer ! and less aggravation leads to less buying of calmatives and pain relievers possibly allowing for more money to be spent at gourmetfoodstore ! please consider these suggestions for happier custumers , dear gourmetfoodstore thanks ! . 
this is what i consider to be true ginger beer it tastes like very strong ginger ale it has a bite to it it is sweetend with refined sugar , not raw sugar , so it doesnt have that strange molases taste .

this product is great i have never tried any liquor filled chocolate candies chocolates but i got to say , these were a great little surprise i am not good at describing food or candy , but these were little bottle shapped chocolates that are filled with liquid , which is nicely mixed with liquor some of these were stronger than others in a sense that some of them you can really feel instantly , while others you only taste chocolate br br i shared these with my friends and they seem really happy when they tried it there are four different chocolates i would definitely recommend this to everybody you just have to be careful , these chocolates have liquor in them so use at caution great little gift for myself \) .

the liquor filled chocolates arrived in perfect condition and were securely but attractively packaged i am unable to comment on the flavor as they were purchased for a gift the secure packaging prevented me from sampling the various flavors . 
i got these for my boyfriend for christmas they are a bit smaller then what i figured they would be from the box , i havent given them to him yet of course but i am sure we will have fun trying them the box came two day earlier then what amazon said they would come which is nice \) . 
fast shipping , items were packaged nicely and are as described also , very tasty \) highly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy . 
this is real stevia extract without any additives most of the companies that claim to be selling stevia are really selling stevia extract combined with other things , like fiber or artificial sweeteners , but this is the real deal it 's extremely sweet , which means you only have to use a small amount at a time , and you should melt it with hot water if you plan to put it in a cold drink stevia also tastes a little different \( some describe it as tasting like licorice , but i never thought so \) i suggest starting with the smallest amount and then upping the quantity until you find a level of sweetness that tastes good to you because of stomach problems , this is the only sweetener i use , and i like it very much i highly recommend it . 
sweet leaf stevia extract is powdered , pure stevia there are supposedly 400 servings \( 1 40th of a teaspoon \) in a 4 ounce container , so it works out to be a fairly inexpensive natural , non sugar sweetener and dietary supplement less than 2 cents per serving and 1 5 cents per serving with subscribe and save though it will take you a long time to use up one container , let alone four this extract has the sweetness of 300 360 times that of sugar , is a kosher product , and it contains no additives also the 4 ounce container is fairly small and has a shaker top , so it is easy to carry with you and use if you are away from home you could even attach a very small spoon with a rubber band to the container if you wanted to be even more precise with your serving sizes i started out using this in tea and i am now using it in my coffee as well it mixes fairly well in hot drinks it 's easy to get used to the flavor in tea , but may take you some time in coffee i think that it 's worth it to take the time to get used to the taste the end result is that for every teaspoon of sugar or serving of artificial sweetener that you ingest in your coffee or tea during the day , you will be substituting a dietary supplement that has been shown to be healthy to your gums and in some studies to lower high blood pressure every teaspoon of white granulated sugar has 4 grams of carbohydrates , 4 grams of sugar and 15 calories if you normally have 5 teaspoons of sugar during the day in your hot drinks , you would be saving 75 calories per day a good portion of the recommended 100 calorie per day reduction to help with long term weight loss the flavor of this pure extract compares very favorably with that of ground stevia leaf \( blehhh ! \) which if you add it to tea will just float on the surface also as compared with truvia or other stevia plus other sweetener products , it is considerably less expensive and the taste is pure not multi layered if you want to enhance the flavor and it does n't conflict with your diet regimen , consider adding a squirt of honey or a dash of table sugar to your beverage i am looking forward to perfecting a hot cocoa recipe chocolate and cocoa seem to mask flavors very effectively i am not sure how to use stevia for baking that will take some experimentation and most likely require combining stevia with other wholesome sweeteners br in all fairness , i have only tried truvia once in tea , and i found that it had an almost cooling effect on my tongue and considerably less sweetness than stevia many sweeteners come in single serving packets , and as a result they are considerably more expensive per serving why not start with a pure product \? . 
sweetleaf stevia extract is the best tasting sugar substitute i 've ever found , either for beverages or for cooking but it 's very concentrated , so it takes a bit of experimentation to get it to taste good but after you 've found the amount you like best , it is absolutely fabulous it even has a nice slight aftertaste \( that when adjusted properly \) , makes it taste even better than plain old sugar br br another drawback is that it does n't mix easily into liquids , but with practice , that becomes no problem either it 's much better than another sweetleaf product steviaplus that 's supposed to mix more easily but steviaplus has a weird taste that 's not nearly as delicious as stevia extract it does n't mix that much better either br br i just wish amazon would always keep in stock the larger size 0 9oz stevia extract containers sometimes the small ones are all that 's available . 
this is my favorite form of stevia it 's highly concentrated , so one small bottle lasts a long time i have a container near me all the time at work and at home it 's also the best tasting stevia that i 've tried and sweetleaf is a good company and the price is great ! . 
i recieved my stevia a couple of weeks ago and it is excellent my only problem is that the four containers were little more than half way filled , but the total amount of stevia is sufficient and i 've been using it everyday and i have not used much br overall , for the price , it is excellent . 
only once before have i tasted a better chocolate covered coconut macaroon , and that was long ago and far away the dark chocolate is lucious and it 's very addicting . 
my 26 month year old spotted these on his own while shopping at the supermarket and i had to overlook the 8 59 for 3 oz bag and just be glad that was what he was asking for the amazon price is somewhat better but higher then just tomatoes actual website i only question why at this price is all the fruit not sourced from the usa \? i find that a bit hard to believe but i guess everyone has to make a living some of the fruit is from vietnam the crunch of the fruit satisfies when in the need for a snack the fact that he is getting used to a non sugar snack as a special treat hopefully will establish his appreciation for fruits in their natural state the 3oz bag does have a lot in it more then i would have thought before buying . 
these are very handy when fresh fruit is n't available i bought them for my 16 month old and i to enjoy , however they are a little too crunchy and sour for her to eat straight from the bag , maybe some of other the other dried just fruit varieties are less tart overall they are nice to have on hand , they lose some of their tartness when stirred in cereal or yogurt also good for baking . 
they made a great impression on our family members great to celebrate the birth of our second child the chocolate was very tasty , and believe me i know chocolate \) . 
i bought these cigars and some bubble gum ones everybody loved the chocolate ones not so much the bubble gum ones besides having a nice presentation , people said the chocolate was actually really good ! ! ! i 'd buy these over the bubble gum ones again br br the only thing i wished was if they gave you more than just 24 too bad there was not a 'jumbo' pack because these cigars went fast ! . 
i used to live in winchester , ky as a kid i was actually born and raised there , but moved to montana in my early 20 's i moved back to lexington , ky a while ago and can enjoy this anytime now i'm very fortunate in that aspect , but out west it was so hard to be w o ca n't say enough about how good this product is very good for mixing w some good old shine or bourbon it 's a ginger ale , but nothing like your typical variety br br give it a try and see for yourself ! ! ! . 
ale 8 is the best thing about kentucky ! it far exceeds any other ginger ale product on the market both because of the delicious taste and because unlike most other ginger ale drinks it includes caffeine for that extra shot of energy . 
vanilla beans typically run 6 10 dollars for two at major supermarkets those prices make me reluctant to use them in most dishes that call for them , and instead i use vanilla bean paste \( williams and sonoma sells a very good product \) but these beans are such a good deal \( less than a fifth the supermarket price \) that now i'm willing to use them with almost reckless abandon vanilla beans really do provide superior flavor to things like rice pudding and custards and vanilla ice cream , a more complex , more luxurious flavor than vanilla extract does these beans arrived fresh , fragrant , and tightly bagged they 're madagascar vanilla beans , considered by some cognoscenti to be inferior to tahitian beans , but not being one of the cognoscenti , i ca n't detect much difference at all this product has made me a fan of internet grocery shopping . 
vanilla beans in our area cost 6 for one and up to 11 for two i like to make my own vanilla extract and i also like vanilla flavored sugar which requires whole beans i probably have a lifetime supply of vanilla beans now , but with amazon 's excellent price on this item , i can use them freely and order again if i need to thanks amazon ! . 
i purchased a cuisinart electric ice cream maker a href http www amazon com gp product b00000jgrt cuisinart ice 20 automatic 1 1 2 quart ice cream maker , white a this summer as well as a couple of great recipe books \( the perfect scoop by david libovitz , and the old fashioned ice cream cookbook by joyce deuker \) most of the recipes in each book call for vanilla beans \( in fact , almost insist on them ! \) have you priced them recently \? yikes so i turned to my trusty amazon com site , searched for vanilla beans and found these i could not be more pleased they are moist , flexible and have a very nice flavor i particularly like that they come in packages of two , so the remainder stay fresh who knew vanilla beans were n't crunchy ! after i have soaked the ice cream mixture , i dry the bean and put it in a jar with sugar so next time i see a recipe for vanilla sugar , i wo n't have to scramble i highly recommed this product . 
this is a good deal on whole vanilla beans , which i mostly use for making my own extract with everclear br br i stick them in the freezer to preserve , so it 's worthwhile buying so many at once and getting the bulk deal on these . 
great product for the price only negative would be the packaging since i keep mine in the freezer a single package of 24 or 30 or whatever would be sufficient i make chocaluah , a coffee chocolate liquor for adult use as a syrup over ice cream these beans add additional depth to the flavor of the sauce . 
purchased for making homemade vanilla ice cream slightly smaller beans than expected , but overall flavor and price outweighs expensive local bought beans . 
nice alternative if you ca n't find them locally great gift for the avid cook . 
i have a small gourmet catering business and have a couple of dessert items i use vanilla beans for one recipe calls for 3 full vanilla beans for each recipe ! one can image how expensive that would be at 4 6 per bean ! this melissa 's box was an incredible buy at just over 1 per bean the beans are supple and their flavor is very good as another reviewer mentioned , they are not the most coveted bean but for most purposes they are excellent ! i highly recommend this purchase for anyone who uses a lot of vanilla beans or who can find someone to share them with i do n't know how long they will remain fresh because i have n't had that issue , but as quickly as i use them , i do n't expect to this is a tremendous value ! ! . 
top grade tahitian vanilla beans , these are about three times bigger than the regular tahitian beans br excellent quality , incredible aroma and flavor highly recommended . 
i bought the navitas naturals chia seeds they are great i put them in a shaker bottle i use them on sweet potatoes , in salads and coleslaw and just learned that they can replace half of the fat in baking at first i did n't know if it was lowering my blood glucose or if it was something else but i confirmed it the other day i had stopped using the seeds and my morning blood glucose shot up to the 140 's i decided to start using the seeds again and within a few days my blood sugars dropped to the 120 's and the only thing i changed in my diet was the addition of chia seeds i love them i have n't made the gel yet i have only used them raw and they are like eating poppy seeds which i love hope this will help other diabetics navitas is a quality product and is very reasonably priced i will definitely continue to buy them . 
when i found out i was pregnant with my first child , i read in a baby magazine about the wonderful health benefits of chia seeds they are packed with omega 3 fatty acids , and because healthy brain function is nurtured by omega 3 fatty acids , i wanted to supplement my diet with something other than fish oil pills that can pack a fairly unpleasant aftertaste br these seeds are so tiny , and so flavorless , that you can mix them into cereal , or even juice , without ever realizing you have consumed them i have also found that adding these seeds to my breakfast keeps me fuller longer br chia seeds are more convenient than flax seeds , and a pound of them , costing around 12 \( depending on the seller \) , lasts a few months br if you want to avoid the potential unpleasantness of fish oil supplements , chia seeds are a great alternative , and for new or expecting mothers , they are a great way to ensure your baby is getting what s he needs for optimum brain health and development br lastly , you do not have to be considering motherhood to consider adding chia to your diet it is a wonderful , all natural supplement that is perfectly painless \( in both taste and cost \) to undertake br who would have thought that the seeds responsible for the \( infamous \) chia pet would offer so much more than a gawdy table ornament \? br highly recommended . 
for health reasons , i try to eat highly nutritious low carb foods i love tapioca but it 's 100 carbs with no nutritional value i was introduced to chia seeds and it is a highly nutritious low carb food but it is also a fun food it absorbs 12x its weight in liquids and puffs up and reminds me of tapioca with a strawberry seed inside \( and that 's what it tastes feels like \) another one of my favorites is the mexican drink called chia fresca , which is basically soaked chia seeds in lemonade you have to experience it yourself to know why it 's so popular one lb added to liquid will create 10 14 of highly nutritious food br br chia seeds \( best known for the chia pet \) are high in protein , 5x the calcium of milk and high in omega 3 oils chia seeds are seeds of an herb and are grown in mexico , south central america and were the food of the aztecs br br i would think you could make faux tapioca pudding with just coconut milk , chia seeds sweetener , but i do n't know how well the chia would absorb the coconut milk since it 's so fatty \( can of coconut milk , 1 4 cup chia seeds sweetener to taste \) i make it with 2 cups of water , 4 scoops of whey protein , then i soak one cup of chia seeds in this and when it has plumped up , i add 2 cans of coconut milk and sweetener sometimes i cream a package of cream cheese into a can of pumpkin , cinnamon and add that for more nutrition for a pumpkin pie tapioca pudding . 
chia seeds are a great , healthy food to add to your diet i make chia gel by mixing them with water \( 1 2 c per tablespoon of seeds \) , then stir the gel into yogurt , oatmeal , smoothies it 's flavorless and the seeds have a pleasant crunch this brand is high quality and i would n't hesitate to recommend it . 
these seeds are perfect for tossing into yogurt or smoothie but you must consume quickly the seeds draw moisture quickly causing them to swell you will be picking them from your teeth for days if you do not drink with a staw i have taken them straight from a spoon and washed them down with a glass of water before my light lunch and they really do give a feeling of fullness do to a severe sensitivity to caffeine and any sort of stimulus , i wanted to try something natural that would not raise my pulse , quicken my mvp heart and just not make me overall jittery these do the trick when i drink a meal replacement drink , i still feel hollow inside and want to snack by adding a full , rounded table spoon of seeds after a few minutes , i feel nice and full these can be tossed into a powdered drink , a canned ready to go drink \( milkshake type \) and even into a vitamin water but believe me when i say , you must consume quickly or you will need a spoon , they turn into a jello consistency quick which actually is not bad either you can bulk up a 100 calorie pudding snack by stirring in a teaspoon or so many ways to get creative with the chia seeds enjoy ! . 
nutritional benefits of chia seeds are incredible here are a few to start br br according to studies , chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids \( linolenic and linoleic \) of all crops chia seeds contain 60 omega 3 fatty acids br br the protein content of chia is higher that other nutritional grains unlike other grains , it is a complete protein , meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids about 19 to 23 of chia seeds weight is protein br br chia seeds are high in fiber , a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy br br chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health br br chia seeds are rich in calcium , about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of calcium , as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk br br chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana br br chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries br br regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of chia seeds , it also tastes very good my girlfriend and i make a big pot of steel cut oatmeal at night \( the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight \) , put in a good helping of chia seeds , and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it feel free to add a little cinnamon , peanut butter , fruit , or your own oatmeal favorite additions br br there are many other recipes for eating chia , but oatmeal is my personal favorite i started eating chia last year after reading the ny times bestseller 'born to run' about how a tribe of mexicans that eat chia will drink beer , smoke tobacco , and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days one of the primary contributors to the tribal mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient rich chia seeds i have n't put in 500 miles but after previously failing to finish a 26 mile marathon without chia in my diet , i added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26 mile marathon ! could the chia seeds have helped \? i think so i certainly had more energy and my joints felt better my second attempt at a marathon when on the chia br br i started out paying an arm and a leg at whole foods for navitas naturals chia seeds , but have since started buying it on amazon for a fraction of the price buy some chia seeds and make a delicious bowl of oatmeal for one of the healthiest breakfasts possible . 
i make chia gel with this and add a large spoonful to my yogurt and fruit in the morning i tried to make cookies with the gel and that was a failure ! great for subbing in sauces to add bulk without fat easy to sprinkle on top of any food product too since they have virtually no taste very versatile and easy to eat . 
chia seeds are an amazing nutritional powerhouse and to me , they do n't even really taste like anything \( which is a positive no funky taste here \) ! they are great sprinkled on salads , added to a smoothie , used to make raw vegan pudding , etc its uses are many ! br br also i wanted to add that this is a really good price my co op charges almost 20 lb for chia seeds , and amazon has them for just over 13 ! . 
i just started eating these recently after hearing about all of their positive qualities and the omega 3 bit i was expecting to take a spoonful and swallow it like medication instead i decided to mix it into my strawberry kefir i love the way the little seeds swell up and give the kefir a little bit of a chewy texture it reminds me of those asian drink places that add the tapioca or lychee pieces to fruit smoothies they are great be aware though after you eat these that they are little black seeds and they seem to love to stick between your teeth i look like some kind of nasty old redneck with chewing tobacco all over my mouth if i do n't floss after eating them br br this bag is a nice size and i think it will last a while worth the price . 
i do n't know if chia seeds are really a super food , but this brand seems to be very good quality i 've bought other kinds , and these look better and since i only eat them sprinkled on my morning cereal , it 's not that expensive to buy this higher priced brand . 
seeds are a staple in my household , i always have flax for baking , hemp seeds for snacking , and chia for added protein , iron , calcium , and omega 3s in my daily morning smoothies i know you can add chia seeds to salads , but i do n't personally prefer the taste they do n't really have any taste , so they are n't bad , just not something i would personally eat a spoonful of chia seeds are an important to my daily routine because they have a decent amount of iron and do n't hurt my stomach i'm very sensitive to iron supplements , and do n't eat meat , chia seeds is something my doctor recommended i try to add to my diet , and he and i are both glad i did navitas naturals makes excellent products , and i have purchased many of their brand items in my freezer right now is their raw maca powder , cacao nibs , flax seeds , mulberries , acai powder , wheatgrass , and goji berries i am always impressed with the freshness and quality i have not noticed any processing remnants in their products , and they always arrive fresh from amazon , who seems to have a much better turnaround time than my local whole foods and the price is unbeatable my favorite smoothie is 1 cup of almond milk , 1 scoop of wheat grass or amazing grass , a huge spoon of whatever nut butter is in freshly made , 1 teaspoon chia seeds , 1 tablespoon hemp seeds or hemp protein powder , 1 tablespoon cacao nibs , two huge handfuls of spinach , a banana , and ice this tides me over from 6 am until i eat lunch around 1 \( the chia contribute a lot , since they gel up when in contact with liquid , they leave you feeling fuller for longer \) i 'd prefer to give 4 5 stars for nutritional benefits and ease of incorporation , but like i said , the taste is lacking it is not nutty , despite their claims it 's really a non flavor and wish they did n't lead you to believe most people would want to just snack on these as they are . 
chia seeds are a versatile and amazing food these seeds from navitas naturals br br 1 \) provide a very easy way get omega fatty acids your body cannot make omega 3 fatty acids on its own and they are essential to cognitive health br br 2 \) provide an easy way to get fiber not only does fiber help you feel fuller it can promote digestive regularity br br 3 \) are easily incorporated into many foods you eat on a regular basis chia seeds can be placed in oatmeal and smoothies because they have a rather mild taste , you can even use them as sprinkles on a dessert i 've made a vanilla tapioca pudding with them i also add them to salads because chia seeds eventually turn into a gel if left in a liquid for a period of time , you can use them to thicken gravies br br 4 \) are vegan \( and therefore vegetarian \) fish is how most individuals incorporate omega fatty acids in their diet these seeds are fish free br br 5 \) provide energy can be a great supplement to take before intense workouts or on days when you are feeling sluggish let these seeds soak in some juice or low calorie coconut milk \( like so delicious \) to help propel you through the rest of your day br br 6 \) come in a bag that is resealable you do n't have to struggle to close the bag it opens easily and closes just as easily . 
i would buy chia seeds at costco instead it 's 2 pounds for 7 99 and i use them in smoothies , over salads , and lately , i mix them in with chocolate almond milk for amazing pudding in 3 hours chilled ! . 
i could n't wait to get my package of these little seeds because of the health benefit they provide and plus i am trying to lose some weight i 've only tried them once but they made a lovely pudding br 1 2 cup coconut milk br 2 tsbp chia seeds br 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder \( i used amazing grass chocolate powder 'cause it 's all i had \) br 1 tablespoon cinnamon br 1 tablespoon honey br br mix well in a container or small bowl , making sure to incorporate the cocoa powder br cover and place on a counter for about 30 minutes , stirring a few times br br it will turn into a wonderful gelatin esque yummy dessert ! . 
i 've been consuming about 1 tablespoon twice per day , soaked for at least 15 minutes , followed by an equal amount of water they help me feel more full throughout the day and thus i am able to consume less calories the additional protein and fiber is an added bonus . 
i started adding chia seeds to my diet about 18 months ago i have tried various brands and like the navitas naturals brand the best of the 4 or 5 brands i have tried not sure if the organic promises they provide are absolutely true , but as a consumer of several navitas naturals products i certainly hope so in any event , it beats buying some of the bulk chia seeds i have found at local stores with little or no explanation of where the seeds really come from br br in all , i find chia seeds rather tasteless the joy in eating them , if there is any , is in the texture crunch they provide some other brands had what i assume was foreign matter , which made the texture uneven or , worse , hard like having little rocks in the mix br br my motivation for adding them to my diet was to increase my omega 3 intake from plant sources and add more fiber as well i have noticed improvement in my overall health since eating them , but i ca n't say for sure if chia played any role in that because i changed my diet in many other ways and greatly increased my work out schedule just to be safe , i'm going to continue eating chia every morning and adding it as often as possible for other meals throughout the day br br as a very happy customer , i plan on continuing my subscription to navitas naturals chia seeds for a long time . 
these are much better quality than the cheaper seeds i bought on another site originally , i had them on a six month subscription \( a pound twice a year \) but i 've changed it to monthly . 
there are so many miracle health products out there it 's hard to know what 's for real but enough people have said good things about these seeds that i decided to jump on the chia seed bandwagon and order up a bag br br health benefits br extremely high concentration of omega 3 acids \( more than salmon \) br complete protein ! what does that mean \? i had to look it up too \) it means chia seeds contain all the essential amino acids your body needs so you could just eat nothing but chia seeds and survive most veggies do n't have that , meaning you need to mix and match various plant sources to get everything all the things your body ca n't synthesize on its own 1 serving \( 10g 1 tbsp \) 2g protein higher than most other grains and seeds other plant sources with complete protein quinoa , soybean , buckwheat hempseed br good source of fibre potassium calcium br 3x the iron than spinach br low in cholesterol sodium br does n't have drawbacks like flaxseed does with being a laxative and does n't have estrogen like effects br br uses taste br chia seeds taste pretty good ! rather , there 's no strong taste the way sesame does , so you just have more of a crunchy texture if you eat them dry , or a thicker jelly like texture if you soak them in water for a little bit br br ideas for use in a salad , added to smoothies , in a breakfast granola or yogurt , in oatmeal , used as an egg replacement in baked goods , on sushi , to make iskiate \( chia fresca \) a tarahumara energy drink , or just straight up have a spoonful i recently made pancakes and threw in a few tablespoons and it worked out great br br one thing to note is these seeds can stick in your teeth , so be sure to do a quick mirror check after eating them \) br br this brand br i have n't bought any other brand of chia seeds , but this one works so why switch \? seeds tasted fresh when i opened the package and stayed fresh during the 2 months it took me to go through my bag bag is resealable , price on amazon was better than in stores a good buy br br overall i'm feeling pretty good about eating chia seeds instead of cupcakes although that has me thinking next kitchen experiment lemon chia cupcakes ! bye bye poppy seeds ! . 
i 've heard a bunch of great things about chia seeds i love the texture it adds to juices i honestly have n't felt much benefit form eating the seeds in terms of strength , endurance , etc but it has helped in cleaning out my system and keeping health on my mind , but i love the ritual of mixing something healthy and natural in my juices and i love the texture . 
when a friend of mine recommended i tried chia seeds i though she was crazy , i mean they 're chia seeds enough said anyway , i tried them because i 'll try just about anything if someone tells me it 's good for me and i 'll like it , and as it turns out it is both of those things these little seeds are about the size of sesame seeds , maybe a little smaller , and have a very mild nutty taste they can be added to just about anything and are packed with omega fats , fiber and a little protein they 've got fat , but not the bad french fries and cheeseburger kind , the good kind that your body uses to keep your heart and everything else healthy and by the way , these do n't have to be ground or chewed up \( like flax \) in order for your body to get all the goodies from them , you can just eat them the way they are . 
great for making tapioca like pudding with none of the carbs ! i like to make chia gel and add that to iced teas and smoothies the texture kind of reminds me of boba it is a good source of omega 3s , magnesium , and calcium also , the combination of fiber and fat slows digestion and blunts blood sugar spikes i will be buying this in bulk when i run out \) . 
a friend of mine has been touting the benefits of chia seeds for years , so i finally decided to give them a try i really like them br br i have n't tried making tapioca or pudding like some of the other reviewers have instead , i usually toss a tablespoon into my protein smoothies or into my granola greek yogurt goji berry mixture br br as others have mentioned , they do swell up after they 've been in liquid for awhile , but i 've found that as long as i drink my smoothie within 10 minutes or so of making it , it 's fine br br since adding chia seeds , goji berries , and soy lecithin into my diet last month , i 've noticed that my skin seems brighter and smoother , and i have more energy . 
i really enjoy adding these seeds to my smoothies they add a nice texture , just the right amount of crunch , and i think they taste like kiwi seeds i hear they are healthy too ! . 
great tasting , wholesome goodness at a fair price ! ! i put these little seeds on everything ! chia has a n excellent shelf life and navitas packages their product in a resealable bag to ensure freshness ! ! . 
i love chia seeds i got the info from watching dr oz , and thought i would try them in an attempt to eat healthier i love them in just about everything i use them in my oatmeal , and my fruit salad at lunch time i'm much fuller after using chia seeds and also have more energy bottom line is i remain feeling full much longer i also have better bowel movements important with the medications i 've been on for 15yrs it could be all in my mind , but i feel better since starting the chia seeds i 'd be a great commercial for these folks ! now i just need to get them in a bigger size ! \) . 
these tiny seeds really work ! other than getting stuck in my teeth , they keep me full , offer additional fiber , and have little to no taste ! and i received my order super fast ! great product and dealer ! . 
i really liked this product and am sad that i ca n't get it with subscribe and save anymore why not \? \( . 
read one of the chia books out there this really is a super food br br the only down side is the price gouging here on amazon chia can now be found in many grocery stores in the bulk bins for around 9 50 lb 20 bag here is ridiculous . 
i add chia seeds to my morning shake for breakfast and i am in love with them they taste great almost like tiny bobas but better this particular bag last a long time considering i consume them daily they are also cheaper than most stores , def recommend this product . 
i 'd never tried chia seeds before , but i'm trying to be more health conscious , so i ordered this with the intent to put them in my overnight oatmeal they 're great ! a little goes a long , long way i had no problems with bloating , they taste like nothing , and they pack a nutritional wallop i 've since added them to quinoa and couscous , and have a bread recipe i'm planning to try great value i 'll buy them again . 
i am in chia heaven i have been wanting to try chia since reading about its versatility and health benefits but i waited , put off by the steep , in market , price tag navitas naturals chia seeds , purchased via amazon , are half the price of the in store product i was worried about how long it would take for them to arrive and also about how fresh they would be since seeds can spoil and become rancid the product arrived promplty , within 2 mailing days and was fresh and delicious i have since been using it in smoothies in place of flax seed , and creating very nutritious desert blends they have a texture similar to tapioca \( but smaller \) when mixed with liquid i am a fan and would encourage you if you are interested in supplementing your diet with chia seeds to look up recipes on line and experiment do your pocket book a favor though , and skip the super market , or health food store for chia seeds the mark up is high purchase navitas naturals chia seeds online . 
i'm all about the natural superfoods , so it 's no surprise i got this not only does it make you feel fuller for longer , it is also a natural thickener when my hummus looked a bit runny , i just added some chia to it and it thickened up really well . 
these are great , only wish i had tried them earlier i had originally put off purchasing these thinking i would n't use them , but i was wrong i use these daily , in oatmeal , yogurt , on top of salad , mixed into soup they taste like whatever you mix them with and really help you feel full longer ! highly recommend ! . 
i love adding chia seeds to my oatmeal or yogurt it makes the food more filling and does n't affect flavor . 
love this stuff ! i make my own granola and add it in will definitely buy again . 
i got this here last week , its yummy br i soak some in juice overnight and put it in smoothies br or mix it with yogurt . 
learning that we americans have an imbalance of omega3 vs omega6 , i was glad to find something to correct the imbalance without putting in too much effort chia does n't taste like anything just looks like mini dinosaur eggs ! i use two tablespoons of chia in a large cup of water with matcha and a little bit of crystal light it 's fun to drink it when the seeds bloat like tomato seeds ! . 
i love eating chia seeds and they are so filling i put them in my oatmeal everyday they help me with my digestive system ! . 
people that research this product knows that is good to lower your cholesterol and is a great food for busy people that can have just juice for breakfast the seller was extra nice and took care of me cause my package got lost in the mail and now i finally got it \) br thanks guys ! ! ! . 
navitas naturals chia seed have become a favorite it was easy to set up the next delivery date to enjoy these healthy seeds i am sad amazon has removed them from the auto ship program i will continue to buy them for as long as they are available for their health benefits . 
i like the taste and texture over all i 'd put it in my oatmeal every morning as far as the energy it 's supposed to give , i'm not sure yet i also used it in stir fry instead of sesame seeds it 's a great product overall . 
i just found about chia seeds and i actually bought this bag so i could plant them the seeds are growing like weeds and i 've discovered that they are great in my foods also ! my husband put them in a tomato sauce to thicken it , i add a teaspoonful to my cereal , and a tablespoon to my lemonade they 're fun to eat and take on the flavor of what ever i'm making ! . 
came quickly and good value for the price product was fresh and of decent quality , i would order this again . 
if you put two teaspoons of chia seeds in a bowl of vanilla almond milk and let it sit for a couple of hours , it makes the seeds more bearable to eat . 
these are great in juice mix what i usually do is mix a tablespoon or two in a glass with half way filled water stir continuously for the next minute or two \( this is to keep the seed separated so they do n't stick together in small chunks , do this and they will float in the drink mix \) , then fill up the glass with your prefer choice of juice or organic juice \( guava , prune , coconut , etc \) , stir in a tiny bit of a href http www amazon com gp product b00014j2uo kal pure stevia extract powder , 3 oz powder a let the drink sit for at least 15 minutes \( remember to stir it every minute so that the gel coat on those seeds are formed evenly and they will float \) drop in a cube or two of ice when ready to serve you 'll be amazed ! . 
the chia seeds are fresh , shiny and clean it is easy to use them and add to various recipes because you hardly see or taste them you just know they are there to make you healthier ! . 
i got this product because i used to buy chia water in kreation cafe , and they sell one bottle for like 6 this little bag can make at least c hundred of these bottles , if not much more what a great saving ! i make a bottle \( or two \) of chia water , add agave syrup and stevia to it and slowly drink throughout the day these seeds have so many benefits ! and i love the smooth sensation of them on my tongue it 's a fun water , and i am buying more for now i have been using it for about 2 weeks , and my bag is still almost fool . 
i absolutely love these navitas naturals chia seeds i have been using them in and on various meals for over a year now , and i now rely on them so much that i finally decided to subscribe to ordering them through amazon i cook for myself and one other person , use these on at least one meal per day \( helps digestion and provides key nutrients for my vegetarian diet ! \) and i usually need a new bag every other month these are just like poppy seeds in texture and size , and i find them perfect for sprinkling on salads , soups and pasta dishes but honestly , they 're excellent in anything for added texture and nutrients ! . 
muy buen producto , el cierre del empaque es fant aacute stico adem aacute s de todos los beneficios que tiene como antioxidante br lo recomiendo ampliamente br good product . 
okay so the doctor did n't 'order' these but i read about a lot of their benefits and love adding them to smoothies etc the product came fresh and is definitely a good buy will be ordering again ! . 
it was always hard for me to buy this product locally perhaps because it 's so popular ! i find these little chia seeds a good way to sneak in some extra nutrition and add some fill to my smoothies \( otherwise all fruit water or oj \) i 've snuck them into other things too oatmeal , salad , soups if you add it to something wet , just note that the tiny seeds \( think poppy seeds \) will swell and turn a bit gummy this is n't a big deal , but it changed the taste of my absolute favorite soup so i do n't think i 'll try it in that one again \( lentil \) i drink my smoothies quick , so i add these as the last step , and i do n't think they have much time to swell the seeds themselves are pretty tasteless to me , just little black dots warning they will stick in your teeth ! seriously these are an at home item only when i can brush my teeth or swish well after do n't try them at work , or before a big meeting , etc overall , i do n't think they have changed my world but a good little supplement boost , and amazon had them easy to get , and a great price compared to my local market i took off a star because of the tooth concerns but otherwise i was n't expecting magic they met my expectations and came fresh and well packaged . 
title says it all , a excellent quality product and excellent service at a fair price product came ahead of time and as expected . 
this is the first time i ordered these and they blend right into my smoothies ! they seem a good quality and a decent price ! . 
i add these chia seeds to my scottish oatmeal nutritious and yummy br br do i have more energy \? yes and i am attributing it to the chia seeds . 
i tried the chia seeds because i was told they are a great source of fiber and have all the omegas in them i am very pleased with the product and they give me enery would highly recommend them to anyone . 
i am not much on stuff like this , but having some issued that i think this item will take care of , i got some here local shops did not carry it , prices at flea markets and food shops were just to high the price from amazon was very good br i no longer have need of this item but if the condition returns so will i , here ! . 
i highly recommend the hearty satisfying chia seeds , for a snack or a meal , packed with protein and fiber i often add it to waffles and other recipes ! . 
i add this to my morning steel cut oats and its awesome ! a little in my smoothie is really good and i also put this in my banana bran muffin recipe too ! . 
we use these in smoothies , pancakes , waffles and even our vegan burger patties you do n't notice them , but they add a great consistency and texture and it also helps as a binding agent in place of eggs . 
i'm very happy with this product it was less expensive here than at my local whole foods and having purchased other navitas items , i can say that it is quickly becoming a favorite brand . 
i add a teaspoon to my protein powder for additional nutrition and because they have no flavor the chocolate taste is not affected plus chia seeds thicken my concoction . 
i just love these seeds , got them second time and use them more often they gel way faster and better than flax seeds and you can substitute these in many dishes \( i am vegan and i am allergic to dairy products \) love the quality of this product ! . 
i really like them , i add them to my smoothies for lunch and it makes them more filling and i like the flavor ! . 
where to start on this one these little seeds had been on my wishlist for at least three months before i actually bought them i am a vegan and take my nutrition very seriously all the hype about what a 'superfood' chia seeds were i figured this was just the next new thing i did some research , looked at the nutritional benefits and facts and figured if i hated them it would n't be too long until i finished the pouch i make cream of wheat in the morning with a tablespoon of flaxseeds , one cup of almond milk , one cup water , and 4 tablespoons of a nut mixture i made of raw almonds , cashews , walnuts , dried blueberries , cranberries and golden raisins i purposely make it loose so i feel fuller longer the chia seeds let me keep the volume of breakfast without adding too many calories now my cream of wheat is not so soup like and it has extra fiber protein and the good fats i am pleased with this product and am going to contiune to use it . 
tried one bag to test out and liked them enough to order three more bags i make eskate \( sp \? \) using chia , water , and lime juice and i also have been putting them into homemade peanutbutter and oatmeal energy bars ca n't speak to this brand vs other brands as this is the only brand i have tried i can say that i was pleased enough to stick with this brand for the re order . 
these may last forever at 1t every day in my morning shake since i'm having trouble finding recipes for other ways to use these seeds , but they will keep \( in a sealed plastic container \) . 
if you love bbq oysters , this is the original west coast bbq sauce ! after 30 years , it 's nice to be able to buy this outside of pt reyes . 
i bought the wilton cookies and cream brownie crunch for decorating cake balls , and it was a hit i ca n't wait to try it on top of brownies yum ! . 
earth mama angel baby organic heartburn tea did not cure my heartburn in fact , i'm currently 29 weeks' pregnant , and have tried \( with my doctor 's approval \) tums , pepcid \( famotidine \) , papaya enzymes , pathetically bland food and loads of vanilla ice cream , but nothing has singlehandedly cured my heartburn br br however , this tea does help , depending on the type and severity of the heartburn marshmallow , the useful ingredient , works by helping to coat your stomach and digestive tract when one of my friends recommended this tea to me , she explained , it wo n't stop the acid from being produced , or stop it from coming up , but it will make the whole experience less painful and nasty i could n't agree more subsequently , it 's not as effective for combating the i should n't have eaten that salsa type of heartburn , but is pretty useful for the 2 am lying in bed without gravity to help keep food down it just wo n't stay down type of heartburn in fact , pair the earth mama tea with sleeping in a recliner , and the 2 am burn is no longer one of my concerns br br the taste of the tea is sort of grassy with a bit of mint i do n't find it too bitter to drink without a sweetener my best tip for making the tea work well is to start drinking it before the heartburn becomes a problem i usually brew a large cup to have with my dinner , then reserve a few mouthfuls' worth of the tea to sip during the night when i wake up the taste is fine when the tea is cold , and i find it no less effective br br overall , i recommend earth mama angel baby organic heartburn tea . 
i am only 12 weeks pregnant and had the worst case of heartburn indigestion i was sick dawn till dusk my mom found this tea and the first day i drank 3 cups and it eased my symptoms a bit , but continued using it day 2 no heartburn indigestion at all ! i am on day 4 and still going strong and feeling better than ever ! thank god for moms and this tea ! . 
wow ! i did n't expect that this would work last night , but it did ! i had the worst case of heartburn at 10 weeks along , and after not being able to eat dinner and 4 tums , it was n't getting any better my best friend just bought me the earth mama angel baby tea sampler the other day and i had a lightbulb moment , remembering the heartburn tea was in there i figured it was worth a shot , not having eaten dinner and feeling nauseous and miserable within a half an hour , the tea helped me to let out a couple of good burps and the hearburn finally eased i'm not usually so excited about something to go out and write a review , but am hoping this might help some other mamas 2 be in need as well i am putting in an order to get some more of this today will be good to have a box on hand at home and at work the taste is very nice too , so i am beyond pleased ! . 
we first had these sardines in st petersburg , russia and they were the very best sardines i had ever tasted i returned home and lo and behold they had the same sardines at our local market the next time i looked the did n't carry them anymore so i looked online and found them through amazon at taylors market \( somehow they can get these sardines at the finnish store stockmens in st petersburg , but we are unable to get them in the united states \) my order will expire on march 27th and i still do n't have the sardines , but i reordered today through a different supplier at a much greater cost , but i hope i receive them this time they are yummy ! . 
our baby is very happy with his similac organic ready to drink formula br he is also very happy with the regular formula in the blue bottle , which we feed him when the organic is not available br br he did not really like the formula when we had to mix it from powder br he is ten months old now and he rarely spits up , always smiles and is the most content baby anybody has ever seen br br i attribute that to awesome parenting and not to the formula . 
i was looking for a formula to supplement my breastmilk for my twins \( i have never made enough \) i was given similac advanced in the hospital in the little two ounce bottles , so i started there when we ran out of the free samples , we tried to switch to the powdered similac advanced , it gave my girls horrible gas i did n't realize that the two might be different when we went back to pre mix to try to resolve the gas issue , i bough a couple of bottles of the organic to try out i felt like i would rather feed my children organic ingredients over conventional ones if all else was equal i also looked at the similac for gas and fussiness and sugar is the first ingredient um , no thanks i felt that the organic milk ingredients were closest to the ingredients in breastmilk \( what they get 3 out of 5 feedings a day \) , so i was happy when they took to it easily and without gas for the record , we have had zero problems with constipation if i have to feed formula \( which unfortunately i do for some of their feedings \) , i'm glad that i have this formula as an option ! . 
i am not a great milk producer and ha e had to supplement my last 4 children , with two i made my own , with the next i used the powder , not that i have my sixth baby i wanted something quick and easy but also organic i have been happy with this so far i do n't like using formula but i decided it was better than killing myself with constant pumping and stressing that i did not have enough ! br price was better than the store , i would love to see it on subscribe and save though . 
great product , our daughter loves this and has been gaining weight great we try to get as many organic foods as possible for us and our daughter this is one of the few options that are available in ready mix we do n't have much time in the morning or evening so this works great for us first we were mixing breast milk and similac advanced and she was doing great then we wanted to go to organic and moved to this when we were doing both breast milk and this we noticed she pooped far less , not a bad thing and never farther than 36 hours now she only drinks this formula and poops a few times a day and is growing great we started her on this at about 1 5 months a few ounces a day \( sometimes mixed with breast milk , and now she is 5 months old and eating about 32 ounces a day \( a regular little chubbers \) br br on a side note if you ever tasted breast milk , this tastes as close to that as any formula we tried some formulas are so nasty smelling and tasting its a wonder any baby eats them br br cheers ! . 
this is a good product and very high quality the majority of people who post on amazon \( and the internet \) are not medical providers and are not the least bit inclined in the area of sciences or infant nutrition there 's a large amount of misinformation out there and the misinformation is evident and propagated throughout the reviews for this formula as for this product specifically \( similac organic \) , it is the top echelon of quality with regard to consistency and nutritional value we 've had great success with this product and are very pleased overall as an adjunct to breastmilk abbott labs \( product maker \) is a very large research reagent laboratory for the medical sciences and they have very rigorous quality controls in place , published research , and they also provide reagents to the scientific research community \( exacting standards \) that said , i would be less inclined to trust some of the other small makers of formula \( ie other organic products suggested as better in these reviews especially the referenced small name organic powders \) all said and done , the components in all of the similac products are the highest quality and monitored with advanced scientific protocols and are well researched in published studies i 'd trust this brand similac , over the smaller , no names plain and simple keep in mind it 's what best suits your baby and with nascent developing gi tracts , all babies will experience some degree of gas and discomfort regardless of the formula or nutritional source \( even breastmilk \) it 's sad to see people in these reviews propagating misinformation as they are neither pediatricians physicians do your own research and best to avoid those with ulterior motives , as well as the misinformative reviews and internet blogs that are overly slanted or biased . 
i was never going to give my children formula after my first child was born i did not produce enough milk and had to supplement we tried all different types of formula from many name brands unfortunately he had adverse reactions to everything we tried , including soy products we finally tried organic similac this was by far the most expensive , so we started with the powder this stayed down he did n't have any reactions \( rashes , hives , throwing up , etc \) after a couple of months he began spitting up a little powdery substance \( guess we did n't mix well enough \) we then tried the premixed similac organic voila ! perfect no adverse reactions , he was happy healthy br br we 've had 2 more children both have also used the premixed organic similac neither of them have had an problem with the formula according to the doctor they are all very healthy children to me that is what 's most important \) . 
as far as i can tell , this is the only organic ready to feed formula on the us market \( earth 's best only comes in powder form \) it 's about time ! ! ! ! it 's cheaper on amazon than from the similac online store . 
i switched from similac advanced to organic when my daughter was 1 month old she is almost 5 months now , no problems at all ! she loves it ! . 
like the bad reviews say , the organic formula constipated our daughter however , by alternating every other feeding with regular \( non organic \) formula the problem was resolved i'm a believer that some organic is better than no organic we 've used this method for 2 months and our daughter is full , happy , and growing well br br i would recommend this if you are looking for an organic formula with milk as the first ingredient \( as opposed to rice in some of the others \) . 
i wanted to solely breastfeed but was unable to keep up and had to supplement formula i chose similac because they are a very reputable company and i had a ton of it from the hospital we have used both the powder and ready made and he likes both he got a little constipated at the beginning but has been on it now for 5 months and no problems i read some other reviews about sucrose well , sucrose is just sugar and all formula has sugar in it other companies just label it differently and since ths one is organic it has to contain a pure sugar as far as the hexane goes , i did my research , all formulas except one \( babys only \) use the hexane method babys only contains brown rice syrup that has been shown to have high levels of arsenic uh , no thanks also similac has been tested and found to have no hexane present in the product overall my baby is healthy and smart so i am very happy with this formula . 
i love the fact that i can get this delieved to my house with no delievy charge it is so hard to find organic formular . 
we have a 7 week old he had gas and constipation problems for the first 5 weeks we tried two different kinds of similac including for fussiness and gas and neither seemed to work we switched to the organic a few weeks ago and saw quick improvement i wish i could breast feed but i'm unable to , so for now this seems the best option especially since it was recommended we stick with a ready made formula for the gas problems br ive read a lot of the reviews and took into consideration the information about sucrose i plan on talking to the pediatrician and my midwife for additional information beyond the article written about it , especially since that is from 2008 i realize the concern and i am doing research on making my own formula so i know exactly whats in it and that its organic , but in the mean time baby l eats great with this , is healthy , and has fewer stomach problems it 's middle of the road when it comes to although amazn is one of the more expensive places ! ! ! target has the best price so for now it works and i recommend it ! ! .
