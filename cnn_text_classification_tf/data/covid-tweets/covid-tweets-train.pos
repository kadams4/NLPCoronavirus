Does anyone know if Las Vegas is open I'm pretty sure that the casinos are a breeding ground for the #COVID19
When I tried to alarm people around me because I saw how bad it was in China two months ago. They say: don’t worry that’s China. Now: WORSE than China in every aspect. Still 🤬 how everywhere else has extra months to prepare and now it’s pandemic. #COVID19 #COVID2019NL
It's already here. Trump can't waive #COVID19 away with another travel ban. Where are the test kits? #TrumpAddress
Friendly reminder to disinfect your phones and other handheld devices. #COVID19 #coronavirus
#COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #coronavirus I personally think that maybe all the affected countries should stop flights coming in and out of the country until they can contain this deadly virus 🦠
Many crucial moments have come and gone in the decision timelines of world leaders. As the mounting data suggests, most countries have responded with too little, too late. Perhaps it’s time for a data scientist as president. #CoronavirusPandemic #Wisdom #dreaming #COVID19
A Hollywood celebrity and a NBA player tested positive 😳😳 #CoronavirusOutbreak
If your home is on fire, do you complain about how it started or do everything in your power to put it out? #Covid19 #CoronaVirus
I am trying to not let this whole #CoronavirusPandemic get me riled up. But I will say this, it is ok to be concerned for the people in your community who are 65+ reach out to them, help them, be a good person &amp; wash your hands people!!!!! Ok thanks for listening to my Lilli Talk
I’m sadden to hear that Tom Hanks and his Wife gave contracted the #Covid_19 virus 🥺
It is the time to do more now so we can do less better later. #Covid_19 #covid19SA
So even if the flu is worse than #Covid_19 it’s still killing people today!? What kind of argument is this?
This pandemic is much bigger than politics, disagreements, business, sports, etc... Blessings &amp; love during these times #COVID19
Guys lot of countries are under lockdown. Its time we fill up our refrigerator with food, stock enough groceries and disinfectants for home. Shortly we are going to get 2 week work from home notice #coronavirusindia #pandemic #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus

Holy shit. No travel in or out from Europe for 30 days. Shit just got real homies #coronavirus #COVID19 #trumpspeech
Is money really more important than peoples lives? Surely the sooner everything is shut down the sooner #COVID19 is stopped. I’ve heard so many pompous medical professionals say we’re so much better prepared than in Italy. Really? #pillocks
They’ve found they Coronavirus can have strong symptoms in some, and hardly any in others. Some have none, but can still give it to others. Testing shouldn’t have to be a last resort at this point. #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus
#Trump should be preparing hospital beds instead of banning travel to #EU. 	American healthcare system will not be able to care for the sick	#WorstPresidentInHistory		#CoronavirusPandemic
300K people have been tested in China	200K people have been tested in South Korea	9K people in the US. Gross negligence by this administration and we have been failed yet again. #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID #pandemic #CancelEverything
Anyone that decides to travel at this time...is just fucking selfish.....YOUR ONE OF THE MAIN FUCKING REASONS CONVID-19 IS SPREADING!!!!!		#CANADA	#COVID19 	#TravelBan 	#travel

Holy COW. #BreakingNews All travel banned to &amp; from Europe. #TrumpAddress #COVID19 #Coronavirus
Reality Check: COVID-19 does not watch/read the news. So whatever spin or rose colored glasses are put on, it is a virus so it does not care. #CoronavirusPandemic #pandemic
It’s 2 am and I can’t sleep because I’m worried about the #CoronavirusPandemic

If #COVID19 was studied &amp; controlled back in Nov-Dec last year when the doctors 1st raised the issue instead of them being censored &amp; prosecuted, none of this would be happening.We are all suffering the damages caused by Chinese gov. #HumanRights #FreedomOfSpeech #CensorshipKills

BREAKING: Twitter orders all its employees to work from home.	#CoronaVirusUpdate #COVID #CoronavirusPandemic
the US is handling this #COVID19 so poorly
This day, and more broadly this period of time, are historic. This is an event that will be remembered for the rest of our lives and then some. #Coronavirus #COVID19
Wow...Tom Hanks &amp; Rita Wilson test positive #COVID19
Aware of the panic and all about the likely lockdown--It would do everyone good if we not only think of our own health, but also of the welfare of our families and communities. We might (unknowingly) spread the #COVID19, so please avoid travelling.
Virus carriers may not show symptoms of #Covid_19 for as long as 14 days, and in the meantime they’re potentially spreading germs. The bottom line is that this is such a new virus, there is just a lot we don’t yet know. I’d rather err on the side of caution to protect our public.
Be kind to one another, especially in the workplace. Every combination of constraints &amp; concerns will be encountered. Some people will need to WFH, and need support with that. Others' work necessitates being on-site, and they need support with that. Extend your empathy. #COVID19
Sports is done for awhile. Face it. And it stinks. #CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19
The #COVID19 cases in Italy is +12k and the active cases in mainland China is a little more or less than +15k ...		Italy is almost becoming the most infected country in ww
The USA is still taking a reactive approach the #COVID19 instead of a proactive approach.  Communities need to be tested immediately.  Containment should be implemented across the board, meaning the public needs to immediately take measures to stop community spread of the virus.
Deciding not to care for the elders? It seems unreal, a b horror movie. It breaks my heart. Can’t even wrap my head around it. #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #ItalyCoronavirus

Message to the general public: STOP BOOKING FLIGHTS AND TRAVELING. #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaOutbreak #coronavirus
Guys, we have to stop looking to our federal government for answers. There are none. If you can, stay home. Keep your kids home. Build your immunity. 		This is a great time to develop your hustle. #CoronavirusPandemic
All UNR classes moved online following our spring break. This is a good move by the university! Thankful to work for an employer who values us and our students, and recognizes this situation for what it is: an emergency. #COVID19 #UNR
right now with the #CoronavirusPandemic i ask you to check in on the ones most marginalized because they are the ones being affected 		* ALSO REMEMBER WE KEEP US SAFE*
This isn’t going to end. 		Whether it’s #coronavirus or not, this is our new normal. We must create compressive global health policies and address the inadequacies that greatly affect poor and minority people. This is a climate change issue. A human rights issue. And so much more
As of this Saturday, they're closing Disneyland, California Adventure Park and Universal Studios Hollywood. I guess it's no joke right now. #CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19 #COVID2019
I'm angry and sad ...how selfish you be?  Why aren't you taking this seriously? You are putting others at risk! Be diligent! Wash your hands, keep a social distance and *please* don't travel! #airhugs #caringisnothsharing #COVID19 #covid19Canada #CoronavirusPandemic
While people are out there hoarding toilet paper, I’m over here worrying about our country having another Great Depression. 		Let’s do all we can to support independent businesses, our communities and most of all other humans. #bekind #CoronavirusPandemic #comminityfirst #love
I think the uk does need to go on lockdown for at least 7 days...		Clearly the virus can’t be contained...		Work should pay there staff wages through sick leave. 		To many lives at risk here		But then how will you even survive? How will low income families find it? #Covid_19
Don`t panic but take it seriously. Let`s fight both the virus and the anxiety. We all wish to stay home but life must go on. Protect the entry points. All the more your hands and your soul. Also sentido kumon. #Covid_19
Y’all		It’s time to set aside the political stuff. 	It’s time to set aside the hard feelings. 	It’s time to realize the next couple of months will be weird. 	It’s time to come together and ride this rollercoaster together and try to get through this the best we can. 	#Coronavirus
Our hearts go out to everyone - in all walks of life, and all across the world - whose lives have been turned upside-down by the #CoronavirusPandemic.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you all in this difficult and uncertain time. #StaySafe #CountYourBlessings
With a global health crisis like this, now is not the time to argue and panic. Now is the time to pray and work together. #coronavirus #Catholics
Just Bc COVID-19 might not concern you, does not mean that it can’t kill your loved ones who have autoimmune diseases, respiratory issues, etc. so please, just wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water. A lil hygiene won’t kill you. #CoronavirusPandemic
Hey people, no need to panic. Just practice proper hygiene. If you have a chronic illness, stay away from people. Don't visit our seniors in long-term care facilities. They're vulnerable. JUST USE COMMON SENSE and stop hoarding TP and Lysol wipes. #Covid_19 #CoronavirusPandemic
It is not the time for Republican vs. Democrat. Life’s are at stake. It is up to Congress and the President to make sure ALL Americans are safe, protected and taken care of from this pandemic. Stop with they petty Social justice BS. #CoronavirusPandemic
Can't stop thinking that there are actually still people who believe the #coronavirus is a hoax. Just boggles the mind. 		I guess these are the people that still believe #Trump &amp; his band of incompetent turds.		IMO Trump is toast this Nov.		#LiesKill	#JustTellUsTheTruth
Why are people not taking Corona Virus seriously? The mortality rate of infected of 5%  or more in Italy is staggering! 	People don't realize how dangerous it is &amp; even if you get over it can scar you for life (literally) or you can spread it to your family members.#Coronavirus
Let me just take this moment to say that if by October you think the #CoronavirusPandemic will make a great Halloween costume, it won’t. Don’t even think about it.
This seems extreme but it's effective in stopping the spread of the virus. I'm going crazy tbh having my freedom taken away but what can ya do. Just letting you know that this might be your situation also..hopefully not, just be prepared. #coronavirus
So we’ve decided to cancel the birthday party for our lil princess 👸🏻. 		It’s ok we can do it next time ya baby girl. 	#Covid_19

Touch base with elderly neighbors and friends during this time of #COVID19 ...they may be anxious and/or afraid to ask for help. And when this has passed, keep the connection going 💞
14-day LOCKDOWN	Stay safe beautiful people. Good health is wealth. #Covid_19
We have to pray and unite as one during the  #CoronavirusPandemic. When schools close, some children will go hungry. When places close, some people will not get paid. We need to support and love one another.
So, stay indoors for 14 day, I probably won’t get paid for it, but I understand. But wait, this thing is world wide in warm weather climates, so it probably won’t just go away. And everything I’ve read says you can keep getting it. I’m fine with a quarantine, than what? #COVID_19
The conference I was meant to go to in a couple weeks has been cancelled because of #Covid_19 		However it’s likely for the best, as my family are part of the high risk populations. It’s not worth the potential risk from being at a large and international event
So after hospital duty, I must change clothes (scrub suit )first before leaving the the lab. This way is to protect the world, the universe rather! #COVID19
Stay safe and healthy! #CoronavirusPandemic
Has anyone else had extremely frustrating conversations with their parents in the past 24 hours in which it becomes clear how incredibly un-seriously they are taking #CoronaVirus precautions?
Churches in U.K. are still gathering despite churches in America live streaming services and many large public gatherings globally being cancelled. Why are they not taking the safety of their congregations seriously and acting now? #CoronavirusPandemic
My body went through a lot with chemo/radiation. Since then, I have ridiculous immune reactions when exposed to the simplest things. I break out in a rash every time they flush my port (with saline only). Yeah, I’m worried that getting #Covid_19 would be particularly bad for me.
I’m not worried about #coronavirus. I’m worried about the economic downturn that will result from it.  	#Covid_19
#Covid_19  isn’t just a meme anymore, if not contained the ageing population are under serious threat
The government needs to act! stop nonessential travel, shut schools and universities, close sports events and music festivals. We need to learn from Italy or suffer the same fate #Covid_19
The #coronavirus might pull us apart physically for now. But as a people this should not be who we become in the long term. This too shall pass. Fear can sometimes feel stronger than Hope. But Hope overcomes all.
I for one am looking forward to hunkering down with my family for awhile. We’re lucky enough to have our health and a big family that all gets along. We may not be together like this 4 long. 		We will happily do our part to protect those at risk. 		#covid19 #pandemic #ShutItDown

Well, batch 2019-2020 had the worst possible school ending through out the past years. Hopefully this will all end soon and everyone will be safe :3 	Just a reminder to everyone to wear masks if you’re sick and drink lots of water while having vitamin C.	#Covid_19
We are in a pandemic!! Stop stressing about your vacations being cancelled and worry about your safety! Your life is worth more than a theme park!! #Disneyland #DisneyWorld #coronavirus
So my midwife recommended that I stay home from work immediately because apparently I actually do have a compromised immune system due to being pregnant. This now has me so much more paranoid about this virus 😩🦠😷 #Covid_19
Any Medical experts out there? If you contract Covid-19 today, when next season arrives, can we get it again? #Coronavirus #Covid_19 #doctors #nurses
You can literally hear the gears of society grinding to a halt #coronavirus #COVID19
Is anyone in the general population reacting a normal amount to #coronavirus ?	Like not making it a complete joke OR buying 8 packs of TP.
Can’t believe people right now. Stop hoarding. Stop panicking. Stop taking masks away from healthcare workers. Wash your hands. Do your laundry. Clean your counters. Just stay home and wait this out. And please stop thinking you’re invincible!! #Covid_19
They believe up to 10,000 people are probably infected even though only 590 cases have tested positive. This means other countries should be wary of their actual numbers. You can only find positive cases of #coronavirus if you test for it!Now 3rd death of #COVID19 in Poland.	It scares me a little bit more
Wuhan residents are still wearing masks 3 months later.  Americans need to get over the stigma of wearing a mask fast and the government needs to distribute millions of them fast #COVIDー19 #Covid_19PH #COVID19 #coronavirus #SaturdayThoughts #covid19ma
The same people that disregarded the Chinese data in January/February are now telling us the China data shows that the virus is receding. 		#COVID19
I know we're frightened &amp; scared. I know we're worried for ourselves &amp; our loved ones but PLEASE spare a thought for those doctors, nurses &amp; hospital staff who are at the frontline, working excessive hours &amp; putting their own health at risk to care for us. #COVID19 #NHSThankYou
Social distancing and canceling schools/events is of course inconvenient, but so is possibly giving #Covid_19 to someone with a compromised immune system. Canceling/rescheduling events is not over dramatic. It’s saving lives like mine.
#coronavirus. A big salute to the doctors,nurses &amp; the police who are working round the clock to help people👍🏻
Please my fellow citizens, take the necessary precautions to protect yourself, your family, your friends, etc. These with elderly &amp; ailing family members, take extra care. #coronavirus is no joke and it knows no boundaries.
From midnight, all non-essential public places in France will be closed until further notice! It is time for more countries to do the right thing! #FlattenTheCurve #staythefuckhome #covid19 #confinement #pandemic #StopTheSpread

So just in case anyone reads this- actually feeling better today, temperature come back down so on the mend. 9 days since I was in contact with someone who was put into isolation for coming into contact with someone with Coronavirus so make of that what you will #coronavirus
We are staying open until the closure becomes mandatory which puts us out there for exposure until the last minute but it also gives me a check. I feel like a pawn. There’ll be no check for weeks once we close #coronavirus #work
May Allah Protect everybody from corona virus and other diseases. Aameeen 🤲🏽.   #COVID19 #SaturdayMorning
Imagine if #COVID19 lasts for longer. Has anybody detailed the consequences to countries economy and to ordinary people. No work, no traveling, no money, no food, and then?
Officially in lock down here in Spain, for minimum 15 days, hopefully this will lower our cases and avoid more deaths.	#IWillStayAtHome #YoMeQuedoEnCasa	#QuedateEnTuCasa	#CoronavirusEspaña	#Covid_19	#LockDownSpain	#LockDown
This shit is getting out of hand, people blaming the Chinese is NOT OKAY and you shouldn't treat them any different than anyone else because all people no matter race have it it's bullshit #Covid_19
One good thing that’s come from the #COVID19 is I’m hearing from good friends I haven’t in years. Seems to be bringing everyone together 😊
Send out healing energy to the world for this #Covid_19
Okay UK, the #Covid19 #coronavirus infection rates are going up and it’s getting widespread amongst the population. If you haven’t already it’s time to #ISOLATEtheELDERLY Get anyone older or frail to isolate now whilst it spreads through the young and healthy #herdimmunity
Gosh how does one do a funeral in the time of #coronavirus? No large gatherings, no assuring touches, no wiping the tears off your face 😐

I refuse to give in to panic and chaos. Yes, these are hard times, but with common sense and consideration we can make it.	Hold on to what makes you feel good: music, artwork, movies, gaming. Plus, the #earperfamily is here to support each other! 	#Covid_19
Everyone needs to take the social distancing measures seriously.		‘I am likely to survive it if I contract the virus.’		That does not represent the effect of the virus to people you encounter.		Be a responsible member of society.	#Covid_19 #COVID2019
#coronavirus as humans you can only control what you can control so please stop focusing on what is not in your grasp and take care of what is front of you, we all got this #wewillovercome
Everyone needs to understand the basic principles of public health, particularly that health is social. #COVID19 is showing that we have a long way to go on this front. This is so important that basic public health needs to be incorporated into every high school curriculum.
Confused?  Why do u need a test to confirm your symptoms? If u think u have #COVID19, quarantine yourself.  There's no treatment you're missing out on.  If you're case is really serious, go to a hospital.
Just returned from a grocery store in #Philadelphia . Most stuff is available except toilet paper. Don't do #panicbuying and we'll all be fine from the #coronapocalypse #COVID19
Dear Everone. Wash your hands, stay calm and stay healthy. Act, don't overreact. #Covid_19 is something to take serious, but if we can work together and share our soaps and hand sanitizers (and apparently T.P) then the mortality rate will remain 2 per 100,000 #COVID19 #Facts
This is time when we need to forget about countries and religions. 		we have to fight with this #COVIDー19 together.		#coronapocalypse #coronavirus #Covid_19PH #CoronaVirusUpdates
Here is my #coronavirus fear. IF it settles like a flu season, then we’re only going to get a global partial break in this fear and insane sense of death and sickness.... and that it will come back next fall. So what are we going to do?. Are we prepared ? Are we gonna see pt 2?
well, boris johnson, look where not closing the schools has gotten us so far....	800 cases at 2pm yesterday....	....	1100 cases less than 24 hours later.	Congratulations!	That’s a 300 case rise in less than 24 hours.	And THAT is a 37.5% rise nationally.	#coronaUK #coronavirus
it is incredible to see the inginuity &amp; commitment to service librarians bring to their field in this time of crisis. live-streaming storytimes, organizing drive-up book pickups &amp; compiling lists of distance services. with patron safety in mind, we continue to serve. #Covid_19
Switzerland has twice as many cases per capita than China. Why are we still reporting absolute numbers? Surprised to see Switzerland not making enough news compared to other EU counties. #Switzerland #coronavirus

been cancelled. Very tough as a racing driver to look forward to the start of the season for months and have something like this happen, however I trust that we will get the #coronavirus under control, and be able to have a fantastic racing season. Looking forward to may! (2/2)
Social distancing will be a temporary instrument to deal with #Covid_19. However steps taken towards community well-being and sustainable living will matter far more in the long run.
Update: Doctors from other departments will be deployed to ED as currently facing shortage of ED doctors/staffs due to #COVID19 outbreak. 		It’s happening, guys! 😔	Stay safe everyone! Stay safe healthworkers! Pray for us please, in combating this #COVIDー19 	#frontliners
How can they claim that they’re targeting a steady flow of incoming and outgoing patients to hospitals when they aren’t testing people? Who knows if they have it? Are they in a rammed pub right now spreading it to hundreds of people? #coronavirus #COVID19
Cool to see NBA players &amp; organizations helping employees cover their pay, gonna be tough for a lot those people hopefully we see the same energy from other sports. #Covid_19
Seeing as all these new cases of #COVID19 in SA are from people travelling into the country, one can’t help but wonder how many cases entered the country before we started testing? Closing borders may make people feel safer, but I think that ship has sailed. #CoronavirusInSA

It’s sad to see some self declared educated aunties/stupid blokes sharing third class non serious tweets about #coronavirus , trying to compare this natural calamity with stupidities of youth in Pakistan with no relevance and common sense. Aunties/weirdos please tweet sense.

I'm actually comforted by the rising number of people diagnosed with #COVIDー19. This means that people are being tested. 		REMEMBER: There are 10-25x more people WITH #coronavirus than what has been reported. Now it's about finding out who has it.
Like many others who decided to close today because of #COVID19 I debated with myself back &amp; forth for days. As difficult as it was I’m so glad now that I did it I’ll sleep a bit easier tonight. Do the right thing for everyone #closethepubs #closetherestaurants #LockdownIreland
You may think #COVID19 wont affect you or you can’t spread it. But if we don’t #stayhome, hospitals will be overwhelmed. Car accident, heart attack, stroke patients etc (anyone seeking hospital) will all be at risk due to lack of resources. Not just Covid patients are at risk.
I don’t think I’ve ever been more disappointed in people my age. Your spring break vacation isn’t worth it, stay home, it’s what we owe each other. #COVID19

And for all the people who are mistakenly waiting for the summer to arrive thinking they hot weather kills #CoronaVirus germs.		IT IS A MYTH		Corona germs can be transmitted in any weather, any temperature any climate		So please exercise caution &amp; investigate. Thanks.
With as horrible as my immune system is, and how long I stay sick just from strep throat or a cold, I probably wouldn't survive getting the #coronavirus 	Please wash your fucking hands and stay home when you can.
If you’re not worried about how you are going to put food on your table and pay your bills through this, then please consider donating to your local food bank, meals on wheels or Senior center. We can get through this together. #COVIDー19 #coronavirus
I’m proud of my home. Portugal has taken the right preventative measures at the right time. 		Meanwhile The Netherlands is still out here playing. Bars, clubs and restaurants were full last night. It’s as if people don’t know what a pandemic is. #COVID19
I very happy to see that with the fear of the #coronavirus, food security is not being forgotten. We are working hard to make sure our students are supported and they never have to worry about their next meal
Why nobody helps Italy from EU, UN, WHO whatever? They are living a crisis, people are suffering to find beds, intensive care units are full, doctors have to make decision among patients 😔 #coronavirus #ItalyCoronavirus
If you venture out to the store or a pharmacy or anywhere, be sure to thank the staff for being there during these crazy times. Many of those brave souls are so relieved to get a kind word. #COVID19 #CoronavirusUSA #SayThankYou
Stay safe everyone. It is important we take this seriously. Let’s all be responsible towards ourselves and others. Thoughts and love to all, especially those severely affected. We will get through this together. #COVID19 #FlattenTheCurve

The role of #China in anti-corona measures is marvellous. World must learn from China how to control #CoronavirusOutbreak , instead of blaming each other. This is a pandemic and countries need to take serious steps!!		#CoronavirusPandemic
Stockpiling is feeding into the alarmist trend and you’re also infecting others around you- Fear is very infectious. Have common sense and brush up on your etiquettes, be wary but also know that actually quarantining yourself on such short notice is virtually impossible. #COVID19
People are not taking this serious enough. Don’t be a fucking idiot. Don’t be Selfish. Distance yourself. #CoronavirusPandemic
Next person that rolls their eyes because we're concerned about #coronavirus gets a full on butt punch. The grocery store we go to just confirmed one of their employees tested positive. When it gets closer to your family, I'll happily remind you that it's stupid to be concerned.
Which is why we need to do our best to contain the virus at an early stage and prevent it’s spread in our community! Avoid/cancel unnecessary outings and travel. #COVID19 #COVID19india #coronavirusindia
Can Pakistan please have travel ban for 2-3 weeks? Unless we stop the travel ban, no amounts of lockdowns and closure of institutions/offices will hold off the spread of the virus. #CoronaVirusUpdates #COVIDー19 #CoronavirusOutbreak

#COVIDー19 is a virus.  It’s not going to disappear. We’re all going to have to deal with this at some point. 80% only get mild symptoms. Children are less likely than any other group to get severe symptoms. It’s an adult virus. Learn about #coronavirus instead of panicking.
I just got home from work. Exhausted from a week of creating &amp; implementing #COVID19 related process changes in the ED. In many ways, I’m scared as we approach the next phase of this outbreak in #YYC. But, I feel compelled to pause and acknowledge the ever growing pride I feel 1/

The media has incentive to sensationalize #COVID19 but these "red pill" mfs saying ignore this disease while ignoring death rates for at-risk populations like the elderly and the immunocompromised. There's evidence that these groups also face irreparable lung damage as a result
The United States is prepping to become ground zero for #COVID19, people just can't #StayTheFHome; this is the downside of a 'free and non-totalitarian' stateCrisis like no other .

Comes to something when you feel you'd be better off living in a country presently more affected by #COVID19.		But seeing the community spirit of those in lockdown as well as hearing the news of how governments are responding makes me feel like we're lightyears behind in the UK.
The mortality rate of the 70-79 age category in Italy is 35.4%.		If the over-70’s don’t want to #selfisolate, they have a 1-in-3 chance of dying.		We’re trying to help you.		#covidー19uk #coronavirus #COVIDー19 #StayAtHome #COVID19 #StayHome #FlattenTheCurve
Don’t respond the same way when asked to consider the larger picture. Be considerate of all that will and could be affected. We are in this together. #Covid_19
Just came back from a trip to grocery store, lots of empty shelves. People are looking so stressed. Kudos to cashiers, stock clerks, anyone working in retail during this challenging times. You are under paid and seldom appreciated. Thanks to each of you!! #cdnpoli #coronavirus
Have food companies thought about food delivery services during a lockdown? Have the delivery people wear protective gear and have them deliver things to households that need these things? #CoronavirusOutbreak #CoronaVirusSA #Covid_19

Why won’t people listen to the experts? If frontline healthcare providers aren’t scared and are *trying* to explain sensible information, why would you not listen? Your google search and tv anchor did not make you more knowledgeable. 💡 #healthcare #Frontlines #COVID19 #FixRx
I was reading that many cases of spread of #COVID19 are caused by asymptomatic people. If that is the case systematic screening could be a good solution to understand where the virus resides.
I have heard that #Covid19 has also struck in the USA. I advise you not to leave your house. Always wash your hands and buy masks and latex gloves. In ITALY, the supermarkets are always open and there is no lack of food. A strong hug to all. 🤗

My anxiety is off the charts with the #coronavirus please if you can stay home. Think of the wave of people that will sick that our hospitals can’t handle. #CoronavirusOutbreak
Just a wee thought here but maybe we should try to maintain a stable government until this potentially very serious crisis is over and *then* we can call for resignation yeah? #CoronavirusOutbreak
The US government should really consider implementing some sort of rent/mortgage bail out.  		If things get really bad, no one should be losing their homes for not being able to go to work.		#COVIDー19 #coronavirus #USA

You know what? It’s okay to be scared. This is a scary time. We have never seen something like this before. The virus is scary. The economy is scary. The way people are acting is scary. Don’t let anyone make you feel bad for being scared of what’s going on right now. #coronavirus
First of all, we need to stop putting a time line on this virus as if someone is controlling it. YOU CAN RECOVER FASTER if you stay home and and STOP SPREADING IT. I understand the struggle, we all have bills and have to eat. STOP PANICKING #COVID19 #coronapocolypse
final thoughts for today on #coronavirus is assume it’s on everything and that everyone has it. It’s almost impossible to not touch stuff between hand hygiene and eating as an example. Maintain 2 metres between everyone and stop being self conscious about reminding people as much
Living with someone who goes on with things same as usual with #COVID19. Doesn't get what that means for me if I'm infected. I'm all anger and sadness right now. So much sadness. Bad enough most of the symptoms are similar to what I already live with. #chronicillness #fibro

I'm kinda glad so many NBA players got tested. Many positive tests with only a few showing symptoms shows how young people are far more likely to be carriers and not know it.  	#CoronavirusOutbreak
Friends on my IG still partying up in Cabo. Laughing at having to self isolate when they get home. I hope you morons get stranded at an airport. You're selfish assholes. #COVID19
My wife, who has terminal cancer, Mom wants to come for a visit tomorrow with nieces and nephews. Given the circumstances with #COVID19, am I overreacting by being upset by this? #stayhomeCanada
I have a friend who goes to the store everyday. I said how about limiting your exposure to #COVID19 by shopping once/week? He said, I'm not gonna get it. Does he know something, we don't know? #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID2019 #Quarantine
Let's #BreakTheChain to defeat #COVID19 	↔️ Social Distancing	✋ Hand Hygiene	🧹 Routine cleaning &amp; disinfect surfaces	📜 Be Informed	✅ Follow the instructions of health officials	Remember, we will overcome this. 	Share the word, not the disease.
Hope for the best and prepare for the worst	#COVID2019 #workingfromhome #CoronavirusOutbreak
Today our ICU team sat for lunch together to debrief a challenging case. Challenging cases aren’t unique in an ICU specialized in liver dz, but they feel even heavier these days. We have no #COVID19 cases yet, but the uncertain future weighs heavy on our hearts and minds.
#selfquarantine and #MartialLaw is the only way at current to extremely slow the #coronavirus ....whats your thoughts?
Stay healthy &amp; safe! Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk, #closeretail #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic
Are people actually stupid for going on vacation during #CoronaCrisis, you are basically paying to go on holiday for lockdown lol 😂 Thank the Lord i’m not in Spain right now! #CoronavirusOutbreak
I’m trying to stay away from the public as much as I can. I have a compromised immune system &amp; my health is at risk. If I get sick, I probably won’t make it. This is all so scary. Please stay inside guys, this is serious. 🙏🏼😭 #Covid_19 #coronavirus
#CloseDaycares if the U.S. Surgeon General is telling our country to act like everyone has #coronavirus and to STAY HOME, why are daycares still open?! SHUT. US. DOWN.
to all the people who WONT quarantine themselves at home, some of us would like to return to our normal lives. Finish our senior year, finish our 1st year of college or to just go buy some flippin toilet paper. So please stay home. #coronavirus #COVID19 #stayhome #imisscollege
There are no words to express how much we appreciate our Healthcare professionals. Thank You! #coronavirus #COVID19 #NewOrleans #nola #healthcare #hero #pandemic
I hope everyone is staying save and remember we need to beat #covid19 together.
People’s selfish unwillingness to make temporary sacrifices to their lives will be the reason #CoronavirusOutbreak persists longer than it should, continues to hurt people’s ability to earn a living, and puts lives in danger.
Right, you whingers. School will be closed from Friday. This doesn't mean leaving your little one  run a havoc. Or doing playdates. It's a #quarantine not a holiday 😏		#coronavirus 	#lockdown
in all seriousness PLEASE remember to social distance in this crucial time. we all have a duty to work together to #FlattenTheCurve and prevent unnecessary deaths. #coronavirus #COVID19 #SocialDistancing
I don't know who needs to hear this right now, but not everything going on at the moment is an overblown conspiracy 🙄🙄#coronavirus #2020sucks
Great to see over due light shone on important sectors of Irish (&amp; Global) society during the #coronavirus outbreak.

I would also like to say a huge thank-you to all the medical staff and emergency personal that are out there doing what they do to save lives and keep people safe. I am humbled.#StaySafeStayHome #CoronavirusOutbreak
All the protests must be stopped for the precautions. 	We know that you all are brave. But this government is in no mood to listen to you. 		So for the safety of your family and friends you must stop.  	#CoronaVirus
I can’t wait for things to get back to normal, this whole #CoronavirusOutbreak is getting crazy. I hope everyone is staying safe during these dark times, sending my love and thoughts.
Newsflash- people really don’t care about what’s going on. I’m curious how many people are off work, and just out and about enjoying their day off. GO HOME, GET BACK from me.  #Coronavirus
Time to head home, disrobe in the garage and scrub down in the shower after a day at the hospital #medtwitter #orthotwitter #COVID19
Cases have been reported in neighbing countries - Ghana, Benin Republic, Cameroon. Others are Liberia, Burkina Faso.	If we don't have the right equipment at the land &amp; sea borders, shut them.	#coronavirus 	#CoronaVirusNigeria 	#CoronaVirusLagos
Well its official, my fiancé and I are both laid off. This is heartbreaking and frustrating. #COVID19 is real. I hope people social distance themselves and quarantine if needed so this can end as quickly as possible! Even people who arent sick are being impacted in a very big way
So people claim their children are their world, yet they are on vacation subjecting their so called beloved children to #COVID19 and then bringing it back and subjected others to it. You’re what’s wrong with America.
If you think this virus is funny and/or nothing but a media scandal, YOU are the problem. Occasional, walk by stupidity is one thing. Willful ignorance is another. #CoronavirusOutbreak

Close all schools? But let their parents go to work, use public transport, get the VIRUS and BRING it HOME.	Wow ☠ . 	How does that even make sense.		#CoronavirusInSA #COVID19SouthAfrica 	#Covid_19
Why do I have to choose between my health or my job? 	#coronavirusI am not at all thrilled with Japan’s response to the #COVID19  pandemic. Apart from the closing of schools, it is business as usual... packed malls/bars &amp; crowded trains. Testing is hard to come by. Only govt facilities offer the test but only if high fever for 4 straight days.
For those parents out there that think it’s ok to let their kids play out whilst the schools are closed, YOURE ALL FUCKING IDIOTS!!! It’s not an extended holiday. It’s to keep them away from other kids to stop the spread! #coronavirus #schoolclosuresuk
#SocialDistanacing only seems to apply on my day off. 🤔 #LockdownLondon #StayAtHomeChallenge #Convid19uk #COVID19
Long distance relationships are hard anyway, but when #COVID19 stops you from seeing a loved one for potentially months on end, it gets pretty darn miserable. Be thankful if you’re isolated with your loved ones.

Palestinian political prisoners are held inside closed and crowded Israeli jails which would increase the possibility of being infected with #coronavirus. #SavePalestinePrisoners
It's time for the Canadian government to announce complete lock down in the country. Amazed to see people that are supposed to self quarantine are not taking enough precautions and visiting restaurants, banks, and grocery stores.	#COVID19ON #COVIDCanada  #COVID2019 #Covid_19
I’m glad grocery stores are making accommodations for the elderly and other vulnerable members of our communities. I’m saddened that they have to do so because members of our communities are too selfish in their panic. #coronavirus
The fact that my girl had asthma got me stressed out more bout this #COVID19
I have all the symptoms of the #coronavirus (I feel absolutely dreadful &amp; yes I’m self-isolating) but how do I know that it’s not just the flu? I quarantine myself for 2 weeks and then head back out into the world to only catch something I thought I’d already had? #COVID19
We must be mindful that we don't exacerbate the barriers to healthcare for people who are vulnerable and we support everyone to remain included in our new distanced society		Very proud of the Irish response so far in this situation 🇮🇪 everyone is being so helpful 🤗		#Coronavirus
Many people are welcoming folks from the UK who might have contracted the #CoronaVirus and they do not know that they might be aiding the spread. How do we get the word out. The government is just talking on TV. How many folks have TVs, or have power. We need to contain spread
Alot of news going round about #COVID19 please friends and families should be alert as predictions are made on scarcity and recession worldwide. If you have money please get enough food,Gas,medications and stay safe at your various homes. Prepare ahead for the crisis.❤✌

Trains and metro running 50% capacity but the commuter rate is 100%	Rush= 2x	Double the risk	Such a stupid decision 👏	#coronavirus #coronavirusindia #Mumbai #mumbaicorona

People are learning quickly. Even in Berlin. So the reality out there is not what the cynical version of #Corona Twitter wants us to believe. Sad fact is that all these adjustments are introduced weeks to late. #COVID19 has not been taken seriously at Bundeskanzleramt. (2)
"it's just the flu" ok but I don't want the fucking flu either! #coronavirus
Ya’ll want ya’ll jobs back? Stay inside for two weeks! Or go outside and spread the virus and have 3 months of unemployment. Your choice! #coronavirus #reality #stupidity #oops
It actually infuriates me that people can be so ignorant that they still want to to go clubbing, restaurants, big public places when the government have advised not to for our best interests to STOP the virus spreading. #COVID19
listen people are dying that have never died before. be safe 💯 #coronavirus
#coronavirus note to those traveling wearing rubber gloves:  they do not protect you when you touch things with them then touch your bags, face, etc with the gloves.  They simply took place of your skin🙄
99% of them are innocent and they're unaware of this situation. So apart from screening, myself and most of my friends are educating them about the risk they're facing now. Just a little step in fighting against #COVID19 	I will continue this until my health allows me 🙏

To everybody who thinks the #coronavirus isn’t a big deal, consider this: your chance of dying from it if you catch it is about the same as rolling a pair of dice and getting snake eyes.  Do you really want to play those odds?
Did ya really just ask me why I cant stop taking immunosuppressants if I'm "so worried" ?? Didn't know that I should suffer my chronic illnes so I can "stop worrying" and "come chill" #coronavirus is a huge risk to me (and my mom) even if I "look healthy" and happen to be 24

Since a lot of people still aren’t taking the proper precautions against #COVID19, bio analysts predict a best case scenario of 30,000 people infected by April 13th. That’s almost half the total infected in China. Next best case scenario? Over 120,000. #CoronaVirusUpdate

The best way to control the spread of #COVID19 is: 1. Pray vigoursly to seek forgiveness and protection from God. 2. Adopt cleanliness measures to the extent as if u have the virus to protect others from it and as if everyone else have a virus  to protect yourselves from it.
Still seeing lots of calls for the HSE to release info on specific locations cases of #COVID19 are bring detected in		Why?		Your job is to act as though you have it and exercise extreme caution. This is the same whether everyone in your town has it or nobody has it
A school age child in Mobile AL tested positive.  Hope its not a False positive test.  A lot if parents and a bunch of children may have been exposed. 🙏	#coronavirus

I'm frustrated by the prevalence of people spewing what they "believe" about #COVID19 publicly. This isn't a religious ideology. Science trumps your beliefs. Over 470 people died in Italy today, this is more dangerous than the flu.

Why we don’t learn from Other countries about how treat  #coronavirus. China, tested the people and just redirect the people to a different building, to those who were +. Uk is using the same  🏥 4 everybody. So everybody is touching he same lift, the same doors and all around.
#COVID19 rule#3: Being young+healthy does not mean you’re exempt from social isolation. The disease spreading will overwhelm the health care system and cost lives of elderly and the young. We may have to wait years for the economy to recover but it will.

Husband has just text ....”mums popping up tomorrow” ..... errr no she’s not mate 😷 seriously what part of STAY AT FUCKING HOME DON’T PEOPLE FUCKING UNDERSTAND. Jesus wept. #coronavirus
Just found out from a family friend that the majority of deaths have been Muslims. PLEASE stop socialising, stop going to the mosques and spreading the virus! You can pray at home!!! 😡		#Coronavirus #COVID19 #CoronaPandemic
The key workers list - what about hotel staff housing NHS workers and people self isolating? Surely they should be on the key workers list too? #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #coronavirus
Just remember, we made it through 9/11, sever tornados, fires, hurricanes, floods, and even wars. We can get though this COVID-19. Find music, humor, patience, kindness, and love and we will get through this. #QuarentineLife #coronavirus #StaySafeStayHome
Here's something: Don't ask how I know this, but whatever test for #Coronavirus a certain regional hospital network in Pennsylvania is using takes SEVEN DAYS to produce a result. That, to me, seems way too long. #CoronaCrisis
Healthcare professionals don’t scare easily. Everyday, we see illness do unimaginable things to people. And then, at the end of the day we go home, kick off our shoes, and watch some Netflix. We don’t scare easily. And #COVID19 scares the hell out of us. So take it seriously.
#coronavirus 🦠is everywhere. Stay safe, stay home.   We'll beat this, we have dealt with worse.
Unusually serious tweet: I live with a vulnerable person, I don't have corona symptoms but I am taking steps to maintain distance/not sharing towels etc I usually cook for both of us, can I still do that? Worrying and can't find anything about that #coronavirus #SelfIsolation

Sorry I haven't been on Twitter, much... Struggling with a minor bout of depression.  Probably because my meds ran out at weird intervals, and going outside is dangerous for people like me. *sigh*		(I get nervous every time I think I have a sore throat...😣)	#COVID19 #coronavirus
Key worker sends kids to school. Kids mix and spread #coronavirus among themselves and staff. Kids return home and infect key worker parents. Key workers self isolate. How does this help?
If all bars, clubs, gyms etc are closing why are clothes shops and other none essential shops still open! You’re telling me shops like Primark that are very busy shops that people do go to socialise are okay!!!??? Close all shops except supermarkets and essentials! #COVID19
I’m genuinely scared of going to my job next week to which I absolutely love, all cause of this virus going around, I do not stop, I am a support worker, people still need to be cared for. If our country goes into lock down, no doubt I’ll still have to work 🙄 #COVID19
I was told not to come to work for 7 days because I’ve been in close contact with a coworker who has tested positive for #COVID19 . 		Tishman Speyer is the worst company I’ve ever worked for. As of this time, #RockefellerCenter buildings are open, and I do not know why.
Survived my first week as a #HealthCareWorker fighting this #CoronaVirus
So overwhelmed, so anxious, how many ppl do I worry about. How many ppl do I stop from being wreckless. It’s mentally draining living like this.  #CoronaVirusUpdate #CoronaInPakistan #CoronavirusPandemic
I really never thought I’d see the day where my job, my health, my life, my families lives, my friends lives, were all threatened by something like this. I’m calling this WWIII. But this time we’re all at war with the same enemy. #CoronaCrisis #COVID19 #SocialDistancing #wwiii
So #COVID19 could have broader symptoms and more long term impact than is currently expected. Medical teams working on this disease would benefit from collaborating with veterinarians who have been studying coronaviruses for decades. 2/2

Regardless of if commencement is canceled, I won’t be walking. I had every intention to, but #COVID19 put into perspective not only the cost to one’s health but also the cost to walk across a stage for a piece of paper &amp; a photo. That one moment doesn’t negate the work I put in.
Of the many concerns of #Coronavirus, livelihood deprivation of daily wage earners is a serious one. Starvation can ignite civil unrest &amp; deaths. Providing at least daily nourishment to them is the responsibility of the community. Let’s stand together &amp; beat the virus. - Sg

Why is there an international glove shortage? Because people like the gas attendants wear gloves and change them with each customer. Unless you are a health care professional or first responder you do NOT need gloves. Wash your hands and let us have the supplies we need. #covid19

Observations: Older / at risk not getting the message. Couples walking round Tesco, too close to everyone. No concept of keeping back at counters or tills. And bizarrely, parents with children going shopping? Why? Lock the country down, some people can't be educated  #Covid_19
Am at some place near Eldoret town and I can confirm that here people are serious about #COVID19 ... You can't visit any premise without washing your hands first. Really commendable
J &amp; I hopped in the car to get out of the house and just drive around. I am honestly shocked, and truly disappointed to see how many people are still out. Target, sure. But Best Buy and Hobby Lobby?! WHY?!! People need to wake up and take this serious. 😷🦠#StayHome #coronavirus
Don't go out side please #coronavirus
It still amazes me the stupidity of human beings !	Open your eyes folks people are dying, do what your told by the government and do your bit to help the country through this pandemic. Its not much to ask really 🇬🇧 ! #Covid_19 #covid19UK #covid19scotland

A lot of people returning to Canada this weekend left last weekend when they knew the full scope of this #Covid_19 situation. 	These people feel invincible. 	The likelihood that we get good self isolation compliance from them is low.
In self isolation as 2 of us now have symptoms but we need to search various stores to find stuff for dinner. If people didn't panic buy, we could go to 1 shop. But since those scum r buying all the food, we have to travel farther each time. Fuck u all. #stockpilingUK #Covid_19

In 1 MONTH (21st Feb-21st Mar 2020) there have been over 4,000 #Covid19 deaths in Italy.  Comparison, to Northern Ireland in the last 3 months 2019 (provisional data) there were just over 4,000 of ALL deaths in total! This is 1 serious nasty virus. Be safe, take precautions.
i don't have social anxiety but the supermarket was so overwhelming today that i went to the loo and had a cry. when i came out, someone had pinched the flowers i bought for my nan for Mother's Day. the only flowers left were dying or damaged. so heartbroken i just left #COVID19
Lots of people on road. Vehicles are less in Delhi. Not everyone was wearing masks. Was on Lodhi Garden road. Dating was going on, they dont seems to care about #coronavirus #WuhanCoronavirus #ChinaVirus

Community spread has already started since a week. Refusal by Indian Govt  just because it "tracked" active #covid19 patients isn't going to prove the fact that there is no community spread.
Love seeing these commercials for restaurants. You can order meals to go. It will keep these business a live and keep some people still working earning a paycheck. Be safe out there! #CoronavirusPandemic #StayAtHome
Glad I live in a small enough town and we shouldn't be to badly affected with #coronavirus 	I'm seeing loads of pictures from across england with no social distancing and its giving me anxiety. 	Feel for the ones trying.
In a couple of years time, someone with will calculate the number of people that lost there lives to Coronavirus, by keeping pubs open for 6 hours longer... #BorisJohnson #COVID19
We are in a critical public health problem that requires global cooperation. #Covid_19 #stayhome #globalhealth
Peoples inability to distance themselves socially is absolutely mind blowing. Temporarily isolating ourselves could mean all this being over in time for the summer. Thousands of life's saved. Surely people can go a few weeks chilling in the gaff 🤦‍♂️ #Covid_19
Along with exercising the necessary precautions, let’s pledge to drive our positive thoughts to eradicate this #coronavirus. There’s no harm in doing it. Let’s stop spreading the news with negativity, think positively that our world is free of this #coronavirus
Get your gas mask ready guys #Coronavirus
Question. Can pubs stay open if they are moving their tables outside and allowing people to buy food/ drink and eat it outside????? I've just seen this happening... surely not?!?!?! #COVID19  #CoronaCrisisuk #pubsclosed
Watching tv right now is so weird. The ads were made b4 #Covid_19 and are pushing trips to Vegas and selling things that are so not necessary... not that they really ever were b4. But still, it's super surreal.
Thanks to #AmazonPrime and #Netflix which give lots of different things to enjoy in such situation.. A very nice solution to fight with #Covid_19.. Enjoy the shows, stay at home, stay healthy and stay safe.
If you're not worried, you're not paying attention.#Covid_19
y u shouldn't shake anyone this period:	The #COVID19 is transmitted through Resp droplets; Most people cover their mouths with their hands when they cough or sneeze which would obviously be contaminated with RD afterward. This droplets can be transferred during a handshake...
Your life is not something that someone gives you, but something you choose yourself...so be at home as long as you can and be safe ....	#StaySafeStayHome 	#Covid_19 	#lockdownknockdown

At a time like this, cigarette companies should be the ones running campaigns telling people to stop smoking that shit because y'all need your lungs because Corona attacks your lungs basically. Without the ability to breathe, you're dead. Anyone? #Covid_19 #Covid19InSA
I've nearly finished fighting of a #COVID19 infection. Things I have learned: 		1) Its not always mild for younger people		2) The early stages were barely noticable		3) You will need all the paracetomol you can safely take		4) You need to take this seriously		5) People are kind.

Having spoken to and read accounts from varying healthcare professionals in various places, it's clear that what our leadership is telling us is and will be happening is not the reality of what is actually happening. Coordination is shoddy and haphazard. #Covid_19 #Coronavirus
Also watching him coughing whilst preparing orders handling money and not once did he wash his hands #Covid_19 #COVID_19uk I imagine you would be able to witness this on the cctv in store.

sad to hear we lost our first Arizonian to #covid19 - please be careful and take a moment to think of those who are ill
It’s scarier that the reports of how many new people have #Covid_19 are essentially a week old because of how long it takes to get the results. Literally thousands could have it in Ireland right now and we wouldn’t even know.
Even, people should also follow the basic guidelines from government without any need of strict punishment. But as currently, only requests/ guidelines are not enough. Hence a strict process must be implemented quickly to quarantine people.	#WuhanVirus #CoronavirusPandemic
I don’t understand if you are picking up food to go you have to bring the entire family AND walk into the restaurant holding hands. Having an absolute panic right now. #Covid_19 #coronavirus

Why do #COVID19 testing results take so long? A person very close to me got tested this week, they told her 2-6 days for results in the meantime she’s locked at home with her immediate family-she’s very very sick! #SMH #IDontUnderstand #ThisIsNotAHoax
#Covid19 virus has an R0 of 6.6. Meaning that on average one infected  person could go on to infect atleast 6.6 other people. This can only be reduced by social distancing and self isolation. #Salonetwitter, please avoid crowded locations until the pandemic ends. Do am for Salone
Doctors can be your caretakers and curer, but also a potential spreader of the virus unless they are protected enough. Provide them with the protective kits already!! 	#lockdownpakistan 	#CoronavirusPandemic 	#StayHomeStaySafe

now i’m starting to hear about people i know dying from the #CoronavirusPandemic. this is getting terrifying. #Covid_19
I will block all people who actually believe #coronavirus is just a hoax or 'fake news'. The surge is yet to come in the UK and when it does I think we will see how unprepared our underfunded NHS is after ten years of tory cuts. #StayTheFHome #covid19UK

I had to get the fuck out of there as quick as possible. A man coughed all over the self checkout machine which made me turn my ass around and stand in a long ass line for regular checkout. People were wearing gas masks y’all! I’m like where they get that shit from? #Covid_19

Back in 2008, I had H1N1, I was a contracted employee and was not allowed to stay home and self-isolate &amp; recover. I was told that I HAD to stay at work, regardless of who might be exposed to my virus. I am glad to see #covid19 being taken seriously.

Took my 4 yr old for a walk yesterday. We walked by 3 parks but told him that he couldn't play with the other kids because of #COVID19. Perhaps all of Canada should close playgrounds for now. Social distancing ?Saw way too many groups of kids "socializing". Everyone, do your part
Dude, I keep seeing all of these reports of young ppl getting #coronavirus and how scary it is and... I’m not gonna lie, I’m scared. Like REALLY scared😐
Everyone STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM PEOPLE. STAY INSIDE OR 6 FT FROM PEOPLE!! Don’t know why that’s so fuckin hard. Ask your introverted friends. They can help you and tell you how to keep occupied at this time. Or you can ask me, I’ll help you. #covid19 #coronavirus
I work in a GP practice, I need to be at work...please follow social distancing when you’re outside #CoronavirusPandemic 🙏
Biggest spike in Italy is amongst younger patients...now hitting people hard in 40’s and 50’s.  I suspect lots of people who may have psychology distanced themselves from #coronavirus due to age may rethink if this does escalate along similar lines in UK.

I hate morning where my sleep was irregular and leave me with a terrible headache. Any type of physical issue is having me paranoid. Symptoms don’t match #COVID19 though. So I’m not too worried.		For now...

Damn, I get fucking alpha packs at 10% and you mean to tell me the death rate for covid-19 is 10%? Must stay away at all costs..... #coronavirus
I have to applaud Gen X and Millennials on how they are handling the seriousness of #COVID19.		Now as for Baby Boomers and Gen Z...can’t say the same for you.
If you know someone who has come back from abroad recently, ask whether they've been tested for #coronavirus #Covid_19 whenever they come in contact with you.		DEMAND PROOF!!!		It is your right to stay safe.		#India

This is how a country flattens the curve. Pay them to stay home! #Covid_19 #StayAtHome
It is clearly the right thing for public health, but I never thought I would live to see the day that required keeping six feet away from all my fellow humans. #Covid_19 😔
Please Stay at home  🙏#Coronavirus
Pakistan must move towards a #lockdownpakistan. Every hour, every day  that we delay is going to make dealing with the pandemic more difficult. Stay at home to protect yourselves &amp; others... #CoronavirusPandemic
I just washed my wallet and credit cards and I dont feel that makes me paranoid.	#Covid_19 #CoronavirusPandemic
There’s a BIG difference between a treatment and a vaccine. Make no mistake. Only when there’s widespread vaccination will this thing start disappearing from society... #COVIDー19 #coronavirus
If I ask you, would you prefer 	a) Temporary freedom 	b) Survival	What would be your answer? 	If it’s option (b), then you must do what the situation demands and the Govt commands	#CoronaVirusPakistan #lockdownpakistan #CoronavirusPandemic 	#CoronaVirusUpdate
Doctors, medical staff &amp; other workers are working 24x7 for US.	Stay Home for THEM! 	#COVID19
P A N D E M I C		The world is in danger,	But not because of anger.	A virus that can kill thousands,	COVID19, everyone.		I know this is a disease,	That can be a crisis.	But we have this day heroes,	They called it frontliners.		#COVID19 #WorldPoetryDay2020
But let's not lose heart. It can be slowed down. Stay in your homes, wash your hands regularly, call 1075 in case symptoms surface (coz state helplines most probably won't work) and don't hoard essential commodities		Doctors, Nurses and healthcare ppl need them more #Covid_19
Just loved this statement ... ”This virus has a very big ego, he will not come to your house unless you go out and invite it in" #CoronavirusPandemic	#StayHomeStaySafe	#CoronaVirus	#CoronaVirusUpdate	#IndiaFightsCorona	#JanataCurfew	#Andhrapradesh	#Telangana
If you show any symptoms make sure to call the hotlines made available and stay at home.I know we will soon beat #Covid19 as a team and community. Say a word of prayer for everyone and the world as a whole(Isaiah 46-4).
You have only got once in a life time opportunity to stay at home, lying in front of TV to save the world.	Don’t screw this up.		#StayHomeSaveLives 	#StayHomeStaySafe 	#CronaVirus 	#CoronavirusPandemic 	#JantaCurfew
I’ve been pretty quiet on here recently, dealing with the #Covid_19 stress and leaving school. Remember to practise social distancing, follow the government advice and also practise a bit of self-care. It’s a tough time for everyone ❤️
I balled my eyes out as we drove away. This is so depressing. 😭 #lovemygrannyandgramps #6ftaway #CoronavirusPandemic
It is extremely important to #StayAtHome, as much as is humanely possible. It could make a great deal of difference, particularly to the most vulnerable. If necessary to save lives, governments worldwide should introduce more stringent restrictions of movement. 	#Covid_19
Stay at home plzz🙏		#CoronaVirus
And the total tally of #covid infected passes the 300,000 mark globally. It seems, humanity is in deep deep danger. Until we stop the chain this will keep in increasing. Stay safe and maintain social distancing...	#CoronavirusPandemic 	#coronavirus 	#IndiaFightsCorona
Lessons from #COVID19 &amp; #PerintahKawalanPergerakan 		1) Self hygiene is IMPORTANT!	2) Saving money for emergency use is IMPORTANT!	3) Avoid spreading fake news is IMPORTANT!	4) Following the government's order is IMPORTANT!
I hate COVID-19, but what I hate more is the Zombie Apocalypse of Stupidity that it has caused. 		I have dealt with 100 Karens who think that the rules don’t apply to them for one reason or another. #callcenterproblems #Covid_19
Most of the #Covid_19 cases in India coming because people coming from abroad, advised to home quarantine, are not following advises. They are doing traveling, joining mass gathering and spreading the #Covid_19 virus all over.
You need to take a week off if you have a wee cough. Stay home and keep yourself and other safe. #coronavirus
Now that the EM match is done... Graduate the students early. Hospitals could use the help. 	#COVID19
Let’s put this into perspective:		AS OF TODAY:		13 deaths in Canada. 		1099 cases in Canada		Ontario has 377 cases, up 59		7279 awaiting results In Ontario 		If that’s not a wake up call I’m not sure what else will provoke you to #STAYATHOME #covid19 #onpoli
Second day in a row that Ireland’s new cases number has decreased - social distancing clearly working! Fair play everyone, keep it up 🙌🏻 #coronavirus

Absolutely disgusted with the 2 companies I work for, remaining open when they are non-essential, no care for the #NHS no care for its staff or anyone else! Pure greed and selfishness!! I'm embarrassed to even have to open my store.! #CoronaCrisis #Covid_19 #nhs
In awe of medical officials working overtime to fight the battle at the front with every possible skill.	Also in awe of WhatsApp University professors working from home overtime to fight science with every possible lie.	#CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19

Everyone has this #BillionDollarQuestion when would this #CoronavirusPandemic ends?? The answer is us.. We have to #StayHome #SocialDistancing and #behealthy ..	By following the instructions from the #Government we can #SaveLives of who is getting affected to #COVIDー19 #staysafe
If we are to learn anything, it should be these things: 1) when the WHO, the CDC, every doctor and nurse and government official ask you to stay indoors and shelter in place, you do it; and 2) which toilet paper brands you will never, never, ever buy again #coronavirus
People please stay at home. #coronavirus
#BREAKING: A woman in her 30s has died in the City of St. Louis from #COVID19. This is the first death in the city. This is again a reminder that ANY one, of ANY age, can be impacted by #coronavirus.
The scientists who find the killer vaccine to end this #COVID19 enemy deserve the #NobelPeacePrize and the thanks from a grateful world population. We are cheering all of you on! 😊👍
Boris Johnson used the same kind of language to talk to the nation as a worried parent might talk to a rebellious teen - c’mon guys it shouldn’t have to be this way. Stay. At. Home #LockdownNow #StayAtHomeSaveLives #coronavirus
Good morning - happy Monday and have a great day :-) brilliant to see the community spirit spreading let's make sure that's the only thing that spreads - if you're delivering stuff to the vulnerable we have some protocols we would be happy to share!! #COVID19 #community

Thanks to massive bunch of ignorant cockwombles we’re now not far off being on lockdown! Hope your moronic &amp; selfish picnics, gatherings &amp; lack of attention to the govt’s advice was worth it! TAKE. IT. SERIOUSLY! #SocialDistancing #covid19 #ConsiderOurVulnerable #ActResponsibly
The response to COVID-19 has only showed me that the US and UK safe like the two kids in the class always getting in trouble and getting detention because they don’t listen #medtwitter #COVID19
I stay in the house the weekend because I'm afraid to infection #coronavirus. But  in #Japan, some people go to hang out. I think it's depends on us that is whether coronavirus can to end. So, I think they should have awareness of crisis more and stay in the house.🏠		#Japanese
UK now on lockdown for 3 weeks, wonder if any of the people who still work with around 200+ people walking in and out will receive any pay in which to cover the hazard risk of being exposed too all of this at all? Especially the NHS and Supermarkets #coronavirus #UKLockdownNow
everyone has been telling me to wash my hands all the time and i washes them so much i now have rashes and it hurts so much 🤦‍♀️ #StayAtHomeSaveLives #COVID19
Just arrived at Gatwick from Sri Lanka (essentially a third world country) their measures against #coronavirus are infinitely better than ours on the basis ours don’t exist. Tells you all you need to know about Gov attitude to this. UK need to wake up fast!!
Who wants to protest against Boris Johnson where everyone is 4 feet apart 😳. Less lives would of been lost if he went into lockdown weeks ago. #LockdownNow #COVIDIOTS #COVIDー19 #fuckboris #StayAtHomeSaveLives #coronavirus
Lol close EVERYTHING for a month!!! #COVIDー19 #coronavirus
Part 4: Since the U.S. and Canada have agreed to lockdown their borders due to the #Coronavirus, perhaps it's time for us here in the U.S. to consider locking down our nation altogether, and give a 1-week notice to Americans abroad to return home, to prevent any further outbreak.
If you have to work go to work then go home. If you need groceries go get them then go home. If you need medicine go get it then go home. If you need...wait...want to hang out with friends, don’t. Stay home! #coronavirus #StayHome #SocialDistancing
The best way to approach social distancing is to pretend like you already have the virus.	#COVID19NL #COVIDー19 #covid19 #COVID19
If you need help with shopping, running errands, or even just need someone to talk to about your concerns and worries, please call me and I will do all that I can In shā Allāh 		#Yeg #COVID19 #coronavirus
Once it is safe to do so, every big city should hold ticker tape parades for its health care workers after we beat back #coronavirus .  HCWs will be the true heroes of this battle. #COVID19 #StayHome
I’m really pissed that SoMe FRIGGEN PEOPLE CANT PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING!! YOU ARE NOT HELPING THE PROBLEM WE ARE FACING!!!! IT WILL NOT GET BETTER IF YOU DONT LISTEN DONT THINK UR INVINCIBLE!!! Thx  u for coming to my ted talk #COVID19
Stay where you are.		Because of this Curfew/Lock down people are fleeing to their natives.		This will increase the spread from metropolitan cities to rural remote locations.		Kindly don't act as carriers and take this virus to the rural areas of the country.		#Covid19	#Corona
Maybe now people will start to take it seriously. It's not hard guys, stay at home!!! The message is short and clear #lockdownuk #coronavirus
On route to work (nhs) and the trains are reduced but, now the carriage is so busy you can’t do any social distancing. #COVID19 #SocialDistancing #tfl see what this week brings 🌈
Hopefully people have got the message. Sadly, there will still be the minority that think this is all a joke #COVIDIOTS #StayAtHomeSaveLives #COVIDー19 #coronavirus

Please take precautions against #coronavirus &amp; save yourself in order to save others around you. Events &amp; gatherings can take place later. Please stay home &amp; isolate yourselves just for a few days.
For all I know I am a carrier #coronavirus no symptoms bit hearing can still be a carrier
So even though this social distancing has just barely started to work and it’s ending?????? Ok #COVID19 #SocialDistancing
I have already called it for weeks. You can ban football matches but it wouldn't make a difference if the public transport is still running. The reduced services makes it worse when more ppl are packed in trains running at lower frequencies. #COVID19 #UKLockdownNow
The problem with this country, is that we don't take anything seriously. We didn't take Brexit seriously, we didn't take the general election seriously, when voting. Now, we don't take #COVID19 seriously. Wake the fuck up people - this is not a joke! #StayAtHome
Now have clear evidence from Italy that shutdown works. US would have egg on face if Europe contains and we let it go crazy. Need full country quarantine for two weeks and then back to business. #coronavirus #covid #RightWingMinorityOpinion
My pre-shift download yesterday. Preparing wills and decontamination routines. We need worker protections for healthcare professionals as well as all front-line workers who will keep us all safe during this outbreak. #StayHome #COVID19 #GetMePPE

Honestly, no one is taking any notice of staying in. I thought the elderly were not allowed out? They’re out in droves. It’s the old fuckers that are spreading it. They think they’re immune #shamblesstayathome #Coronavid19 #coronavirusuk #COVID19 #coronavirus

you’d think the NHS that everyone is praising at the moment would atleast provide doctors and healthcare nurses with clothing that reduces their risk of catching it but nah they expect my mum to continue working.. whereas the logic? #coronavirus #COVIDー19 #NHSstaffJust stay at home. 14days only guys. 	#COVID19 #prayformalaysia #StayHome

Self-quarantine feeds my anxiety, but what absolutely makes my anxiety sky rocket is the thought that this president could just undo it all in a week for the sake of the economy, ignoring the fact that the economy will crash if we undo it all. #COVID19 #StayHome
The President and GOP lawmakers calling on workers to go back to work after next week is an insane policy. Not only will it result in a vastly higher death toll than sustained shelter-in-place, the economy will STILL tank if millions get sick. #COVID19

My sister’s co-worker said a lady in our city posted online she has #coronavirus. Our friend who works at our CVS confirmed &amp; forwarded the post. The lady came into contact with at least 14 people. WTF. It’s freakin’ scary. 🤦🏻‍♀️🦠 #StayAtHome #StayHome #selfisolation

Chatted with some religious people and they strongly believe that religion can protect them from Covid19. Yes/maybe but extra caution won’t hurt. It’s time we use social influencers such as religious, indigenous leaders, etc to convey the safety message #SocialDistancing #COVID19
Italy has the worlds 2nd best health care system where india ranked at 112th.	Just Imagine the consequences if you don't lockdown. 	So its better to stay in your home for the next 10 days.	#StayAtHomeSaveLives	#CoronavirusPandemic #Covid19India

In the US, young Americans are getting sick too. 12% of intensive care patients are 20-44 years. Patients are between 20-54 in hospitalizations. Young people can get it ! 53% of cases in NY are people from ages 18-49. We are all at risk #StayHome #coronavirus #COVID19 #usa

So I lost my job/s because of #COVID19. And knowing that theres no job anymore and still finishing the final shift was pretty bad feeling. As long as everyone is safe and this thing calms down, I think I am ok with it. No income but yes I will be ok. #australialockdown

Distance is power against #COVID19!  #StayHome and do your part to help stop this thing in its tracks!  1st responders &amp; all those on the front lines need you to!  Feel helpless? Want to do something? THIS is how you will make a difference!  Be the example!
I think it might help if people either 65+ or younger but medically compromised to share #AtRisk &amp; say why they need EVERYONE to stay home to help people understand. People may not realize who they are putting at risk around them.		#COVID19 #COVID #StaySafe #StayAtHomeSaveLives
The rhetoric of it being a good thing that it takes more confirmed cases in the US before we even match the number of deaths of other countries is appalling. 		That does not make it okay to ease on our response to this outbreak. 		#SocialDistancing #covid19 #Coronavirus #StayHome

Ok. So we are self-isolating and staying at home, playing our parts. What's the government doing in their part - apart from quarantining? Or are we just gonna all come out of self-isolation in 2-3weeks, and boom! We were all safe again? #COVID19 #Coronavirustoronto
My true talent of being a homebody is absolutely paying off now.  Years of preparation and now I can shine!!! #StayAtHome #COVID19 #ihavenolife
Some people just don’t get it! Social distancing means stay the fuck home and only interact with those in your immediate household and only go out when absolutely necessary. If you’re still going out to hang out with your friends to habe fun, you’re part of the problem!! #COVID19
To anyone not self-isolating.		I blame you if you ruin my summer plans of pints in beer gardens...... 		The quicker we begin self to self isolate the quicker this all ends.		Don't make this stretch on longer than necessary		#COVID19ireland #Coronavirus
#ukcoronavirus #UKGoverment the government is still not serious they should close essential and non essential and provide for people whatever they need there is a way Uk is a stable country please lockdown everything this way we can save life’s #CoronavirusBillUK #coronavirus
Highly disappointed in Africans in general, why am I still seeing people going to clubs and restaurants to flex on IG? 		It was all shits &amp; giggles when we told ourselves that black people cannot be infected by #COVID19 but NEWSFLASH, we are not immune.
We can’t just give up on social distancing, but we can’t let the economy collapse. In cases like these, we need a strong, measured response from our government. #government #economy #COVID19
Yo I’m showing myself so much love right now.. I’m trying to get right for when quarantine is over! #coronavirus #COVID19 #QuarantineLife #LockdownNow #KungFluFighting #StayAtHomeSaveLives #WhereIsFauci
Dear everyone, because schools and offices have been shot down does not mean it’s time for hospital check-up,kindly stay at home if it’s not a severe case. I can’t believe amidst the #covid19 out break people are still flooding the hospital for reasons best known to them. Smh
If you're getting in your car for things other than food, work, medical or anything essential, please get back in your house. Just think The Nightstalker Serial Killer/The Smoke Monster/The Boogeyman is on the loose and you need to stay safe indoors. #COVID19 #SocialDistancing
There’s nothing more profound than being part of something greater than oneself. I’m amazed by the courage, selflessness, &amp; determination of my fellow health care profs in battling #coronavirus . Every day we go to work is just as imp as every day that you choose to stay home. 🙏🏽

Every day, more and more places are closing. It is so important for everyone to take COVID-19 seriously and stay home and keep your distance. Don’t go out unless you have to. The only way this ends is if we all do this. #coronavirus #StayHome
Gonna go have a drink(s) and a panic attack in the shower. 🥴💞🍹🍸🥃		And yet, I am very grateful #Inslee took this step. So many I have talked to think #CoronaVirus is still a joke. Well, noone is laughing in #Italy and #Spain you selfish assholes.

Unless you too can rise from the dead I suspect Easter will be a bad time to stop practicing social distancing and #coronavirus mitigation efforts.
Everyone, if walking along the road for exercise or to get essentials pls make #SocialDistancing easier by walking in the direction of the traffic where possible and remember what 2m looks like #CoronavirusLockdown #Covid19Out #COVID19 #coronavirus
My old dear is a recovering breast cancer victim. She is also a Nurse at East Surrey hospital (NHS), working as part of our front line staff tackling #COVID19. All the government are asking you to do is to #StayAtHome. Don’t be an ignorant moron! #StayAtHomeSaveLives
As a pharmacy tech that has patients, friends, &amp; family on forms of chloroquine/hydroxychloriquine for legitimate reasons, I'm gonna put this bluntly: folks taking/hoarding these medications &amp; the doctors prescribing them for off-label use to treat #COVID19  should be ashamed.
Help us &amp; the NHS save lives by staying at home. Essential travel only. Follow the government guidelines. We will be stopping people across our area &amp; challenging you to prove your reason for travelling and being out and about #StayAtHomeSaveLives #coronavirus #999onthefrontline

Can someone explain to our leaders that it's not considered shutdown/social distancing/reducing cross infection, if people are freely allowed to ride public transport/cars,leave their children to mingle at daycares &amp; kill time by multiple grocery store shopping trips #COVID19
It has been an #Emotional &amp; #Physical #Breaking say. The grocery worker in #Oshawa diagnosed with #COVID19 forced me to realize the risks my Mother is taking as a #GroceryCashier.  Also I've been #SelfIsolated for the last 12 days due to a fever at my last #PainClinic appt. 1/5
I have been sick for 14 days now, symptoms waxing and waning throughout, yesterday I felt like my lungs were filled with glass, it only improves when I take 500mg naproxen and even then I can still feel it. I still can’t get tested.  #coronavirus #COVID19

Only in the #Philippines. A Senator who’s positive with #COVID19 didn’t give a rat’s ass about #quarantinePh and went to the hospital’s delivery room with his pregnant wife and sister in law. To hell with other people he endangered, he wanted to go. Shame on you! Burn in hell!
Dr. Devi Shetty on CNBC interview says there will be at least 80000 positive cases in Karnataka alone in next 10-12 days. If we aren’t serious about Social Distancing then we are fucked. #CoronavirusLockdown #CoronavirusPandemic
I don't understand the point of shutting all these different places down for 14 days, when there is still a lot of places open. They need to shut everything down  besides grocery stores, drugstores, gas stations, and the LCBO so the ladies can get their wine! #COVID19

The best solution to fight the #COVID19 pandemic in Cameroon is a total lockdown. If things get worse, we neither have the infrastructure, nor the money, nor the expertise, and looking at the behavior of some top state officials, we might not even have the goodwill to fight it.
I just realized today that the #covid19 Global Pandemic is the world’s longest and worst game of ‘The floor is lava’.  Please, don’t leave your home unless you really need to.
Do not..I repeat do not get a prescription of #Plaquenil if you do not have an autoimmune disorder..you are only adding to the shortage problem! #Hydroxychloroquine It is not yet known as a cure or prevention against #coronavirus!

We will all eventually be infected with #COVID19, short of having a vaccine available. The point is to decrease the rate of spread, and avoid exposing those most vulnerable. That’s what #FlattenTheCurve means, and why #PPENow for healthcare workers is an absolute necessity.
If you find that Government guidance is not clear, just use common sense. It’s not difficult. #staysafe #StayAtHome #COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown #commonsense
TRAVELLERS: you MUST quarantine for 14 days!! there are people who think they’re safe because they don’t have symptoms, and still go to grocery stores. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. having no symptoms for a week doesn’t rule you out and there’s EVIDENCE BEHIND THAT. #COVID19 #COVIDOntarioThey should put a clause in this new stimulus package that you have to believe the Coronavirus is real to receive a check 🤷🏼‍♀️ #coronavirus #COVID19

It’s 2020 and if you don’t use an app to purchase meals, ie Starbucks or Chickfila, etc., you’re increasing your risk of contracting ANY illness, not just #COVID19 and increasing your chances of passing an illness. Do the world a favor, cause I really enjoy Starbucks.
Can only imagine how angry the families of #coronavirus victims must feel knowing that someone passed that on just by selfishly not following advice ☹️#StayAtHomeSaveLives

I decree this the "Boy Who Cried Wolf" era. No one took #COVID19 and #socialdistancing seriously because it was the 69th thing that was THE END OF THE WORLD since 2010. SARS, H1N1, Democrats, Ebola,  ISIS, Republicans, etc. When everything is an emergency, eventually nothing is.
Transitioning to a mainly work from home basis on Friday (with the except of essential mouse tasks every few days). I’ve been in denial about this reality. Never did I imagine this would happen in my first 6 months as faculty. But we all must do our part to reduce #coronavirus

ANY BETS THAT THE USA OPENS BACK UP FOR BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE ALL MIGHTY DOLLAR AND THROWS OUT REGARD FOR OUR HEALTH???  #coronavirus #COVID19 #WeWillSurvive #BeSmart
STAY at HOME Please.....	#COVID19
The amount of people still not taking #COVID19 serious is just frustrating. Care about your family, friends and your neighbors! Think about how much it would hurt you if someone you loved got sick and didn’t recover. Everyone has that person. Be the change even if it’s small.
Can USA please follow Taiwan’s approach and directions to combating the coronavirus and any viruses out there. #TaiwanNo1 #CCPVirus #COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown
I try not to judge people anymore, but if you're not a healthcare professional, please... don't post a photo wearing a N95 mask. You should've donated it to those who really need it. They told us it doesn't help us. They told us not to buy them. #coronavirus #HealthcareHeroes
It has reached my circle. A family friend was put on a ventilator this afternoon. Take this seriously. Stay the fuck home. Don’t be selfish. #StayHome #ShelterInPlace #coronavirus #COVID19
We have people complaining about no lockdowns on the entire country/their own states.	But think about this.	This disease is spreading only because YOU decide whether you get out of your house and go out in public or not.	And you’re deciding to go out.	#covid19 #coronavirus #usa
People aren’t gonna take this quarantine serious until the rona starts hitting close to home and by then I just hope it’s not too late for y’all 😣 #StayHome #COVID19
I’m getting so mad at people who are seeing their partners who they don’t live with. I’m not seeing mine to slow down the spread of this disease and protect many lives as possible. 		Do the same, so we can see our loved ones quicker! #CoronavirusLockdownUK #COVID19
FINALLY! Work has allowed us to go home and not come in anymore due to #COVID19 .. #stayathome #workfromhime
P/2 anyone of those people could be transmitting the virus to the staff and in reverse, then return home to families an spread it a bit more. #StayAtHome AND SHUT THE SHOP. Seems all you want to do is sell cakes than save lives. #CoronavirusLockdown #COVID19 #coronavirusuk
We need massive #COVID19 testing &amp; supportive isolation to stop spread. Massively produce medical supplies at cost. Ban profiteering &amp; engage in int'l cooperation, lift all sanctions so every country can heal its people. And give every person money to live now! #BailOutPeople
How can this country want a full lockdown but yous lot are still fucking abusing that by doing bbqs in parks and sunbathing on a green with a dozen crack heads? #COVID2019 #21daylockdown #coronavirus #panicbuying

Looking forward to the day when this is all over. We'll go to church, hug, shake hands. Do all of those things that we used to take for granted. But while we're in this season let's make the most of it. Study the Word, spend time in prayer, draw closer to family. #COVID19

Someone just held the door for me for few more seconds—so that I don’t need to hold the door handles. In time like now, this is a very act of kindness. #Covid19 #hkDidn't realise #contagionmovie was on TV tonight. Watched it on dvd.	Scarily accurate. #coronavirus 		Same advice: social distancing.

I agree with the #RiversState Govt &amp; other states that have taken this route. The next step should be a two or three week #StayAtHome order. Emergency equipment &amp; supplies will be let in under strict control as is done worldwide. 	#LockdownNigeriaNow #COVID19 #SocialDistancing

Once we flatten the curve, people will loose that awareness of basic measures to protect themselves like washing hands, keeping distance, etc and this will result in another curve just like what Britain is experiencing.	#COVID19
This #coronavirus is very serious man.. the fact we ain’t taking it serious.. is scary.
Honestly what I get from the daily #COVID19 briefings is: because Americans basically cannot understand.  This is a bad bad bad flu.  Sir your ass in your house.  And lock the Gd Door.
While the leaders are thinking to lockdown their respect nations, US at large is thinking to lockdown Trump. 		#21daysLockdown #StayHomeStaySafe #CoronavirusOutbreak

One of my new favorite parts of the weekend is not having to wash my hands 50 times a day. #covid19 #StayHome
The American people are catching on. Money is not wealth. Money is a measurement of wealth. We’ll have dollars in the same way that we’ll have inches. #CoronaLockdown #StayAtHomeAndStaySafe #TigerKingNetflix #COVID19
To all the people who are still going for morning walks outside your home:	You don't see the irony when you say you are trying to stay healthy! 	#COVID2019india #Covid_19india #corona #COVID19 #StayHomeStaySafe #COVIDIDIOTS
You can't go back and change the past, so look to the future and don't make the same mistake twice.	#StayAwareStaySafe #COVID2019 #coronavirus #lockdown
Had to go sit in the bathroom at work and cry tonight.	The company I work for is putting out ads encouraging people to come to their stores and buy stuff right now.	I'm angry.	I'm so fucking scared.	Fuck why won't this be over?? #COVID19 #coronavirus
Every moment of prayer should be cherished and enjoyed as we get to open our hearts before our Lord. #humanity #CoronavirusOutbreak #LockdownForLove #AhmadiYouth
In this situation of lockdown we are taking all the  necessary steps to prevent #COVID19 likewise social distancing, staying at home but we are not getting expected support from govt. Govt must provide basic things to citizens at their doorsteps in order to make this LD a success
#COVID19 	Corona update (28.3.2020: 8.30 am)	Five from Mumbai	One from Nagpur	Total cases 159		Stay Safe, Stay Home	#WarAgainstVirus	#MaharashtraFightsCorona
Best thing I did for my relationship is to open up in sex #factoftheday #COVID19 #StayAtHomeAndStaySafe #stayhome
My father nearly died in the Sea of Japan in WWII. I think I can watch Netflix. Get a grip. Do your job! #CoronaLockdown #COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak
You are risking lives!! What for exactly? Is it money?? Does one of your family members have to get sick in order for you to understand the risks you’re taking with TN’s lives?? #COVID19 #ShutItDownNow
#coronavirus is no joke. I feel so badly I’m shaking. I can’t keep anything down, I switch between being too cold or too cold (there is no in between) stay the fuck home
#COVID19 so glad my test came back #negative will still practice #socialdistancing and #staythefuckathome as I’m very immunosuppressed and want to live!!
You’re not STUCK at home,	You’re SAFE at home!	1 word can change your attitude,	1 cough could change your life.	#COVID19 #PlankTheCurve #PhysicalDistancing
Forget the army		Forget the celebs and politicians		If you still believe this is media driven hype, you are basically some kind land trout with with doggy doo for brains.		They’re building morgues you f’ing idiots!! #COVID19 #UK #Q
It is really hard when your great-grandmother wants you to come visit her. But being considered a "essential employee" in the community...I just can't risk it. #coronavirus #NCLockdown #restaurantworker
It’s not the time to be such a smarta**. Stay home and stay alive! 	#LockDownNasionalSerentak 	#CoronaUpdate 	#CoronaIndonesia 	#COVID19 	#COVID19indonesia 	#DiRumahAjaYa
To anyone that has lost somebody they love due to the #Coronavirus I send my deepest most sincere condolences😔. Everybody please be safe &amp; take this shit seriously! We're all in this together we ALL got to love each other as fellow Americans &amp; human beings!
It is most painful situation to be in that one of your family member is dying and you know you can not help or meet them. He dies without goodbye. 	Worst is still to come to us. Let’s prevent it before it’s too late.	Stay home and stay safe.	#CoronavirusOutbreak .
Can everyone just stay the fuck home so I can have a hot girl summer. Thank you. #COVID19 #CoronaLockdown #Covid19usa
Finna call the damn police these bitches outside bumpin boosie in the RONA 🦠 it’s passed curfew.... #COVID19
Great news, everyone! I’ve asked myself to dinner and I said yes!!!	#QuarantineLife #ShelterAtHome #CoronaLockdown #COVID19 #QuaratineAndChill
I live in a rural community, a block from our hospital. Ambulance sirens seem frequent. #CoronaLockdown #coronavirus #StayHome n
#coronavirus  pandemic proved that humanity in big shit (gran mierda).	People spreading the virus deliberately, others refusing the isolation or quarantine, other hoarding on supplies and scumbags are stealing. 	What is this?	#CoronaLockdown 	#COVID19 	#CoronavirusOutbreak
Provision of free hand sanitizers, distribution of free nose masks to the market men and women won't be a bad start. Intervention centers properly equipped should be made available and their locations made known to the public.	#COVID19 	#StayAtHomeAndStaySafe 	#AbiaState
Please a total lock down Mr. President for two weeks and quick! We can tell..I am from the Netherlands Mr. Trump. Help your people like a true leader should do. #coronavirus #VS
Here’s an obvious tip, when showing footage on news services of pre this virus outbreak. Maybe a banner or something. Because when you see people shaking hands, kissing &amp; hugging maybe just maybe you’re sending confusing messages to people watching the news #coronavirus #skynews
If you’re self-isolating due to Coronavirus, or consider yourself vulnerable, and are in need of anything. We have volunteers who can help.#ahmdiyouth #covid19
#COVID19 updating data in the world, not fully updated????😭😭😭😭😭😭	May Allah have mercy on us and our dear family and loved once #StayAtHomeAndStaySafe #StaySafeNigeria #davido #chefchi #CoronavirusOutbreak
Should we start a GoFundMe to help buy ventilators for the hospitals in states where elected officials don't kiss Trump's ass?		We can't do nothing and let people die because the president is a narcissistic sociopath. 		#Covid_19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #StayHome
To be afraid in #QuarantineDays or not to be ? That is the question!!! Don’t be! 🦠🤛🏻#Covid_19 #TogetherWeFightCorona #SocialDistancing #lovelive #WashYourHands
How is your mental during this time? #CoronavirusOutbreak #CoronaLockdown #StayHome #coronavirus
This is just my opinion, but why hasn’t air traffic been suspended entirely? Planes are how #COVID19 is being spread and travelled. #CoronaLockdown #StayHome #COVIDCanada
