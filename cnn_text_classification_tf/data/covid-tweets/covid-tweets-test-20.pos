I am trying to not let this whole #CoronavirusPandemic get me riled up. But I will say this, it is ok to be concerned for the people in your community who are 65+ reach out to them, help them, be a good person &amp; wash your hands people!!!!! Ok thanks for listening to my Lilli Talk
Is it just me.... or does it feel like Earth is living paycheck to paycheck right now??? #CoronavirusPandemic
All activities at Warwick‚Äôs senior centers will be postponed for at least two weeks in accordance with the guidelines issued today to protect adults over age 60, who are especially at risk for #Covid_19.

Reality Check: COVID-19 does not watch/read the news. So whatever spin or rose colored glasses are put on, it is a virus so it does not care. #CoronavirusPandemic #pandemic
SOCIAL DISTANCING #COVID19
(2/3) Maximum cases are people with a travel history to infected countries and ofcourse Italians. 65 infected and 0 deaths for a billion people is simply amazing statistics.		Can someone figure out why the #CoronavirusOutbreak hasn't hit India as hard as other nations?
This past week has literally felt like a nightmare. #CoronavirusPandemic
Hey, *45, the noise is coming from inside the house. üëèMAKEüëèTESTSüëèAVAILABLEüëè Test anyone and everyone who needs it. Release real numbers. Share real information. Lives are at risk. Listen to science. Stop the nonsense. #COVID19 #TESTVIRUSNOW
Sports is done for awhile. Face it. And it stinks. #CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19Hey people, no need to panic. Just practice proper hygiene. If you have a chronic illness, stay away from people. Don't visit our seniors in long-term care facilities. They're vulnerable. JUST USE COMMON SENSE and stop hoarding TP and Lysol wipes. #Covid_19 #CoronavirusPandemic
I for one am looking forward to hunkering down with my family for awhile. We‚Äôre lucky enough to have our health and a big family that all gets along. We may not be together like this 4 long. 		We will happily do our part to protect those at risk. 		#covid19 #pandemic #ShutItDown
Any Medical experts out there? If you contract Covid-19 today, when next season arrives, can we get it again? #Coronavirus #Covid_19 #doctors #nurses
This seems extreme but it's effective in stopping the spread of the virus. I'm going crazy tbh having my freedom taken away but what can ya do. Just letting you know that this might be your situation also..hopefully not, just be prepared. #coronavirus
Pandemic #coronavirus will give us a great lesson that we are weak creatures, but also the strogest ones as if we unite and hold on all together.		Our enemy is not between us, but something outside humanity which actually we ourselves have made.		Stay strong!
We have to pray and unite as one during the  #CoronavirusPandemic. When schools close, some children will go hungry. When places close, some people will not get paid. We need to support and love one another.

Gas prices going down is not a good thing, guys... hundreds, if not thousands, of oil field families are losing their jobs and subsequently their livelihood. This #Covid_19 virus isn‚Äôt just effecting folks through contracting illness. Worldwide spread panic is also a virus.
Don‚Äôt make patients pay for virus tests and treatment. People with lower incomes will be deterred from seeking treatment if they face health care costs, worsening the epidemic. #COVID19
Okay UK, the #Covid19 #coronavirus infection rates are going up and it‚Äôs getting widespread amongst the population. If you haven‚Äôt already it‚Äôs time to #ISOLATEtheELDERLY Get anyone older or frail to isolate now whilst it spreads through the young and healthy #herdimmunity

Everyone needs to understand the basic principles of public health, particularly that health is social. #COVID19 is showing that we have a long way to go on this front. This is so important that basic public health needs to be incorporated into every high school curriculum.

Dear Everone. Wash your hands, stay calm and stay healthy. Act, don't overreact. #Covid_19 is something to take serious, but if we can work together and share our soaps and hand sanitizers (and apparently T.P) then the mortality rate will remain 2 per 100,000 #COVID19 #Facts

The media has incentive to sensationalize #COVID19 but these "red pill" mfs saying ignore this disease while ignoring death rates for at-risk populations like the elderly and the immunocompromised.

I'm frustrated by the prevalence of people spewing what they "believe" about #COVID19 publicly. This isn't a religious ideology. Science trumps your beliefs. Over 470 people died in Italy today, this is more dangerous than the flu.
1)Private/public medical universities hospitals can be declared as quarantine ,  2)Governor houses,State guests houses &amp; 5 star hotels can be taken over for keeping critical patients, Khan must act NOW along with all CMs to safeguard nation from #CoronaVirus
The best way to control the spread of #COVID19 is: 1. Pray vigoursly to seek forgiveness and protection from God. 2. Adopt cleanliness measures to the extent as if u have the virus to protect others from it and as if everyone else have a virus  to protect yourselves from it.
I have all the symptoms of the #coronavirus (I feel absolutely dreadful &amp; yes I‚Äôm self-isolating) but how do I know that it‚Äôs not just the flu? I quarantine myself for 2 weeks and then head back out into the world to only catch something I thought I‚Äôd already had? #COVID19

I am not at all thrilled with Japan‚Äôs response to the #COVID19  pandemic. Apart from the closing of schools, it is business as usual... packed malls/bars &amp; crowded trains. Testing is hard to come by. Only govt facilities offer the test but only if high fever for 4 straight days.I couldn‚Äôt brain how some people can lied about being contacted with a positive #COVID19 just to live like a normal people and spreading the virus to the others. How could you be so heartless and selfish? At this tough time, it reveals how truly Malaysians are, disappointing!
Per the state mandate: Schuham will be closed until it is safe to resume business. Be safe and be well. #COVID19 #business

Regardless of if commencement is canceled, I won‚Äôt be walking. I had every intention to, but #COVID19 put into perspective not only the cost to one‚Äôs health but also the cost to walk across a stage for a piece of paper &amp; a photo. That one moment doesn‚Äôt negate the work I put in.
I was told not to come to work for 7 days because I‚Äôve been in close contact with a coworker who has tested positive for #COVID19 . 		Tishman Speyer is the worst company I‚Äôve ever worked for. As of this time, #RockefellerCenter buildings are open, and I do not know why.

I'm so glad I live in the UK and we have the NHS because in America it looks like truly a shit show #coronavirus #coronavirusuk
Please take precautions against #coronavirus &amp; save yourself in order to save others around you. Events &amp; gatherings can take place later. Please stay home &amp; isolate yourselves just for a few days.
Lol close EVERYTHING for a month!!! #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus
I stay in the house the weekend because I'm afraid to infection #coronavirus. But  in #Japan, some people go to hang out. I think it's depends on us that is whether coronavirus can to end. So, I think they should have awareness of crisis more and stay in the house.üè†		#Japanese
UK now on lockdown for 3 weeks, wonder if any of the people who still work with around 200+ people walking in and out will receive any pay in which to cover the hazard risk of being exposed too all of this at all? Especially the NHS and Supermarkets #coronavirus #UKLockdownNow
Would really appreciate it if people who have been able to live a carefree life think about those who can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt if you keep being selfish. #shutdownflorida #HighRiskCovid19 #COVID19 #StayHomeSaveLives
Part 4: Since the U.S. and Canada have agreed to lockdown their borders due to the #Coronavirus, perhaps it's time for us here in the U.S. to consider locking down our nation altogether, and give a 1-week notice to Americans abroad to return home, to prevent any further outbreak.
Stay the fuck home guys. #COVIDIDIOTS #COVID19 #StayAtHomeSaveLives
We all have a responsibility that we met fulfill in the next few months. I urge everyone to follow through with the measures set in place by our government #COVID„Éº19 #StayAtHomeSaveLives #coronavirus
Tales from a first responder/ health care worker at the front of the #COVID19 pandemic: 		Social distancing is still not stopping strangers from asking me to look at a mole on their groin in the gas station bathroom.
And in #India nearly 17-18 million people died during the #SpanishFlu in 1918, which was almost 6% of its population. Highest among the nations. Think about it, #staysafe and #StayHome. #COVID19 #WHO #lockdown #CoronavirusOutbreak #pandemic
There are seniors I put midst whose respirators will be removed and given to young people who were partying on the beaches just one week ago. Let that sink in. #coronavirus

We are all getting done over by the most microscopic piece of bacteria because people are stupid and won‚Äôt stay in their house and then putting others and the more vulnerable at risk... the world is full of selfish peopleüò¢ #coronavirus #covidiotsSo I lost my job/s because of #COVID19. And knowing that theres no job anymore and still finishing the final shift was pretty bad feeling. As long as everyone is safe and this thing calms down, I think I am ok with it. No income but yes I will be ok. #australialockdown

Chatted with some religious people and they strongly believe that religion can protect them from Covid19. Yes/maybe but extra caution won‚Äôt hurt. It‚Äôs time we use social influencers such as religious, indigenous leaders, etc to convey the safety message #SocialDistancing #COVID19

End of day for #COVID19 new cases is here: US daily growth was 29.7%, down from 38.7% yesterday. A lot better than I expected. 		Must keep going. We will get to the end of this nightmare together.		#StayHome
Really want to throat punch my brother and sister in law. They are not taking self isolation seriously, at all, and are endangering my nephew aka my favorite human on the GD planet. We're in Florida and most Floridians also aren't taking this shit seriously. #COVID19 #StayHome
Don't go out stay home stay safe #COVID19
I can't decide what im more outraged about at the moment. The spring break idiots or the parents who named their kid Dick Pound.  #COVIDIOTS #IOC #coronavirus
We can‚Äôt just give up on social distancing, but we can‚Äôt let the economy collapse. In cases like these, we need a strong, measured response from our government. #government #economy #COVID19
I haven‚Äôt left my house in 5 days, which really isn‚Äôt that long yet, but I think it‚Äôs actually the longest time I‚Äôve ever done that in my adult life. Might as well set a personal record. #COVID19 #StayHome
I really wish all counties in Houston would put out a "Stay at home" order. I live in #galvestoncounty but work in #Harriscounty so now I'm all sorts of confused. #coronavirus #COVID19 #Texas
Some people just don‚Äôt get it! Social distancing means stay the fuck home and only interact with those in your immediate household and only go out when absolutely necessary. If you‚Äôre still going out to hang out with your friends to habe fun, you‚Äôre part of the problem!! #COVID19We will all eventually be infected with #COVID19, short of having a vaccine available. The point is to decrease the rate of spread, and avoid exposing those most vulnerable. That‚Äôs what #FlattenTheCurve means, and why #PPENow for healthcare workers is an absolute necessity.
I'm watching the news: they're juxtaposing footage of Mayor Garcetti &amp; Gov. Newsome (asking people to stay indoors) with footage of CROWDS of people playing soccer at a park and another group skating in Venice. I am beyond furious with the selfish people. #COVID19 #StayHome

I don't understand the point of shutting all these different places down for 14 days, when there is still a lot of places open. They need to shut everything down  besides grocery stores, drugstores, gas stations, and the LCBO so the ladies can get their wine! #COVID19
Dr. Devi Shetty on CNBC interview says there will be at least 80000 positive cases in Karnataka alone in next 10-12 days. If we aren‚Äôt serious about Social Distancing then we are fucked. #CoronavirusLockdown #CoronavirusPandemic

TIL the doctors at my wife‚Äôs OB office are each on-call 1 day of the week for ALL deliveries that day to limit bodies in the hospital. If 1 of them catches #COVID19 they ALL have to quarantine as they work daily out of the same office out of the hospital. So please, stay home.
Colorado mandates all non CRITICAL businesses to shut down and a stay home order is in place tomorrow morning. Gues who‚Äôs job refuses to close because they‚Äôre exempt, MINE I still have to deliver you assholes pizza and risk my health doing so it I‚Äôll be fired. #coronavirus #fuck

It‚Äôs 2020 and if you don‚Äôt use an app to purchase meals, ie Starbucks or Chickfila, etc., you‚Äôre increasing your risk of contracting ANY illness, not just #COVID19 and increasing your chances of passing an illness. Do the world a favor, cause I really enjoy Starbucks.
The amount of people still not taking #COVID19 serious is just frustrating. Care about your family, friends and your neighbors! Think about how much it would hurt you if someone you loved got sick and didn‚Äôt recover. Everyone has that person. Be the change even if it‚Äôs small.
As we exercise all caution, keeping social distance, regularly washing hands with soap or sanitizing, staying at home, let us all remember that Him who loved us has declared us more than conquerors!	So Lesotho shall remain with 0 "official" and 0 "unofficial" #COVID19 cases!

But my 74-year-old uncle, had a scheduled, non-emergent surgery today. This took a person from a high-risk group, out of his safe home, to a high-risk place, using a bed, further overworking the already overburdened staff, and requiring the use of precious PPE.		#COVID19 ü¶†
