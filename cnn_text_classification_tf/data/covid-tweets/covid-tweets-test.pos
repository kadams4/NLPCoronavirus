I understand schools/companies need to shut down due to the #CoronavirusOutbreak but i cannot afford to live if I am not able to work
Hey, *45, the noise is coming from inside the house. üëèMAKEüëèTESTSüëèAVAILABLEüëè Test anyone and everyone who needs it. Release real numbers. Share real information. Lives are at risk. Listen to science. Stop the nonsense. #COVID19 #TESTVIRUSNOW
This past week has literally felt like a nightmare. #CoronavirusPandemic
(2/3) Maximum cases are people with a travel history to infected countries and ofcourse Italians. 65 infected and 0 deaths for a billion people is simply amazing statistics.		Can someone figure out why the #CoronavirusOutbreak hasn't hit India as hard as other nations?
I really need to know the situation at the US border campa regarding the #CoronavirusPandemic Weren't people dying of the flu there already? What's going to happen to these people now??
If you say the coronavirus is dumb or over talked about then you need to educate yourself! It is still a deadly virus!ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Man people these days are... idk if it‚Äôs the things happening in 2020 is worse or the people! #Covid_19 #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemicWill the coronavirus keep you from going out to eat?? My answer is yes #coronavirus
I‚Äôm worried about my ability to pay a security deposit when my current lease ends. I‚Äôm losing my health insurance, I‚Äôm worried about affording my prescriptions. I‚Äôm so. F*cking. Angry.		/2		#CoronavirusPandemic 	#CoronaOutbreak
Pandemic #coronavirus will give us a great lesson that we are weak creatures, but also the strogest ones as if we unite and hold on all together.		Our enemy is not between us, but something outside humanity which actually we ourselves have made.		Stay strong!
Just a reminder: please be kind to your health care providers #CoronavirusPandemic #fluseason #overwhelmed
#Coronavirus y‚Äôall need to stop buying everything. Some people actually don‚Äôt have anything yet. I have been looking for hand sanitizer and masks for over 2 weeks now, and still everything is always outta stock. Get what you really need. Don‚Äôt take the whole store. üòïüòïüòï
I am talking to so many people at work who have #COVID19 symptoms who are being told they will not qualify for testing for various "reasons." They're told to self-quarentine by their Dr's. We truly dont know the extent of this because of the lack of testing!Gas prices going down is not a good thing, guys... hundreds, if not thousands, of oil field families are losing their jobs and subsequently their livelihood. This #Covid_19 virus isn‚Äôt just effecting folks through contracting illness. Worldwide spread panic is also a virus.
Trying to figure out this social distancing thing while teaching and working in high school. #coronavirus
Almost a week on, and based on the latest data, the % of #COVID19 positive tests per day has gone up to 6%, nearly 2X where it was last week. At this rate we can expect UK cases to reach approx. 4,800 next Sunday.
Without preexisting conditions the rate of death for those sick with #Covid_19 is .9% but with preexisting conditions this go to a 600-1000% higher chance of death if contracting #Covid_19 !
Why You need government to isolate regular life and activities??		Don't be stupid. ... 	Isolate yourself , Think before you go out, or meet people.. be a responsible family member, Stay safe and take care of your love once. 	#coronavirus #COVID19
Myself and my colleagues are operating business as normal providing not only regular blood and specimen testing but testing for #COVID19. I work with a wonderful bunch of scientists who have worked continuously through storms, snows and now a pandemic to ensure the patient isTo the asshole who showed up to our store wearing a mask and pretending to cough whenever you walked by somebody: fuck you. Go home. The #coronavirus isn't a joke. If I wasn't required to work, I'd be home self distancing.
Calling all cyclists out there. Now more than ever we need to stick together, respect one another and remain positive. These tough times will pass and we will ride shoulder to shoulder again #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus #KeepCalm
And w/the official pres address we‚Äôre off to the races w #CoronaVirus in SA: school closures, gatherings limited to 100, &amp; encouragement to stay home as much as possible. Worried for the underprivileged as they live day to day and can‚Äôt afford to not work. ‚ù§Ô∏è
If you‚Äôre self employed, how worried are you about your job and income?  #CoronaVirus
People need to be doing less worrying about why their child‚Äôs school isn‚Äôt closing &amp; more worrying about the zero discussion of testing and treatment. The virus has already spread.		#coronavirusaustralia #coronavirus #covid19 #COVID19Aus #ScottMorrison #scomo #auspol #Australia
I am not concerned about my recovery if I do contract #covid19 I am concerned about the rapid spread to others who cannot fight this disease. We need a shut down period. 		I also don‚Äôt want to go to work tomorrow. üôÇ
Maybe it's not all about how to not get infected by #COVID19. Just assume you're the carrier so you should lessen your touch to things, your travel, and contacts with people to slower the spread and no more COVID19 left in the world since the virus only have days to live.On my timeline I am trying to reflect the most accurate opinion &amp; information I am coming across. I am not intending to be alarmist or dramatic. I am truly incensed about the lack of government action at a time when prevention is so important to save lives. #coronavirus #coronaau
The spread of Covid-19 is out of control, we must postpone all primaries until this is under control. Knowing the American election system, these primaries will result in hundreds standing in lines for hours on end. This is definitely a disaster waiting to happen. #coronavirus

#Pakistan must declare a state of #emergency before the #coronavirus situation gets out of control.

Gotta shift our focus, IMHO*.		Less concern about getting #coronavirus test and more about following orders to #socialdistance and #stayhome. Test doesn‚Äôt cure. Assume everyone has it.		Social distancing and good hygiene are the spoonful of medicine we need.		*I‚Äôm not a doctor
Here‚Äôs a tip if you insist on going to a supermarket and queuing up. Place the length of the trolley between you and the person in front of you. That‚Äôs a nice distance so you at least put yourself at least risk. #SocialDistance #Covid_19
