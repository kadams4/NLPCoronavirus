If a vaccine for #COVID_19 was available, it would be a reasonable policy to try and vaccinate 60% of the population to create herd immunity. 	To simply allow 60% to contract the disease is not herd immunity it's a mass epidemic!

It makes me so mad to see any politician use this virus as a political ploy, especially our president.Also, our president had the nerve to call COVID-19 the China virus. What a disgrace of a human. Never been so ashamed to be an American. #COVID19
Pro Tip:  try to get away from the news/spend SOME time each day doing something that has nothing to do with #coronavirusIdc if you are Republican or Democrat...

One of the interesting things about #coronavirus and the healthcare system is that it shows you that even in a Capitalistic society we still have limited resources. Your accessibility to healthcare is still prioritized. You can still pay an arm and leg and be turned away.

$500 billion dollars to big business outta nowhere, but my idea for a Wu-Tang Research Center was too expensive and unnecessary? Meanwhile we could be stockpiled with Killa Beez bout to swarm on a virus, smh. #EachWuGetsABilliEach #TheProtectYaNeckPlan #coronavirus #Wutang
I'm about to use the wushi finger hold on #COVID19
For 108 years we have criticized the Titanic for not having enough life boat space for all passengers. 	However we, in 2020, live in a country with only 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 citizens.  	Side note: 31 other countries come ahead of us in beds per 1000  citizens. #COVID19
Got laid off this week, and I wanna say how thankful I am for the people around me who keep me up! Also actually thankful for the govt for once in actually getting this stimulus stuff done. If anyone needs a Digital Analyst, hit me up! #COVID19 #DigitalMarketing #jobless
I wish TikTok would get the #COVID19
It took a Pandemic to realize how many things I took for granted #CoronavirusOutbreak
This #coronavirusoutbreak is more stressful for the family. Doing my best to keep sanitized and safe. But, fear of the invisible killer lingers on, taking a mental toll on my mother, wife, son, who are petrified every time I walk out of the main door. #COVID19
#COVID19 got my sleeping pattern outta wack
Once this is over the, the super rich are going to be super duper rich. #COVID19
So #COVID19 is not completely ruled out for me. Pneumonia is getting no better in current antibiotics. What does this mean for me. 		More meds and back into full blown quarantine again. 		Someone kill me please.
After the dust settle from #COVID19 companies and corporation will going to invest heavy on #technology specially on #remotework and #BYOD
I know so many others are going through this too and it’s just awful. If anyone has any ideas or things they’ve done to get them through this time let me know 😭 #COVID19 #CoronaLockdown
Music is clutch #COVID19
Covid-19 showed, mother nature doesnt discriminate on basis of gene pool, religion, race, caste or creed. Next time you categorise humans remember its a figment of human imaginary boundaries #COVID19 #ChineseVirus19
Asian Americans, have you experienced any racist acts regarding #covid19? 		#poll #polls #covid #Covid_19 #coronavirus #CoronaLockdown #CoronaUpdate #COVIDIOT
Where the fuck is Sam and Dean Winchester? Because this got to be some Crowley shit!!  #Supernatural #2020 #coronavirus #bitchdontwearnoshoesinmyhouse #corona2020
I can't wait for #Quarantine to end so my family can leave the house and leave me alone 😂🤷🏻 #Covid_19
The talents that people have discovered within themselves through this #pandemic 🤯 #CoronaLockdown  #COVID19 #possibilitiesareendless
We have resources to fight wars but we don’t have resources for ventilators and PPEs. #COVID19

It's REALLY bothering me how folks are using #covid19 as an opportunity to completely DESTROY an entire group of people just because they belong to a certain political party. This goes for both sides of the aisle.		STOP IT.	PEOPLE ARE SICK, DYING, &amp; SUFFERING.  	WE CAN DO BETTER.
#COVID19 has given me so much health anxiety I literally can’t
Before #coronavirus did you tip for #takeout ?
WHY ARE YOU HASHTAGGING A PHOTO OF YOUR DOG ON IG WITH #COVID19
Is this the apocalypse and total world collapsed  #Covid_19 ?
Your delivery people remember you and may even remember where you live? Think twice before you skip the #Tips. We *do* flag bad customers and refuse orders from them in the future. Plus- if you skip tips during #CoVid19 you suck and shouldn’t be ordering #delivery.
The reason being quarantined doesn’t really phase me Is because during most of my junior and high school years I was grounded. I’ve trained for this like  it’s an Olympic event. #chynuhvirus #coronavirus  #iftheartofgettinggroundedwasasportingeventidbemichaeljprdan
I just ordered ice cream on uber eats. I’m trying to figure out if it’s a new high or new low 🤔#coronavirus #CoronaLockdown
