this mix made tasty , crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron , but the whole box only made 3 5 waffles this would be a five star product for me if i could get more than one family meal out of it for the price . 
both of our dogs are fed bil jac my older dog , dixie , loves this senior version it 's nutritionally dense , with meat as it 's primary ingredient and without empty fillers and fats dixie 's weight is easier to maintain with this formula , and she has the most marvelous shiny coat too . 
i love to feed my kids goats milk but to buy it fresh from the farm is so expensive , so this is a great substitute i started my kids on this when i stopped nursing and they 've loved it ever since they eat it in their cereal and drink it straight from the cup i think goats milk is the next best thing to breast milk ! . 
i like orange soda but usually cannot drink an entire can or bottle of sunkist or a href http www amazon com gp product b00168a9kg orange crush case 4 6pk a because they are so sickly sweet this has just the right touch of natural sweetness , and the tangerine gives a nice little tang to the orange flavor reminds me of the great orange sodas you can get in europe or specialty shops , like a href http www amazon com gp product b001gn4ohk orangina sparkling citrus beverage with natural pulp 24 cans a or a href http www amazon com gp product b0001fqucg san pellegrino aranciata 6 pack 6oz bottles a br br dare i say it \? yes the flavor and size make it a perfect mixer after my intial sip , i immediately thought it would be great to fill up the rest of the glass with vodka . 
i had been using a href http www amazon com gp product b000ubh9ye senseo decaffeinated coffee , 18 count pods \( pack of 6 \) a in my a href http www amazon com gp product b0043xylaa hamilton beach personal cup stay or go pod brewer a although the senseo coffee is very good , i wanted some variety this is what i found and its excellent the vanilla flavor is rich and most importantly , leaves no after taste i drink tall cups , 16 oz , so what i am doing is using 1 of each type the vanilla is strong enough that it still tastes great the senseo decaf is a little cheaper , so i do that as a cost saving measure i also signed up for subscribe and save to further reduce cost if you like vanilla coffee and have a pod brewer , i am confident you will love this coffee . 
this is one of the best choices , in my opinion i also adore amazon , but they need to negotiate a better price for their tassimo disks these are available at bedbath beyond for 10 and i always get 20 off which brings it down to 8 00 they were 7 50 \( before the 20 off readily available coupons \) until about 3 months ago again , this is an excellent blend with full flavor not bitter i think it 's my favorite . 
i rarely eat anything but whole wheat pasta , but every once in a while , i eat some of this as a treat almost as good as the pastas that i ate while in italy ! just make sure you do n't over cook . 
you can taste the wood in the respect it taste like the coffee was roasted over wood it is very smooth , i detect no bitterness or over roasting nice flavor my newest favorite amoung the k cup line my old favorite was donut shop but not any more i am not as pleased with the other caribou flavors but this one really surprised me . 
i bought this before i realized how much i was getting and before i knew they had it at the grocery store ! that was my own fault i really should have waited but the seeds are great , i just have way too many in my freezer ! . 
nice , smooth cup of joe high recommend not sure why there is not more reviews \? ! \? ! . 
i began purchasing this tea years ago and looked forward to it each year for the past two years i was unable to locate it in my local stores so i was elated to find it at amazon it tastes like cinnamon and red candy apples to me i love it ! . 
crackers are great was glad to find them there is a good selection of flavors my favorite is salted , but there are other choices . 
i drink this delicious tea almost every day i have yet to find anything like it on the market . 
i love coffee , but i also love not having to messing with the coffee maker sometimes this instant espresso is the best i have tried and i have tried about 7 different brands br br not overly acidic at all , melts instantly in hot water \( no sand dunes left swirling at the top if your cup \) , travels wonderfully \( compact jar \) and is very versitile to have around for cooking br br i but a tsp in a batch of brownies to deepen the dark chocolate flavor br br i put a tbs in a big batch of chili to compliment the spices and add extra richness br br i add a bit to mexican mole sauce for punch br br i also put it in chocolate granache icing , chai tea with milk for a java chai latte , coffee drink mixes for extra umph , etc br br it is over 5 bucks at some supermarkets , when if you can even find it , so it is nice to know it is cheaper at amazon ! . 
i like the ease of this mix i have n't tried anything but pancakes they were great ! i did add cottage cheese to my mix to add protein , which made them less fluffy but not less tasty i ca n't wait to try this mix for chicken i really miss fried chicken . 
a very nice flavor with no after taste it gives off a nice fragrance while brewing and has a very satisfying taste you have to have another cup ! . 
it was shipped in a very nice package and i have no complain with the seller my plant growing bigger and now i am looking for a bigger pot to transplant it 's good if you are looking for a a workspace plant that needs minimal maintenance this is the plant you might need . 
they taste so good easy on my stomach when i am running help keep my energy up on long runs love them ! ! ! . 
our dog loves these treats we sprinkle a few into his regular dry dog food , and he gobbles everything up as fast as he can we also use them as rewards for good behavior wonderful , nutritious , really good to have on hand at all times . 
each box is 8oz and usually i make 8oz mixed with some lean protein for a meal for both my husband and i , and if we have leftovers , it 's rare this time however , i had half of it leftover only b c we felt full and could n't eat anymore i wonder if this is b c of the high amt of fiber whatever , this morning my hubby tells me he 's down 3 lbs too i'm jealous also , i 've been on an eating binge almost 2 weeks , always feeling unsatiated last night i had no strong urges to eat snacks i ate an apple more out of habit to eat something than b c i was truly hungry i wo n't say this is the outcome for everyone , but i thought i 'd share i'm using the leftover pasta in my bean soup tonight i 'd like to eventually try the different varieties of shapes of pasta now , too . 
not much else to say i keep a box in my desk here at work , and i can enjoy a cup anytime ! nice flavor , and no bitterness , so i can drink it straight without sugar ! br br pros flavor and value br br cons it ca n't do my taxes for me that 's really about all i can think of lol . 
if you are a man this is the best you can do for your health , eat pumpkin seeds bob 's red mill has the best grown here in the good old usa the others are from china , enough said . 
i knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips the price per bag ca n't be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated . 
great snack and good on salads it 's dried peas , what else can i say \? . 
i am so happy to have bought this tumbler it is very handy to have around and works beautifully i whole heartedly recommend this product to anyone looking for a convenient tea making device i love the blooming bulbs and how you can see them while it brews ! \) . 
i love to eat pasta but totally clueless on how to make one saw this while at the grocery earlier , decided to try it , followed the instructions and viola one awesome dinner ! ! note i did add some parmesan and romano cheese to add more flavor . 
i use this for work it 's very quick and easy and much better than the vile coffee they provide br br i do n't understand the price though a 2 oz jar at whole foods was 4 49 well before the exp date . 
i have been using the product for several months now the dogs seem to like it and having it delivered is really nice what more can i say \? . 
add walnuts to this healthful brownie and perhaps a light iceing do not overback or it will be very dry lots of good stuff in this brownie , but the flax taste is a little strong i really feel no guilt when having a brownie snack for me or my kids . 
i have not eaten this popcorn or tasted it myself , it was part of a gift for my daughter in grad school she likes the fluffy quality of the popped corn and the not so many hulls also the big bag makes her think she can make it last until christmas \( that remains to be seen \) without having to buy more a very good snack for a poor grad student . 
wolfgang puck makes the best coffee ! the package arrived on time and in perfect condition ! i would definitely order this again . 
i got the coffee for 12 50 per box ordered 4 boxes ! ! such a great deal , as the coffee is a great blend br br if anyone is upset because of the website having issues when they were trying to buy it , they should n't review the product poorly , as it is not the product that is the problem br br the problem is that you 're jealous you did n't get such a great deal on the coffee grow up kids , this coffee is great ! ! ! will buy from amazon com , llc again for more k cups for my keurig br br all of my coffee arrived packaged well and in new condition , nothing wrong with it ! ! . 
i am very happy i switched from a very popular dog food , sold in a lot of vets offices to newmans about 3 years ago after a bout of stomach distress all has been well with my fur baby ever since \) and to have it brought right to my front door for cheaper than i can get it at the local store , how can you beat that \? . 
i love this coffee , its dark but not bitter and smooth as silk its a big cup size 12oz so its great in the morning when i do n't want to get up for coffee too much if you have a tassimo you should have this coffee blend on hand ! . 
this is a great coffee its dark but not bitter , a little chocolaty , and it reminds me of an adirondack lodge i can get them for a better price in a caribou coffee store , however . 
i had to look for a new food for my 100 pound puppy br she has a sensitive stomach and sheds extensively when in that phase and as many of you know , it is hard to find good food br i have ordered 3 small bags of different food brands , this one was the first on the list to try br br after 2 days , the coat of my dog got better and softer too i would have not thought that it would work so fast br poop stayed solid \( i did n't have a problem with that on the previous food , but its important \) and it does n't have a nasty smell anymore , as with the previous food great again ! br she still sheds a little but the coat is getting much much nicer and i am confident that it is a matter of a few more days until it is in outstanding condition br br after 4 days , the shine of my dogs skin is definitely noticeable this food is high quality and it shows on your dog we also got rid of the nasty gas which is as well a great indicator of a good food i recommend this food over acana , orijen or other foods with high protein levels , as it is grain free ! ! ! \( very important \) br br as for the price , amazon is a fabulous website \( i do have prime \) , however i was able to get 2 bags for 39 94 bag with shipping included on another website ! and as i am typing this , i got additional on time 10 off so not even with prime i would be able to get to that price br br anyway , as far as the food goes , it is very very good just be careful with the high protein levels , not all dogs might do well with it get a small bag and see how it works and of course mix it in with current food if it does n't work \( lot of gas and loose stool after a week or more \) , try a different brand with less protein you might want to look at precise holistic , fromm gold or canidea alternatives very good foods but the protein is lower get small bags , try one , mix in little by little , if it does n't work , go back to the previous food and than start with the other bag br br in case of questions i will be happy to help br br update so after about two weeks of use , the coat is shinier as ever , its absolutely beautiful the last time i remember her coat being so shiny was when she was a puppy there is a little gas now and than , but nothing horrible \( and i do feed my dog at night , so her stomach works during the night \) , stool is solid and still no smell i also notice my dog shaking her head less because of ears , food can cause ear and eye infection , so that is satisfying too as for the shedding , it has almost stopped its 80 better ! ! ! br br this is definitely the best food we have tried in 18 months we have tried around 10 12 different brands that gives you an idea of how good it is also , it is ridiculously cheap , if you know , where to buy it this food , under 40 ! is without a doubt , the best food money can buy well , at least for us it is . 
i have two english bull terrier with bad allergies one of which is very picky and quickly stopped eating any type of dog food that i bought they have been eating newman 's advanced dog formula for active or senior dogs for 18 months now and have not tired of it their skin and mobility has improved and they love it i buy it by subscription so we never have to worry about running out and it is the cheaper way to purchase my local stores only sell small bags which is an expensive way to buy . 
this stuff is the real deal ! not too soft , not too hard , not too salty , no fat , and a great smokey flavor with just a touch of spice that makes your tongue tingle for a commercially produced product , this is really a satisfying strip of jerky i was pleasantly surprised and will definately purchase again . 
my husband recently bought me a keurig brewer i was excited for my new toy but my joy quickly turned into dismay when i saw how expensive the little cups cost i love coffee and have always bought beans to grind i was delighted when i found these wonderful little disposable filters to use with my brewer now i have the best of both worlds ! br i placed my order and to my surprise they showed up 3 days later ! . 
i have used harmony valley hamburger substitute several times now and have been very happy it is spiced and tastes pretty close to a meatball mixture when used in sauce or to stuff peppers i cannot tell that it is not hamburger meat i was thrilled with its performance and its ease of use i ca n't wait to try it in other recipes . 
i am a bit of a foodie and have become quite picky over the years i have to say , hands down , this is my favorite olive oil it 's affordable and non pretentious amazing flavor i use a lot of olive oil in cooking and this is great for that and just by itself to drag a piece of crusty bread through or to drizzle over caprese i definitely recommend this to anyone looking and unsure of what to buy because who knows \? but this one is a keeper and a must try ! . 
i found the taste and strength of this coffee just right for it to gain the honor of one of my go to coffees for my keurig not too strong or bitter , i rather enjoy the flavor sadly with the recent k cup coup staged by green mountain coffees , it looks like amazon is n't carrying the wolfgang puck coffees any longer and my subscribe and save \( and my business \) will need to go elsewhere definitely give this coffee a shot if you can . 
these are excellent snack crackers , but you need a really good set of teeth to bite into them ! we have eaten them plain but they are probably excellent with cheese also the interesting thing is that once you manage to bite a piece off they are not hard to chew ! br br chock full of healthy seeds , these are great for either a snack or to accompany a bowl of soup or a salad . 
found this product discounted at a good price at slickdeals net for about 10 br br first time drinking this stuff since i bought it i was blown away at how awesome it taste this was my first time trying something other than the nestle brand cocoa \( other than the few times i ordered cocoa at a cafe \) br br has a nice blend of mocoa cocoa and does n't taste too sweet like what i'm used to with nestle br br definitely giving this a thumbs up . 
we purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born they make a very nice announcement of the new arrival they are however very hard if you actually want to chew the bubble gum . 
this is exactly what i wanted it is much cheaper to buy it this way and not through a store thank you so much ! ! i'm new to the gluten free diet and this is perfect ! ! . 
i 've ordered most of the cheaper tea 's etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor and value i cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in a href http www amazon com gp product b004tj3zua takeya airtight drink maker pitcher jug , set of two a and it works wonderfully \( those jugs are great , even better if you can still find them half price at costco \) br br i'm glad i ordered this when i did , the price has more than doubled ! i 'd still say it 's a great value this is my go to tea when i want something with a little more flavor than regular black tea i do n't sweeten my tea , but i think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day the orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others it 's noticeable without being pungent or artificial it also is n't spiced like many other orange teas . 
soft and slightly chewy candy is optimal \( not gummy \) to me and these are that the flavors are good but not great they are heavily coated with sugar to sweeten them up as they are not sweet without the sugar coating i will purchase them again . 
we love this product we 've also got our little grandbaby hooked on it , when she comes to visit she 's now 2 we feel more comfortable with her drinking goat milk than cow 's milk much easier to digest love that meyenberg sometimes , though , we find better prices elsewhere on the internet . 
i hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent i decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers it is flavorful without being overpowering it is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced after the first try i have continued to drink it just as it comes you can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea . 
my mom was born in manchester , england , and i have been drinking tea since i was very young a few years ago i was forced to switch to decaf tea most of the blends available are terrible i used to drink regular yorkshire tea , and was thrilled to discover they had a decaf blend and it is a strong , full bodied tea , and i love it ! i decided to purchase from amazon because i knew i could count on them , as well as their outside vendors i was very pleased with the transaction and would purchase from them again . 
i put 1 2 teabags of easy now in an entire teapot let it steep for 20 30 min and have some before bed no matter when i got to sleep , i always wake up 7 8 hours later , feeling good , and without having woken up in the middle of the night \( except maybe to use the restroom , but i always fall back asleep instantly \) its also great anytime during the day to just calm your nerves , it wo n't make you sleepy this is easily my favorite calming tea . 
these are the best beer sausages i , ve come across in decades ! they taste just like the old time sausages i used to get in bars when i was younger if you wont take my word for it just ask 3 of my friends ! ! . 
this is one of the best decaf coffee 's i have ever had i was ordering this product from another website but found that amazon 's subscribe and safe plan is the most economical great product . 
this is the best i 've ever eaten if you like mustard and you like br horseradish this is the product to try br my first experience with thomy was several years ago when my son lived br in germany he used to send it home , but after he moved back to the br states the supply was cut off but when you notified me that it was br available , i was ecstatic br the blend is delicious , and goes well with your favorite crackers and br cheese appetizers or with anything you enjoy with mustard it adds br that little zing br give it a try , you wo n't be sorry . 
i'm always on the lookout for soda 's that are made using real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice instead of chemicals switch 's ingredients are filtered water , apple , grape , tangerine , orange and acerola juice concentrates , gum acacia , natural flavors and colors and ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) it also says it contains soy so avoid it if you are allergic to soy one can contains 100 vitamin c and 20 vitamin a it also contains 34 grams of sugar and it tastes like it br br the taste of switch is very similar to regular orange soda which includes the syrupy taste that orange soda has i personally do n't like the syrupy taste and think this is way too sweet i can see kid 's liking the taste however and it is a much better alternative to regular orange soda 34 grams of sugar is a lot for 8 3 ounces of a drink i would avoid it for myself but may use it as an occasional substitute for my kids . 
we bought this after reading about it on dr sear 's website our son has had no problems at all with the formula , we add brown rice syrup per our pediatricians recommendation \( to add calories \) our son was a preemie , and was ebf for the first 7 months until stress from work affected milk production our son took to the goats milk right away , we mixed the first couple bottles with breastmilk until we knew he had no digestive issues with it , then were able to give him goats milk by itself the goats milk smells and tastes better when warm than cold i grew up on goats milk myself , so the taste does n't bother me , but my husband is n't crazy about good thing our son loves it , because that 's what really counts ! it 's 1 3 the cost of convential \( cow 's milk based \) formula and is easier for tiny tummies to digest it 's a win win all around ! . 
my daughter loved the little tin that came with her adagio tea set so much that i got her a cannister of this for christmas i think it will end up being a regular gift as we all love it so much it really is delicious , and with green tea being so good for you , we drink it all the time all the products i 've tried from adagio have been wonderful . 
i must admit when i first ordered this bread for my new panasonic bread maker , i was not expecting anything other than potato bread such as i buy at a nearby store however , was i ever surprised ! it was absolutely the best stuff and with some organic butter piled high and properly melted it was on a par with ambrosia i just could not believe how good it was and is since the first loaf , i have made other breads which have been generally excellent but none are quite at the level of this potato bread it is really good ! perhaps the credit goes to my new bread machine ! highly recommended ! ! ! general info the package makes a 1 5 pound loaf on my machine the recommended setting is basic and the loaf bakes in 4 hours also , the flour is non gmo verified as labelled . 
it 's that good ! heaven if you like cinnamon tastes sweet with no sugar . 
bought 1 2 lb each of five different mo 's fudge recently from a school fundraiser i'm not much of a chocolate fudge eater , prefer peanut butter , but the dark chocolate fudge is incredible so rich and creamy ! almost too creamy had to throw it into the fridge to make it easier to cut but if any fudge can turn me into a chocolate fudge lover , this can ! . 
this is my new favorite tea it is absolutely delicious and even after it 's sat and gotten cold , it 's good i'm not a fan of milk in my tea but i 'll drink this without sugar , no problem it has a naturally creamy flavor fantastic tea . 
zen brews up to an golden amber liquor the aroma is sweet spearmint the blending of this tea is excellent spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor , then you taste a hint of lemon the green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste br br remember that this tea does have caffeine however , it does not say how much on the box a good estimate might be 30 mg compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter four minutes is ample . 
i have been drinking royal king 100 natural organic green tea \( 100 tea bags x 2g each \) as my every day tea for several years now i buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping for many years i used to drink coffee from morning till night but finally i realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me i finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together i tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit i found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier \( coffe and other drinks do not \) the only healthier drink is quality cold water in my opinion , for the price , royal king 100 natural organic green tea is one of the best tasting teas this green tea has a beautiful golden color , the taste is bright and fresh i recommend adding a tiny amount of y s organic bee farms raw honey to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too i also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea \( tribute xi hu long jing \) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea \( although i would if i could afford it \) br br cons on my latest shipment the package shown on the amazon page is different than the one shipped the one shipped displays naturally high in polyphenol catechins \( a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea \) , whereas the amazon package displays caffene free so i am not sure if this green tea is caffene free or not the other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when i unwrap the string from around the tea bag so if the string seems stuck to the tea bag i put the bag in the hot water to unstick it . 
the grass sprouted quickly , with a great germination rate the cats love it , so much that they tried to get to it by knocking it off the mantle while i was out of town the pot was upside down for at least a day , and it looked like the grass was all going to die however , a week later it has almost fully recovered , so it 's pretty hearty . 
wolfgang puck coffees are great and the creme caramel is one of my favorites i would recommend this coffee for people who like a mild flavor . 
we first tried this because our toddler went through a picky eater phase she loved these ! they are crunchy and small enough for her to pick up i love them because they are organic and a veggie that she actually asks for i mainly give them to her right out the package but i 've also mixed them into scrambled eggs , which she really likes too . 
these are some pretty darn good nuts with some spicy bite they wont change your life , but they are good the double entendre in the name is a serious bonus . 
i love this licorice and as someone with a lot of food allergies , i appreciate that it only has four ingredients . 
while i love flavored coffees , i had never tried any of the wolfgang puck line this moved to the top of my favorites list with the first cup ! not only is the aroma delightful , the flavor is excellent as well i drink my coffee black and this one has no bitter after taste and the flavor is n't overpowering the flavor is a very light coconut and the coffee is a medium body i must admit that i was a little hesitant about a coconut flavor don't be ! everyone around me wants a cup i refuse to share ! . 
have drunk this as my standard brew for years however , tastes change , and i'm beginning to sense that it 's a little on the light side for my maturing tastes nothing wrong with it it 's better than most restaurant coffees by a wide margin . 
i have been using this curry paste for several years now , and it makes a great dish although it does n't beat eating indian out , its the best paste i have used for at home dishes even though this is a hot paste , i would consider it mild . 
when my daughter was an infant , she was allergic to something in my breastmilk and was put on neocate which worked wonders for her allergic colitis for my son , we were therefore very careful when it came time to picking out a formula to supplement breastmilk his stomach does react when i have accidentally had more dairy than i can tolerate so my pediatrician recommended a lactose free formula , especially given our asian background i wanted something organic , not soy , lactose free , and with as clean of a label as possible and this formula fulfills all of those criteria my son did n't like it at first , but now he switches easily between breastmillk and formula he has not been gassy nor spit up on it i really wish amazon stocked it . 
i bought 4 packets and planted one of them it only took a couple of days for the sprouts my cats love it ! . 
put simply this is a brilliant piece of kit does exactly what it says on the tin converts any xlr mic to usb including phantom power supply br br we have an neuman professional condenser mic here at blockhouse tv and i kid you not it sounds amazing with this piece of kit have plugged into our mac and thrown the signal into audacity and or final cut pro and it sounds the business no hum , noise , clicks or pop we use it to voice the children 's animation dvd series jack and holly both the actors and the tech staff find it a really easy and portable set up to use ok looks are n't great and it 's plastic but i do n't really give a monkey 's about that all i care about is the signal to noise ratio , the sound quality and can it power our very expensive mics \? the answer is yes it can we say buy ! br br a href http www amazon com gp product b004am5pz4 jack and holly 's christmas countdown \( us format \) a a href http www amazon com gp product b00439gwtm jack and holly 's christmas countdown \( european format \) dvd a . 
these are the best canned tomatoes i have tasted they have a fresh flavor , similar to home canned this is my second time buying a set they are a little more acidic bright , and have a rounder flavor than other tomatoes comes with a basil leaf in each can note , the 28 oz tins are a better value than the 14 oz ones . 
bought four , 2 lb bags and use them to make bread and pizza dough if you have fantacies of that perfect italian pizza you had while touring through italia , this flour is just the thing the dough even smells slightly better , the final product produces the closest thing to that wonderful crust you ca n't find in the usa it 's worth the dough , for the dough . 
this is the best tasting coffee available on k cups ! ! ! ! the flavor is amazing , it is more expensive than other brands , but for a reason definitely worth trying . 
i really enjoy these low calorie chips they have a good flavor with a good crunch and are crisp br br i was wondering if when ordering a case of these chips one could order their favorites and not the whole 6 flavors \? say just 2 flavors if desired \? \? br br its a great product do n't stop manufacturing them . 
neither myself nor my husband can have any type of corn products , but we love cornbread this mix makes biscuits that taste just like corn bread to us nice to find an alternative that tastes so great ! appreciate having this order size option as well since it 's often missing from grocery store shelves . 
my son loves the best earth 's baby food and his favorite seems to be the vegetable and turkey he smiles at every mouthful br br i would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way all the food i feed my son is through earth 's best . 
this is a very tasty product this is my first time trying this , and i am glad i ordered it to see how it tastes as a product i 'd order it again br br one odd thing though that will cause me to lower this rating from 5 stars to 4 is that the listing here says a pound , but on the label 16 ounces is crossed out and 14 ounces is written next to it i did n't weigh the container to confirm this , but if it is 14 ounces , then then they need to update their listing to show such br br since i consider shipping to not be part of a product review i wo n't lower my star rating for this , and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was slow i ordered it on june 20th a usps tracking delivery confirmation number was generated on the 21st to be fair , but it took until july 5th for me to get this even taking into account that there was a major holiday july 4th , that just seems too slow everything was packaged well enough \( although without anything like a blue ice pack to keep it cold for summer shipping \) but just took a long time to get here i do suspect the order was n't truly shipped until the week before the july 4th weekend , despite a tracking number being generated on june 21st . 
grove square hot cocoa is just the right amout of milk chocolate , not to much chocolate , just the right mixture delicious ! i say a good cup of hot chocolate try grove square hot cocoa , milk chocolate k cups for keurig coffee makers enjoy ! i did . 
the chips are good with fast service but i ordered a case \( 24 \) of popchips 6 flavor variety pack and received 24 bags all barbecue flavored . 
i love , love this green tea it is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and i usually do n't get as many boxes as i did with this merchant i will definitely order from this seller again ! ! thanks ! ! i depend on my green tea fix everyday ! . 
this sauce is something of a permanent staple on our table ! ! just about everything gets a dash or two , or three ! . 
i got one k cup of wolfgang puck 's colombian reserve dark roast as part of a variety 35 pack that i bought here on amazon since i 'd always assumed that i preferred the less burnt flavor of a light or medium roast , i was pleasantly surprised that i enjoyed the way this coffee sat on my tongue it is sweet , full , and gently bitter i brewed it in a 9 25 oz cup in an effort to dilute it a little , but i may be gutsy enough to try a 7 25 oz cup the next time around . 
i was absolutely amazed at how good this is in my opinion , it is as good as fresh ground coffee beans brewed up while i only use when i'm in a hurry , or want one cup , i would not be without it \( and i have never used instant before now . 
i happen to like foods that arent as sweet as kool aid or other sugary drinks very refreshing after mowing the lawn and helped keep those afternoon headaches away . 
i love the walnut oil it came in cans which i like a lot because you hardly see them any more the walnut oil was better quality than any of the walnut oil i bought in my neighbourhood and cheaper even with the shipping charge i recommend it to anyone . 
i purchased the cups , lids and filters they work exactly how i expected them to work perfectly ! the lids and cups can be used more than once the filters unfortunately cannot i am going to be looking in the future for cups that have the filters attached like in the regular prefilled k kups very good product though ! . 
product was great , but i ordered paid for 2 lbs received only 2 oz i have been unable to get any response from custom service there is no way to reach the company by phone i just put this credit card transaction into disputed ! \( \( \( i still want my 2 lbs ! . 
as an avid rice cracker fan , i 've tried a lot of different varieties , and this is the best as far as taste and availability goes obviously some of the best are in the japanese grocery stores , but at least in my case , they 're out of the way most of the time br br the crackers themselves are savory and crunchy exactly what i look for in this snack \( and this particular mix is nothing but crackers ! \) br thanks to these , i 've stopped trying out the regular grocery store imitations . 
when i used the k cup filter that came w keurig , i did n't like the taste of any coffee i used so i stopped using it altogether however , when i saw disposakups on amazon , i had my doubts but took a chance they worked great plan to keep them in stock . 
raw cacao powder differs greatly in taste than processed cacao powder commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor commercial cacao powder is mono tonal in flavor raw cacao is everything that commercial cacao is n't it is a antioxidant super food which has no equal the taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next as to taste , it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of mahogany in foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao in baking , i believe it goes well with other flavors such as almond extract if you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of almond extract , your icing will have no equal in chocolate cake i personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake the acid helps to unify and amplify flavors i like making cake with 60 cake flour which is about has about 5 wheat gluten and 40 rice flour the reason for this should be obvious the heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough br br raw cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols , such as catechins and procyanidins , and has been shown to inhibit low density lipoprotein \( ldl \) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high density lipoprotein \( hdl \) and decreases ldl levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens . 
i am very fond of citrus drinks to begin with , so maybe i am biased br br but what i liked most about this was it was n't too sweet and it is all natural and it has a real citrus taste not a fabricated one br br love it . 
i saw this item in my local grocery store , and i thought i would give it a try br br i have to admit , i was very surprised about how much i enjoyed this item i found it refreshing , and i felt that i had a bit more energy i would happily purchase this product again and again br br a word of advice to people complaining that it does n't taste coconutty enough coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things coconut water comes from a green , immature coconut , while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut a hard , brown , fiber covered shell just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different , the same can be said of coconut if you do n't think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada , you will probably enjoy it even more . 
our 3 year old son was diagnosed with being allergic to soy and peanuts this is the only sunflower butter that we have found that is free of both allergens and not processed on shared equipment this is the only product we buy now our son likes it on pb j , crackers , on celery and by the spoonful and with no sugars added much more healthy for him . 
earth 's best baby food br my favorite brand of baby food by far both my son \( who is now over 2 years old \) and my daughter \( now almost one \) have used a wide variety of foods from earth 's best i am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth but i do not feel that all organic brands are equal i 've tried many varieties \( including store brands and others only available through internet purchase \) and found that earth 's best is by far the best for your money br br fruit variety pack br normally i would say this is a great idea , but i was n't a fan of this particular variety my son would have been just fine with it , but unfortunately for us at this point my daughter is allergic to raspberries and mangos these are both things i think she 'll grown out of , but something you may want to consider when purchasing this item i would suggest trying an individual serving of one from your local store to see if your child has an allergy , but if they do n't i would say buy it ! other than that i do think it 's a great variety for kids who need some changing up occasionally also , the subscription price on this variety is great and can be altered depending on how soon you need it we ended up running through another subscription we had and were able to have another shipped as soon as we needed it . 
tastes like drinking a cherry pie i purchased this for my mother 's gout and she told me it works quickly it 's also supposed to help lower blood pressure speedy delivery it 's not 5 stars because of the high price . 
for any tea lover , \( we became fans in england \) ahmad tea pleases immensely i we have sampled tea from quite a few vendors but after our son brought a pack of ahmad tea back with him \( from jolly old \) as a gift , we were sold we found the flavor splendid we loved it it is fully flavored and needs no sugar milk sweetener at all \( and i usually needed sweeteners with the other brands of earl grey , so \) br buying it from amazon is a very economical solution and delivery was expediant i highly recommend , if you enjoy hot tea , try this brand ! br mac , br please excuse any spelling errors , that may have occurred in my haste , and no spell check help heheheh ta ta earl grey hot jlp . 
old mother hubbard biscuits \( we 've tried these as well as the puppy variety \) are the only true biscuits my dogs like ! they would eat the whole bag if i let them the only thing i do n't like is they contain wheat , but as long as your dog does n't have a wheat allergy , it 's no big deal i would definitely recommend them . 
i hate to admit i miss the lard i was the one in your 4th grade class who unscrewed the oreo , ate all the white middle , licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers that 's the image i have of this cookie even barbra streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of a href http www amazon com gp product b000ayel1a a star is born a the oreos because she had two back up singers who were black that 's why the idea of an oreo thin crisp is rather lost on me br br it is a single , nickel sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached wheat thin than the original oreo it does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute do n't get me wrong , as the oreo thin crisps are perfectly fine as low calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go they simply lack the lip smacking satisfaction of a disassembled oreo digested in pieces the whole point of the 0 81 ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are 100 calorie packs , a fine idea for weight watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight it 's just that i do n't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack . 
you will love this jerky if you are a beer drinker recommend this product for sure for them nights around the campfires ! . 
for the guy who love to saucethings up , here 's the perfect gift and he will love the wooden crate packaging ! great idea and perfect gift \) . 
thanks to the wonderful reviews i read about this crispbread , i decided to purchase there are many other crispbreads crackers that i 've purchased that taste like cardboard and have little flavor i think this crispbread is really delicious a little sweet with lots of crunch and a variety of seeds great flavor i like that it 's organic , whole grain , and relatively high in protein it 's a little different from other crackers and it is great topped with egg or tuna salad or all by itself delicious ! i will have to try some of the other doctor kracker crispbreads i will certainly be ordering more of these . 
great product ! br br i purchased this product from our local fresh market i am a vegan and am always looking for different meat substitutes to try i used this mix to make some taco mince this stuff was perfect ! i even got my non veg father to try a bite of the tacos and he thought they were good as well that right there is saying something , because my father is really iffy about mock meats br br i have another packet in which i am going to cook up today ! . 
my daughter says this is the very best hot chocolate she has ever had ! and i love it because no more spilled envelope messes ! . 
my dog is a service dog and she is kind of out in the woods lots so this is a very good training tool and treat plus i can share them with other dog 's if i see fit . 
i love tea , hot or cold , and am always looking to try new ones this tea brews up a wonderful cup just opening the bag to scoop some out is a joy the smell alone is captivating i tried a cup to relieve a stomach ache and it relieved my discomfort immediately it really does taste just like good quality licorice and it 's naturally sweet when my urge for sweets hits , i can now reach for this tea instead and it really does satisfy my cravings this tea will be a staple in my pantry . 
this hot sauce is one of my favorites its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy you can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle a mix of garlic , habanero , and other spices i put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week i highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce . 
i used to work in a specialty pet store , and cats were my specialty i was the expert on diet after spending much time researching various foods , reading labels , and talking to customers i 'll share what i learned , and explain why i recommend this food science diet is one of the worst foods for cats , and right down at the bottom you 'll also find purina , meow mix , eukanuba , and iams these have by products , fillers \( corn , soybean mill run , corn gluten , grits , or white rice \) br br many of the better foods like blue buffalo , artemis , wellness , instinct , orijen , california naturals , innova evo , merrick , and my personal favorite vet 's choice health extension are world 's apart in quality and most are cheaper than science diet pound for pound in many stores br br these are the ingredients for a typical science diet bag minus the vitamins minerals , just to give you an example br br ground whole grain corn , chicken by product meal , animal fat , dried beet pulp , soybean oil , dried egg product , flaxseed br br corn is a filler , and it 's the number one ingredient by products are things like beaks , feathers , etc they 're waste products the only decent ingredients are down the ingredient list , meaning that they exist in a smaller amount then the first ingredients now , let 's look at a bag of health extension that 's both cheaper and of higher quality br br chicken , chicken meal , brown rice , oats , dried egg product , chicken fat , flaxseed , menhaden fish meal , herring oil , sweet potato , cranberries , blueberries , tomato pomace , natural barley malt , apple cider vinegar , goji berry , garlic , astragalus , ginger , blue green algae 6 kinds of probiotics br br the potato is a nice binder and good for digestion the oils and flaxseed are good for the coat being rich in omegs 3 's the probiotics regulate digestion the eggs and chicken are good sources of protein you might not need some of the extra ingredients like goji berry for example , but they 're better than fillers and at the very least harmless to cats br br i recommend this food because my cats love it , it 's relatively cheap for a quality food , and the ingredients are top notch if you want better food , go with instinct \( which my cats love even better , especially the rabbit \) but be prepared to pay much more the absolute best would be to put your cats on a raw diet using pucks of meat prepared by various companies , or simply do it yourself if you 've researched how to prepare it , but this is an even more expensive route . 
great coffee we mix it with godiva chocolate coffee or regular medium roast what a treat . 
i was looking for a replacement for timothy 's kona blend which is no longer carried on amazon this coffee from green mountain is very nice , but not strong enough for me if you like milder coffees , then this one is for you . 
i enjoy my kavli crispy thins so much and so often that i now order by the case besides being naturally low fat and naturally nutritious , kavli crisp thins are a great replacement for salty , fattening nachoes , and or pizza with crispy thins , you can make your own nachos by layering the crisps w chopped tomatoes , cheese , even ground meat pop 2 crisp thins w toppings in microwave , and you 've got your delicious nachos , \( or pizza \) i have crispy thins w melted cheese every morning great way to start the day no , i do n't work for kavli ! this is not an ad , but a truthful review also so nice and easy to be able to order kavli \( and just about everything \) via amazon . 
after trying several brands of hot cocoa my kids have decided that this is the one for them i'm certainly happy about it because not only is it delicious , but it 's also more affordable 3 boys can consume a box of hot cocoa very quickly , even with limits set it 's also very convenient to have it shipped automatically if we do n't drink that much i simply skip a month if friends come over and we drink a lot , i just order an extra box it 's quick , simple and delicious . 
i was n't expecting this one to be so rich or full ! yet it has a smoky finish that is typical of a french roast but does n't taste burnt i think alot of times a french roast tastes thin and yet bitter instead of full and smoky , but not this one ! very pleased with it and will definitely order again if you like a stronger cup in the morning , without being bitter , give this one a try . 
this is such a great product from subtle flavors and aromas for delicate dishes to smokey salts for hearty cooking , this is a great product for the chef who loves flavor and experimenting in the kitchen this is such a cool product ! ! . 
this instant coffee is a versatile ingredient you can add it to ice cream you are freezing \( or gelato or sorbet \) or you can add it to chocolate icing to make mocha flavor it is the ingredient to have when the recipe calls for one cup of strong , cold coffee br br as a beverage on its own , it is a bit more acid than fresh espresso but as a mix with milk , it works wonderfully well you wo n't make a barrista cup of espresso with instant , but you will have a great way to make a latte in a pinch and for regular cooking , i personally am never without this jar on my shelf . 
i 've used natures logic dog food for about a year the difference in my dogs is impressive their coats are like silk what a wonderful product ! . 
i bought the whirley pop stovetop popcorn popper several months ago , which \( of course \) the wabash valley popcorn came recommended \( same company \) i thought what the heck i 've always wondered how gourmet popcorn differed from orville or other everyday popcorn brands br br let me tell you it is worth the extra money ! i can really taste the difference in quality and , normal popcorn just does n't taste right when you make it in the whirley pop br br this popcorn is so tender and tasty it was a little weird to see and eat at first because it 's about half the size of regular popcorn but , i believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn br br my favorite prep methods include using the whirley pop and nutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil \( see my review for that for more details ! \) i add a little peanut oil , sea salt , black pepper , and a good amount of vegaline garlic mist cooking seasoning spray yummy ! ! ! ! br br i 've tried the other amish country popcorn , and they 're all good this is my favorite , though ! . 
i have given this product five stars because it works very well for coffee with the filters that come with it br br but my five stars come with a warning do n't use these little cups without using the little filters , especially with teas or tea based coffee substitutes \( like loose teeccino \) the tea leaves swell to a far greater extent than water logged , ground coffee beans they also swell much faster , which tends to clog the small , unprotected puncture at the bottom of the little cups so , not using the filter is a very , very dumb idea if you put less tea in the little cups , the tea still clogs the system without the filters ! br br so be wise , and use the cups with the filters br br for what it 's worth , though , the solo my k cup works perfectly with all types of contents , with or without the little filters it 's ridiculously expensive , however happily , for me , who am not flowing with dough , the plastic cups \( with the little filters \) are an answer . 
the quality of tofu is very good but it is a little bit more soft than what i expected i will try the firm version . 
i'm actually suprised from reading some of the rants about this coffee i have tried 20 k cup varieties and this is by far my favorite contrary to some reviews , i do n't find it to be weak at all and in fact , is quite bold but with absolutely not hints of being bitter very smooth and leaves a great aftertaste i prefer really strong coffee and this is a good compromise for a medium roast as it 's not as bold as i would normally prefer but certainly strong enough to satisfy my preferences br br i typically drink wolfgang 's jamaica me crazy but ever since trying rodeo drive , i have n't gone back . 
our daughter has several food allergies , so nana 's chocolate munch cookie bars are perfect ! out of all the gluten free cookies out there , my daughter just loves nana 's no eggs , no dairy , no refined sugar , no hydrogenated oils , no cholesterol , no casein , no soy , no corn they are made from natural ingredients and sweetened with fruit juice br br now , do n't get me wrong , for the average person these do not taste like a regular cookie i do not personally like the texture , but the chocolate flavor is good i will say that this is a wonderful product for people with food allergies , but not someone who can have regular cookies . 
for years , i 've been completely devoted to dunkin donuts brewed at the store and at home i tried brewing dd in my k cup and i also bought the eco brew and the actual dd k cups awful ! so i was searching high and low for a new coffee after trying all the decaf k cups on the market , i finally found and loved wolfgang puck decaf coffee k cups this is the only place i can find them so i hope amazon never stops selling them here they are mellow , medium roast and i enjoy them every day any other brand is just a back up try them i have never had any trouble with any of the cups and i'm on my third order now of 48 cups if they had a problem , they 've fixed it br br this is an update being done on july 7 , 2012 i continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee every day it has ruined me for other coffees as i measure every other cup against this incredible wolfgang puck decaf k cup please , please , please amazon , make this part of your subscription service my head hurts trying to make sure that i always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee . 
just received these boxes rather than buying the bar type that i did before excellent ! they are small bite size pieces that are soft and flavorful really fresh i did the subscribe and save and am happy that i did my husband and i really enjoy this brand the boxes are larger than i realized , but i still will carry this item in my purse for a pick me up and to have a handy snack available with me the boxes have a open and close tab with a plastic seal over the product once you open the box i ca n't find one bad thing to say no dissapointments at all . 
this seller was great ! ! ! recieved my order in about 4 days ! ! ! the cayenne is great ! ! ! nice flavor and hot just the way i like it ! ! ! will be back for more after the 2lbs are gone ! ! ! thanks for a great product at a good price ! ! ! . 
it is not the best , but for the money and that extra 30 off , its the best value you can get i am very happy with my purchase and now i can drink good coffee everyday as opposed to the crap office coffee or that once a month expensive coffee after buying this , i was satisfied enough to buy another 2 pack of cafe special note the expiration dates on my hazelnut bags are 12 2011 . 
i have a dog with severe allergies we have been fighting for years the vets always recommend mass produced allergy formulas like science diet i ca n't stomach feeding my dog that type of garbage but simple is a good alternative , made with quality ingredients and the dogs love it too great product ! ! . 
i ordered the white christmas , christmas eve , and christmas morning blends last year for the holidays and fell in love with the christmas eve it 's the smoothest of the bunch and has such a wonderful flavor , i use it for iced teas all year round i can honestly say that i never got into tea that much until i tried stash teas i sent the licorice and lemon flavors to my father , and he called me to ask where i 'd gotten it , because his neighbor wanted to get some for his wife , too once tried , you will be addicted visit the stashtea website for lots of tea related bits and baubles these make perfect hostess gifts over the holidays along with a plate of cookies . 
kids love the sauce on many things great on rice , chicken , spicy sweet br br highly recommend . 
these biscuits are delicious , not too sweet , with just enough crunch we love them quick delivery we would order them again very satisfied . 
my children will only eat healthy products , and they love these graham crackers i am so glad that they are available through amazon ! . 
i found this brand and the fact that it was dark chocolate made it by far the best i 've had for my keurig i will continue to order this particular brand . 
good description of this product has the over roasted popular coffee flavor , but , not overpowering one of my favorites so far . 
tasty , convenient bars for people with celiac disease they seem to have gotten smaller over time , but the taste and convenience outweigh the reduction in size \( and the price \) . 
these muffins will not win any prizes for flavor i agree with other reviewers that the aftertaste is somewhat bitter and compared to \( at least what i remember of \) real muffins with sugar , gluten , eggs , butter , and that other good stuff they are quite fine br br i do not eat gluten , derivatives of sugar cane , eggs , soy , dairy , corn i could go on but you get the idea in order to use this mix i had to make substitutions and was delighted with what tastes like a treat to me aside from the fact that i do n't have to measure out three kinds of flour to make something from scratch , the best thing about these muffins is the texture texture is a challenge absent gluten , sugar , and eggs , and i found this to be very much like how i remember muffins the bits of dried apple make these chewy and kind of weirdly so br br overall , i am pleased with my purchase . 
we 've long enjoyed this brand of chip , so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these br br granted i bought them somewhat reluctantly because i'm a confirmed salt aholic , generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans i was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot br br how nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt . 
i take it every day i used to take fish oil but when i made the change to plant based oil for my body , it was like night and day i felt the change , and loved it . 
i am on a low glycemic index diet to help control my blood sugar and hormone levels my nutritionist recommended agave nectar as a sweetener since it 's gi index is in the low 30 's as opposed to honey in the low 50 's and sugar in the mid 50 's i 've tried supermarkets , health food stores and wholesale clubs the prices are usually around 13 for a 32oz bottle and this is 19ish for 2x46oz it 's used like honey substitute 2 3c for every 1c sugar and reduce liquids by 1 4th br br i also use it in a carrot cake recipe \( equal substitution \) instead of sugar where i substitute whole wheat flour instead of white flour and i do n't decrease the other liquids it 's delicious and you 'd never know that 's it 's actually good for you . 
i like the dessert delights line , and this is one of their better flavors but the carton i received contains only packs that are stale the sticks are stiff and difficult to chew , and the flavor disappears within 10 minutes i'm quite disappointed that they would dump old products on their customers . 
this coffee is awesome kinda bold , with a sweetness excellent my son says with international 's carmel macchiado creamer you can find in the dairy section . 
i started buying this after i noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his spunk so i decided it was time to start buying him real cat food not the garbage in the super markets i found this at the pet store out of the other million choices , and i'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one i went with to try first and it was a great purchase my cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he 's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft mainly , he loved the taste even more ! i highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals ! . 
this is my favorite hot sauce i buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy ! my favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce ! . 
the mixture of juices they use to sweeten this give it a little bit of an odd taste and makes it too sweet it 's not a straight orange citrus flavor not being an apple juice fan i was n't fond of it br br i gave it four stars b c it is what it advertises it 's juice with sparkling water , unlike some other healthy sparkling beverages that are basically soda br br for sparkling juice i prefer izze it 's a little less sweet . 
this is my favorite late evening cup of coffee nice flavor , just right before retiring for the night keep stocking this brand and i will keep coming back for it ! ! . 
we are big izzie fans , but we were excited to try this sode we were very pleasantly pleased it is a very orange taste , delicious and it feels good to know there is absolutely no sugar so , when our children want a soda we serve this and they are delighted it 's a win win ! . 
having tried all the varieties of hot chocolate k cups , grove square 's are by far the best they are very chocolaty , rich , creamy , and leave very little sludge in the bottom of your cup yum . 
for coffee drinkers who buy maxwell house coffee , this is a deal ! buy two cases for just over 50 ! free shipping , too ! seriously , you know i stocked up ! . 
i switched my mini schauzers over to newman 's own organics a month ago when they came off of their puppy chow i 've been looking for a good quality dog food \( rated 4 stars by dogfoodadvisor com \) without going into debt purchasing it ! i was feeding them a different brand that was breed specific food , but was having trouble trying to find it in stock anywhere a few places , if they carried it at all , only carried the very small bags \( 2 5 lbs \) and with two dogs , one bag would last about 3 5 days plus these little 2 5 lb bags cost more than half what the larger 10 lb bag cost ! i tried to make an arrangement to have one of the places order the larger bag for me , but they conveniently forgot to place the order , so i was stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags then i heard about newman 's own organics , which is rated a better dog food than the breed specific food i was using and cost less ! and then i discovered that i could buy this food at amazon com , have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for signing up for the subscription plan delivery no brainer ! ! no more running out of food , no more driving 50 miles or more to find it , no more hassels ! br br and best and most importantly of all , my little guys love it ! ! their stools firmed up almost immediately after starting the switchover , they seem more active , more alert , more regular and they actually chew this food \( they inhaled their puppy chow without chewing ! \) i ca n't say enough good things about both newman 's own and amazon 's subscription delivery service ! . 
my wife is very fond of chocolate covered cherries and has tried just about every brand she assures me that these are the very best she 's ever eaten . 
looks fresh and clean i have roasted it in the toaster oven and i also use it in food whole or ground up in the coffee grinder . 
i was happy to get the disposacups and look forward to using them i really like the paper filters i am wondering if the cups can be used again i know the lid ca n't i will see what happens with this for future uses . 
i have lots of ground coffee and since having my keurig have not been able to use it but , with the disposable cups , i can use up all my ground coffee and get the tastes i want i would buy again convenient \( be sure you snap the lid on securely because it is a tight fit \) . 
i thought this coffee was really good , but i think the next time i order , i will order something a bit stronger . 
when i first found out that my 4 year old i had to go gluten free i was a little worried about how she would handle it gf bisquick has made it a lot easier i have been able to make her favorite foods such as chicken fingers , corn dogs , pizza and chinese \( sweet and sour chicken \) with this mix pancakes are also a big hit in our house they have quick and easy recipes on the box for the chinese i take their chicken finger recipe and cute the pieces of chicken into bite size pieces , and bake according to the recipe cook up some rice and just use a gf sweet and sour sauce a quick simple easy meal that tastes wonderful ! . 
i got this with the purchase of 24 different bold coffee k cups to find the ones i like best , and so far this is my favorite it may not be bold enough for some , but it is not supposed to compete with the 'extra bold' varieties this was smooth and not nearly as bitter as many bold coffees so many bold blends have a 'burned' flavor , leaving a bad taste in your mouth , this one was strong without the bad aftertaste , perfect for me ! . 
this is by far my favorite black licorice and the list of ingred could not possibly be shorter or better ! now if i could learn how to not eat the whole box in one sitting . 
great for sushi , or for use with korean kim bob , or maybe just as a snack lightly salted , great crunch , and will support , rice , beef , pork , even fish br or a vegetable or two . 
from taste to texture , bionaturae makes the best pasta i have ever eaten i will never buy cheap grocery store brand pasta again . 
so far , of all the decaf kcups we have tried , this is our favorite wish it were on the automatic ordering system coffee is such an individual like or dislike but when we use it with an 8oz cup of water it is great . 
this is a wonderful product , i was happy to see i could buy it on amazon because our local stores quit carrying it ! we use it mostly to sprinkle over chicken wings to make a cajun wing yummy ! it can be used on almost everything love it ! . 
i got disgusted with the garlic powder sold in bulk at health food stores and natural food groceries it rarely has much garlic flavor and was way too hot and the quality was very inconsistent at stores that did sometimes sell something good br br i'm now half way through my second jar of tone 's , which is consistently excellent it has a strong garlic flavor and is not hot unless you use a lot on something like broccoli it is way better than raw garlic cloves they must have an excellent source of garlic for their powder if you have doubts about your current garlic powder , smell it if it does n't have a strong garlic smell , it 's just white powder get this tone 's and you 'll get your delicious food back . 
while on a family camping trip with josh our 8yr old golden , we ran out of dog food stopped at a wegman 's market in erie pa to shop for a quality food settled on the harmony farm 's chicken josh liked it right away br we 've been mixing it with his normal food \( canidae \) br he 's very healthy and playful , his coat is shiny he 's a happy pup . 
i was very happy with the way this turned out it is very similar to traditional american beers \( bud coors \) but with an extra kick the flavor is very smooth , has a creamy head and ends with a slight bitternes this is a great beer to start with for new brewers and veterans alike if you are to anxious to wait for it to age , you can drink it after 2 weeks it will taste good , but get better with age make sure to put it in the fridge after it carbonates lager ages and taste best when in colder conditions . 
these are a great alternative to traditional greasy potato chips great for people that are dieting but still craving a salty , crunchy snack they are light and crunchy and they taste really good i was afraid they were going to be like the rice cakes and soy chips but they really taste good the original flavor reminds me a lot of the munchos chips the original flavor and salt vinegar are my favorite but they are all good my least favorite is the cheddar just because it is an overwhelming cheddar flavor \( i do n't like cheddar \) but most people really like it i have purchased these several times now and i will continue to do so i highly recommend this product for anyone ! . 
we love this variety box in our house , we subscribe to ensure we never run out i use the 'dark' to make mocha , my wife loves the 'peppermint' and i drink the 'milk' whenever i fancy a hot chocolate br br the dark makes a great mocha , just do half a cup of the dark cocoa and half a cup of your favorite coffee , add whipped cream on top , delicious also worth noting , you can try some of the flavored coffees in your mocha and rustle up some great combos i am not a fan of flavored coffee , i struggle to drink a cup but as a mocha , delightful br br drinking the peppermint or milk as a hot chocolate , we add a little milk and whipped cream on top , delicious br br i highly recommend this variety box if you are considering buying it \) . 
my package was mailed out 1st and received on the 3rd in perfect condition the tap fit the bib with no trouble or leaks and is very easy to operate i had a few questions i emailed and received answers fast by the owner the 1 gallon box of syrup is much smaller than i thought it would be , about the size of a medium cheese cake box what i do is drain syrup into a washed out sodastream container and store it in the fridge the sodastream syrup cap has 3 circles in it , bottom , second and top the top circle is 2 oz so you would fill it to that 3 times just remember after carbonating you water you remove 4 oz of water or the 1 liter bottle will over flow when adding the 6 oz of syrup 1 gallon bibs are a good way to test if this is right for you before paying high price for the 5 gallon bibs . 
the paprika is good and the container will keep it fresh for some time i use these bulk spices to make my own barbque rubs the container is also recyclable for keeping the finished rubs . 
and i do n't mean just for asian sauces this is easily the best sauce ever ! i put it on everything it 's gotten out of hand i go out of my way to see what else i can have it with my latest thing is pouring some over peanuts and coating the peanuts with the sauce then i eat the nuts with a spoon to keep my hands clean sounds gross but it 's so delicious . 
this product definitely works br i was not aware that i was supposed to break the tablet in half after eating a whole tablet , i ate a lemon it was way way too sweet ! br i waited 2 hours for the product to wear off so i could eat regular food br i tried a 1 2 tablet the next day i added some lemon to a glass of water to me , it tasted like lemonade with 5 packets of splenda it did n't taste like regular sugar which i guess is good the sweet taste was just different br i also ate cottage cheese , it tasted like cottage cheese with sweetener in it br the product works immediately by the way no waiting for this to work br br i think this product will last me a while br the day after this review i took a tiny nibble of the leftover 1 2 tablet i made another glass of lemon water and the lemonade was perfect for me not overly sweet , tasted like a lemon drop p br your mileage may vary with this product br br i 've heard that other brands taste a bit better than this one br i just ordered a pack from another company i will report back br br i have a huge sweet tooth and i'm trying to lose some weight i'm hoping these tablets will help me with that \) . 
bought these for my two dogs , one and english mastiff and the other a black mouth cur i thought it might keep them occupied for at least an hour as other reviewers had stated well , of course , my dogs had to be different 10 minutes flat , all chewed and gone i might add , both of my dogs are aggressive chewers and that 's the reason i went looking for something that would last for other dogs , who chew normally , it may well last for an hour or so br br they both love these bones and this packaging is a great buy i will continue to buy and give as a weekend treat for my boys . 
this is maybe the greatest coffee ever made i have had this many time before in regular bean that i grind myself , but never in k cups tastes the exact same and its maybe my favorite coffee ever . 
love this rodeo drive it has a very drinkable taste is also good and it is smooth ! i recomend that you try this one . 
nice small nutritious biscuit nice pocket size resealable pouch is a plus as well will order more in the future . 
what more can i ask for \? great ingredients and my dog loves these she 'll do back flips for em very good great price too . 
i moved to las vegas from san jose last year and have been missing my peet 's coffee jasmine downey pearls tea when i saw this product i bought a shipment right away i was not disappointed i love the individual silken sachets of jasmine tea pearls it is fragrant and wonderful tea i will be buying it again . 
i foolishly purchased the harmony farms healthy holistic adult dog food , since it had more for the same price \( why it had good reviews is beyond me \) my dogs will not touch the harmony farms , yet love this dog food my 10 wk old pup had slimmy poop , until the day i feed her this food both my dogs love it newman 's own organics adult dog food formula is the way to go . 
i highly recommend this product ca n't beat the calorie count my favorite use is putting natural crunchy peanut butter and blackberry jam between two pieces also great with cheese healthy product . 
the beans arrived in good time , moist and supple , no mold , very good flavor what else is there to want in regular bourbon vanilla beans \? i was very pleased with this purchase . 
we were running out of vanilla i 'd made my own before using vanilla beans and vodka , and the price of these was far cheaper than getting them locally i figured it was worth a shot br br i'm not sure what i was thinking , but half a pound of vanilla beans works out to something like 50 of them it 's hard to picture 50 vanilla beans , but this would be a good order to go in halves on with someone or quarters br br the aroma is incredible it 's been a couple of months since we originally opened them , and our pantry still smells like vanilla , even though they are wrapped in two ziploc bags br br as for the vanilla itself , it is fantastic if you 've never tried vanilla produced yourself , you are absolutely missing out there is a distinct and definite difference between homemade and what you buy at the store br br do yourself a favor , hit add to cart and check out you 'll be glad you did . 
let me start by saying my 7 month old son , who is used to my home prepared baby foods loves this , as a once in a blue moon convenience meal ! i 've tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too rare in the baby food industry br br i am following a weaning guide that i used for my daughter , and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland , watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made , healthy meals , resulting in picky toddlers and children my daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet , and i attribute that to the hard work i put in in the first year another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs are n't fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger br br i 'd love to ask , who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets , though \? my son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much fuller , so i 've had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume and it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water , so i add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little before long , i'm sure he 'll just be on 2 full 4oz jars when i give him this br br all that said , i 'll reiterate , it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food , and i have no problem giving it to my son once in a while i do recommend ! . 
purchased case of 6 cans from amazon com for bucks including shipping br good quality slow cooking oatmeal good shelf life on cans this is the slow cooking type 20 40 minutes depending on preference taste is good . 
i really like this coconut water , but i was surprised that per 17oz box it 's the same price at wegman 's probably wo n't be ordering again unless there 's some sort of discount . 
decent price arrived on time no complaints here we will continue to purchase this item br my daughter loves her goat milk \) . 
this is good vanilla coffee i got this and the green mountain and prefer this one it has a nice sweet flavor . 
perfect tool for any musicians trying to make recording much easier at an affordable price br easy to open plastic case , medium sized , durable \( people have said that the plastic body feels cheap br and feels easy to break but it 's not true the icicle 's plastic body feels durable and wo n't break if br you 're not clumsy with it or break it on purpose \) i only wished that the gain control had numbers or indications br of levels so i can turn the knob to the correct position for recording and remember it instead of guessing all the time sound quality is flawless ! no buzzing noises or anything picked up really just nice crispy sound recorded through a good quality microphone is all i hear i hear no difference in it with an icicle or a mixer . 
our ten year old doxie annie never , that 's right , never would eat any dry food until harmony farms healthy holistic chicken brown rice adult dog food that we bought from you ! every day we are in shock when she finishes each and every nugget of this dry dog food ! amazon you are truly amazing and we are so grateful that we bought this 17 5 pound bag of harmony farms dog food from you we 'll be ordering again and again from you as soon as we head towards the end of the current bag wow ! so happy about this . 
compared to other k cup products , grove square offers tasty products at a reasonable price this hot cocoa was rich and delicious ! . 
we started with fresh goats milk and after 2 weeks transitioned to this product i prepare it with warm water in the blender and add some strawberry flavoring my son \( 17 months \) loves it very easy to prepare , and compared to baby formula very reasonable in price . 
my son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement , until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and i automatically ordered it for him i was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried what a surprise ! he has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this ginger each morning he can now eat anything and actually enjoy it this product was a god send for him thank you all for it ! . 
i do not like coffee too much actually i am very particular about coffee and i can say that this is one of my favorites it is so smooth and flavorful , the smell is really good and i ca n't have enough of it i have gone as far as skipping going to starbucks or dunkin for coffee br the price is decent for this kind of product so i highly recommend it . 
i buy lavazza regular espresso in the black can pretty regularly , as i consider it the smoothest tasting of all in the supermarket br this decaf in the green can is just as good , but lacks the kick of caffeine br br one reviewer loves bustelo well it 's a matter of taste i found bustelo to be harsh and unpleasant br c'est la vie . 
3 years ago i bought a digidesign 002 protools rack and a lot of other equipment to start recording but i could never get it to work with my os on either computer i was at an impasse for a long time until i saw this product on blue 's website i already had a 400 condenser mic in the closet i had never gotten to use and did n't want to spend more money on a quality usb mic i could n't be happy that this product exists in it 's quality or price ! i noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem it does exactly what it 's suppose to do act like it does n't exist it just serves it purpose to convert the signal well , and stays out of the way on everything else it does feel light weight and the signal was a little lower than i thought \( as many reviews said \) and that is the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars but i do n't think that should keep anyone from getting this product . 
just in case you do n't know these are about 4 a box at the store , so anything more than 12 for a 3 pack is not worth it this is a great product , though \( that 's what the 4 stars are for \) the pancakes pizza dough are great , i make them all the time . 
i 've tried all three new 'dark' offerings from gevalia and i think this is the best one from the three gevalia finally came up with coffee worth serving to your guests br coffee has an earthy bold taste with little to none bitterness and no metallic after taste it actually leaves a nice smooth tasty chocolaty after taste br br the pack comes with 12 big t discs that will brew 8 ounces of coffee this coffee will delight those who love the darker roasts br br update br i am on my 5th cup of this coffee and it was really grown on me \( changing from a 4 to 5 stars \) it is quite tasty and smooth this is one coffee that will truly satisfy the void that sbux left there will be some that will say that this is not the same as sbux and it is n't ! try the coffee and give it a fair taste without trying to compare it to anything else you may find yourself quite surprised at the findings highly recommended and definitely will be buying this one again . 
we have a golden retriever and had been feeding him the wellness dog food he ate it begrudgingly so we decided to find something else i read the ingredients on the evo red meat and was really impressed i gawked at the price but decided cheaper dog food is n't really a bargain if your dog wo n't eat it or get any enjoyment out of it the first time we fed it to him he pretty much inhaled it and will literally go sit by the bag and look at it like it might just open if he stares at it hard enough ! i agree with the first reviewer that loose stools are a factor but believe with time that will clear up he is just so happy that we will keep on buying it for him , although i wish the price were a little more reasonable . 
i first discovered gluten free biscuit in the supermarket i bought it and loved it i then tried to find it again in all the local supermarkets , but could not find it i called the manufacturer and they informed me that i could purchase it at amazon i was thrilled amazon is one of my favorite web sites . 
i have been using this product to increase my ph score after a bout of ta state 1 bladder cancer there is no aftertaste and it leaves me with a clean feeling delivery from amazon 's vendor in kentucky was slow . 
these are the best potato chips i 've ever tasted it 's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping the texture crunchiness is just perfect , as is the salt and vinegar combination i do n't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips i 've ever had , but they do and , judging from the nutrition facts , they seem to be healthier , too they 're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c , which could be because they do n't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal br br and if you like these , all of the kettle chips are great . 
this is the best clam chowder ever come originally where this is produced and was so happy when i found it on line keep this in my cupboard at all time being an old maine girl this is my favorite chowder of all times . 
very good taste and a good price , no sales tax , no shipping charges and delivered to my door . 
one of the best mass produced teas i have tried light keemun flavour , delicious with or without milk and can sit in the pot without tasting stewed a great bargain in the 6 pack . 
the ingredients are simple and pure and one of the few brands that does not add unnecessary additives generally i like to make my own sauce from scratch , but this is my second choice if i am short on time its taste good and not artificially sweet i love the bionaturae products including the tomato paste . 
this is really the best decaf i have tried it is hard to find any better than the italian decafs like this one or illy unless of course you are the average local coffee drinker used to embarassments like folgers or accustomized to all the overburned and stinking like charcoal brands named for an unknown reason french roast , italian roast etc \( believe me , they have nothing to do with french or italian coffee \) not to mention the local decafs which taste more like tea made out of burned wood shavings . 
hands down , by far the absolute worst tasting tea i have ever had and i have allot ! i am an avid tea drinker and i just ca n't get it down the benefits are supposed to be amazing so i 'll keep it around to water down and sugar up but wow it 's bad so strong too , tastes like dirt \( that 's been pissed on in the woods \) . 
i love these disposakups they allow me to use some of my favorite canned or fresh bean coffee in my keurig coffee maker there is no mess , easy as using the regular k kups , just throw away when you are done making your coffee love the convenience i have just place a 2nd order . 
this hemp oil is excellent stuff for real , if you are using fish oil , this actually has more omega 3 's and has many other medicinal values br combine this with hemp seeds \( in smoothies \) and you will notice a difference in any aches in your knees and your hair will shine and your body will be filled with antioxidants br anything hemp rocks you will not be disappointed in this product and it came on time and was packaged well \( 3 \) bottles for this price is a great value . 
i love salsa and have tried many on the market i served dippin fiesta at a recent sunday football get together and got rave reviews maybe the best salsa i have ever tasted and served if you want to taste the best , try this one . 
i do n't know what to say that others have not covered if you like potato chips you will like these get em on sale when you can and limit your intake if you can . 
annie 's has a great line of food , and this macaroni and cheese is great kids like it grown ups like it ! ! . 
these are very good they are very close to home made , but when i'm in a hurry , i really appreciate having them at hand . 
i keep pamela 's baking mix in a 7 gallon container with a spin on bucket seal lid in the pantry br br when i want to make pancakes or waffles to start the day right i take a cup or two of mix , add a teaspoon of vanilla extract , an egg and olive oil and i'm ready to go what i enjoy most about purchasing the 25 lb bag is that it is easy to store and keeps fresh for months , yet is accessible and consistent in performance br br for a special treat i like to add hemp seed on the top of the waffles during cooking and fresh blueberries and strawberries before topping off with agave syrup . 
these beef sticks have a great flavor and the price seems fair there is no label stating as to where this product needs to be refrigerated . 
some people mentioned the loose tea is difficult to filter br br use a french press made for coffee is a good option dilute concentrate to desire strength my favorite flavors are mango and passion fruit . 
heat 8 10 oz 2 or whole milk , not quite to boiling , in your microwave add 1 1 4 rounded teaspoons of ghirardelli mocha hot choc powder 1 1 8 rounded teaspoons of ghirardelli hazelnut hot choc powder , stirring to fully mix now add 3 4 oz christian brothers vs brandy \( optionally \) garnish with whipped cream or a small accent of vanilla ice cream and serve br notes not to be a brand whore , but christian bros \( vs , not the more expensive vsop \) is the only brandy i 've found to really have the right profile for this recipe exact proportions for all 4 ingredients should ultimately be to your own taste non fat and 1 milk are not recommended the brandy should contribute its flavor but not be so strong as to have an obvious alcoholic note i 've for many years used a 1 0 mocha 1 5 hazelnut ratio , but lately the mocha product has n't seemed as intense , so i 've adjusted you 'll know it 's right when the mocha hazelnut brandy flavors are in such balance that none is too dominant the result will be a new experience greater than the sum of its parts . 
i have been using this protein powder for about a month the first thing i noticed is that this brand mixes better than optimum nutrition egg protein , but still not like whey or even rice protein the texture is not great by itself in my opinion not awful but not great i have been mixing garden of eating super seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture i 've also tried blending the two with ice to make a smoothy which turned out ok for those of us who ca n't tolerate the whey or soy proteins , this particular brand is the best i 've found . 
i use a lot of various spices in my cooking and wanted to find a source with a quality product at a reasonable price frontier met that discription . 
i bought this dog food initally because i like everything that i have tried from newmans products for humans so , i thought that my pug , chloe may like newmans also well , she sure does , there is no turning up her nose at it i get it delivered regualry , so this negates the need to make a special trip to get dog food br br update 6 12 15 the last two bags i recieved had a mite in the foods which caused my dog to have severe bouts of diarrhea i only found out today when i took her to the vet , and was informed that these intestinal bugs were usually located in the dog food sure enough , when i got home and looked in the dog food , guess what i cfound on the bottom of the bag , tiny mites it went out into the garbage containers br br i will return to this dog food in a few months she ahs liked it so much , but will wait for a bit . 
i ca n't believe how wonderful this chip is ! the slightly spicy after taste gives the chip extra punch and flavor my family and i are offically addicted . 
i use this in combination with baby 's only formula for my daughter unfortunately , due to illness , my milk production took a plunge when she was 5 months old although , it breaks my heart that i can only nurse a little , i feel better using goat 's milk \( easy for baby belly 's to digest \) i add baby 's only so she gets the vital nutrients she needs if you are looking to supplement your child , consider using raw local goat 's milk \( if you are lucky enough to have it around \) this stuff is great . 
wellness pure delights are very tasty , moist and healthy that most of our finicky cats seem to enjoy definitely will buy more in the future . 
i 've always hated the peete 's or starbucks burnt bitter taste this is a great blend , still strong without the burn roasting br br fyi , low quality beans are burned to hide it 's bad taste . 
these chips are some of the best i 've tasted they are not filled with chemicals you taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato not greasy perfectly crispy if you do n't like salt and vinegar tanginess , do n't even bother to try these definitely have zip i love them my children and their friends love them even my 4 year old loves them ! . 
i like carbonated fruit juices and i think this one is fine it has a more tangy formula than the name suggests it 's more of a light fruit punch it 's refreshing and a good serving size , in my opinion it 's wonderful to have something that does n't contain high fructose corn syrup ! what 's here instead is 100 juice \( filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates , apple , grape , tangerine , orange and acerola juice concentrates \) , gum acacia , natural flavors and colors , ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) , contains soy delicious sweet light fruity tangy yum . 
stores are not carrying this product thank goodness i can still get them ! ! ! ! a href http www amazon com gp product b000cmhmuc genisoy soy crisps , deep sea salted , 3 85 ounce bags \( pack of 12 \) a . 
tastes great , and gives me energy without the jitters love this product br however , i do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip lock pouch because the zip lock ripped off and quit working after awhile but the product is fantastic , just not crazy about the packaging . 
i really like this hot chocolate mix i was concerned , when i read some of the reviews , that i would not like it but i like it alot to me it has just the right amount of chocolate and is not to sweet i would recommend this product . 
this product is great for pancakes for baked goods i blend bisquick \( 2 3 part \) with pamela 's bread mix \( 1 3 part \) for great gluten free dairy free treats the bread mix makes it less crumbly . 
great tasting coffiee ! ! one of the best i 've ever had ! the problem here is the high shipping costs . 
these chips are a great snack if you do n't want all the junk assiciated with chips try them you 'll like them . 
light and flavorful definitely describes this k cup i often find it hard to find flavored k cups that are n't either 1 \) so strong you lose the flavor or 2 \) so light you 'd be better off drinking water however , i have to admit i have found a new favorite in the hawaiian hazelnut ! . 
my cats \( 7 of them \) love this food so i was glad to see amazon is carrying it again the local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag , only the 3 5lbs and 12 lbs this food is sealed very well , and is fresh i have tried expensive brands and really cheapo brands of cat food , and so far 9 lives agrees very well with my cats this food does not rifle through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors \( like cheapo cat food \) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy my cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old , and believe me , this 9 lives brand and flavor are something they all like the price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free br br i also buy the iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love again , no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now br br if you do try this , or switch your cat \( s \) over , be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust in the end , i think you will be very pleased with the quality and price br br also , we used to take in foster cats , and fed them this 9 lives brand , and they all did very well . 
thank you for this product we use it all the time and appreciate your promptness and the price was excellent thanks again . 
our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old , and the solid gold food i 'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago \( with no notice on the packaging \) , and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets after the contaminated food scare even tho solid gold was not recalled , i decided to switch , and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight newman 's own is a brand i totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years after a year on this food , my dog is doing fine , but i do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat that may be age related as well but the stomach upsets have stopped and i feel better knowing i am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula . 
if you do n't have the time to cut up ginger and boil it for it 's wonderful flavor here 's an alternative this tea is refreshing true ginger flavor and punch is wonderful . 
i 've always liked salt and vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag not with these , the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until you 've finished the bag these are very addictive if you like salt and vinegar , these are the ultimate chips nothing else compares . 
these are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many they have the best potato flavor they came when you said they would . 
i tried this flavor within a variety pack and loved it ! i usually add cream and sugar to my coffee with this k cup i added coconut creamer and found that i did not have to add any sugar ! it was so sweet and light and tasted just like a pina colada i absolutley love this k cup and am planning to sign up for subscribe and save on this one ! . 
i had bought small cans previously and they arrived inadequately packaged , so they all had tiny dents these , however , arrived undented , well packaged in bubble wrap i have not yet opened them , but i have used the small cans this oil is great quality , and the price is not overblown recommended . 
this gravy is great ! 1 4 cup has only 50 calories and 6 grams of carbs , which has helped my husband loose over 20 pounds how \? well the low carbs helped , but the main feature that makes low cal low carbs part of the formula work , is the great taste this gravy has got a peppery tang that makes it just right for spicing up eggs or chicken or anything else you might through a white pepper gravy over br br and i do n't know if you have tried other packaged sauces , but i have , and generally they are n't very good even when freshly made worse , these sauces tend to get 'strange' in the fridge overnight \( oddly watery , or jell like yuck \) this s m gravy mix does n't do that , which means that it 's good for several meals br br highly recommended for the gravy challenged my southern reared husband is a content and thin br br pam t br mom , reviewer at large , and wife to gravy lover . 
i have been very pleased with this variety pack of baby food the pack contains three each of pears , peaches oatmeal banana , apples and apricots , and peaches bananas and raspberries my 6 1 2 month old daughter loves all of them , especially the peaches bananas and raspberries ! i have been very satisfied with earth 's best with one exception the metal lids have a lining that contains bpa \( as do all lids on glass babyfood jars \) , so if you 're set on staying away from bpa , you 'll want to get your baby food from companies that make pouches , like happybaby and plum organics i make a lot of my own babyfood , so i feel that feeding her some food from glass jars is acceptable , especially for varieties that i ca n't make i do also buy a lot of happybaby , and i'm very satisfied with the quality there also all in all though , a very nice variety of good tasting fruits ! . 
i need every color that is available ! love this product ! ! received shipment very fast ! very happy with this product , will buy more . 
first time buyer of ka me rice crackers and i'm very impressed these are very light , crisp and flavorful they are as good plain as they are with cold cuts , fruit , etc unfortunately , the ones i purchased may be the last i get from this source right after i purchased the dozen packs , the price per dozen increased 44 to its present 37 99 fortunately , i have enough to last a while , but assuming the price stays the same , these are my last ka me . 
i absolutely love lana 's snowflake tea ! i received a sample when i ordered the finum permanet filter through amazon \( which , by the way , is the best filter i have ever used ! \) i fell in love with the snowflake tea and had to order some for myself it 's fantastic ! . 
and a great price from amazon my wife and i had dinner last night at a very high end restaurant and while everything was magnificent we both thought the coffee was n't as good as our yuban i often wonder about starbucks whose coffee i find undrinkable my son says it 's an acquired taste . 
i love the crunch taste of the corn strips my whole family loves them too ! . 
i was introduced to this product a few years ago and was floored by how tasty and depending on the amount and type of milk added \( 2 or whole \) , how chocolaty the flavor could even be i 've recently moved and do n't know where to find it locally so i'm trying the online purchasing option i'm almost out of it ! br br this is a very nice option for those of us who do n't drink coffee all that often but want to have something of quality in the kitchen cupboard goes great with trader joes hot chocolate powder too . 
i have been on gf diet for a month and it 's hard to find food that taste good or even close to what i used to eat but when my husband found bisquick gluten free at the store , the issue of what to eat for breakfast never came up actually my husband eats the gf pancakes wnow even if he does n't need a gluten free diet the pancakes are lighter and very tasty just follow the box directions . 
i mix 2 scoops of this and two scoops of formula in my son 's bottle and it keeps him full longer my mother says she used it on me when i was a child and it kept my cheeks rosy and me full my son seems to really enjoy it . 
not really much to say about the product other than it arrived similar to as pictured and works as described i used it as a natural stabilizer for doughnut icing which was excellent american wholesale got it to me in 4 days i purchased 2 oz usa product . 
its nice to have a 'treat' to give my kids that they feel like they are getting soda they love the taste and i do n't feel like i'm having to compromise any quality br i do n't enjoy soda but i do enjoy this product and occasionally will grab a can great product at a good price ! . 
i rarely want to eat much when i first arise in the morning but i do have coffee i 've found that these cinnamon graham crackers work great for me as a little something to eat along with my coffee they are graham crackers not anything super duper amazing but they are nice , cinnamony graham crackers that are organic . 
these are the best sunflower seeds ever the bigger size makes them easier to eat load of flavor in every bag ! . 
i love these chips and they are a perfect low fat snack to keep me held over through my day the only thing bad about the amazon price is they are about 20 for a 24 pack that is 80 cents each sadly i discovered this great snack at work in the vending machine for 75 cents i would expect to buy them for 50 a pack if i have to buy 24 and not from a vending machine i highly recommend these chips , but there is no savings buying the from amazon . 
i brought 2 bottles one i carry in my pocket and the other for home i fell in love with this while on vacation in belize just a couple drops does the trick packs a ton of flavor , but not too hot that it overpowers your food . 
we were looking for a tasty , spicey gravey mix when searching the internet we saw this item and br decided to try it what a lucky find it is all we anticipated and more , being easy to prepare as well br as tasty and spicey now we need look no further when we run out we know where to go to order br it . 
these sahlen's smokehouse hotdogs are totally yummy they have a lighter flavour than the all beef hotdogs i am used to and are not as unduly salty ! the delicious smoked taste is there , all right but it is not overpowering , and will not burn your tongue ! just a nice , subtle flavour and this all means not only are they delicious , but also that you wo n't go looking for gallons of water , \( or soda , or whatever \) , after you eat a few br br these are big , substantial hot dogs if you want yours in a hot dog bun , it will probably not only fill the bun , but some of the hot dog will stick out at either end ! br br if you wnat to take the wrapping \( skin \) , off the hot dog , this is not easily done but then , it 's not easily done with any of the other hot dogs i 've ever tried , either but it is easier to take off at least part of the plastic wrapping and just the plastic wrapping , leaving the hot dog itself , totally intact with thes sahlen 's smokehouse hotdogs , than it has ever been my experience with any other hot dogs \( maybe if i had more patience , i would indeed have been able to take more of or even all of the plastic wrap off but these hot dogs are so yummy , such will , i fear , never be the case ! \) br br these hot dogs are conveniently wrapped two together so you will not be taking the entire contents out , when you want just one , or two at least , you wo n't do this inadvertently but once tasting these delightful hot dogs , you may be sorely tempted to do this deliberately br br br br on one of oprah winfrey 's earliest programs , she and some guests went to a very br elite restaurant spagos i'm sure i'm not the only audience member who had never head of spago 's before then recently , i learnt that pizza at spagos is br filled with smoked salmon ! this makes spago 's pizza the non plus ultra of pizzas , i'm sure ! br br for non plus ultra , \( absolutely no better \) hot dogs , sahlen's smokehouse hot dogs , just have to be the ones sahlen 's has been making , \( and probably , perfecting \) , hot dogs , since 1869 , \( 140 years \) so , for the ultimate hot dog , on a par with spago 's pizza , \( for pizza \) , tetley 's classic blend , \( for tea bags \) , maxwell house arabica blend decaf instant coffee , \( for instant coffee \) , guylian chocolate sea shells , \( for chocolate \) , and other such top of the tastebuds foods , it 's sahlen's smokehouse hotdogs , for hotdogs br br yes they are that good ! . 
jamaica me crazy has a slight overtone of cinnamon that is a very nice compliment to the taste of coffee the flavoring is strong enough to taste , not just smell , without overpowering the flavor of the coffee very good . 
i had never made this or had it at a mexican food diner , so i did not know what to expect it is good and very moist , but if you use creamed corn with added sugar in it your muffins or corn loaf will be very sweet i will make my own cream corn to add next time instead of using libby 's canned cream corn which is high in salt and sugar i like sweets but this was a little over the top using canned cream corn the first ingredient in the dry mix is sugar , not corn masa as listed on the amazon site so be advised this is definitely a dessert . 
i love really good coffee and , in fact , go to great lengths to brew the best i e freshly ground beans , purest water , immaculate coffee maker , etc i have been extremely happy with virtually all of jeremiah 's coffees and , i have a number of different beans on hand at all times the breakfast blend is stand out also , try this and their fogbuster you will not be disappointed aaaa . 
this is by far the best k cup hot cocoa we have tried it has a nice rich flavor and with the added convenience of a k cup , it is easy to have a cup anytime you like highly recommend ! . 
my dogs love this natural kibble it 's simple \( only rice and protein \) yet tasty they maintain a healthy weight and have regular and healthy bowl movements wellness is a fantastic product for dogs because they keep in mind the many ingredients that are not natural to a dog 's diet and keep it out of their food . 
i tasted this snack at my local pub and found it tasty much better than chips or other mixes i was told it was sold in sam 's club and wegman 's for 18 per 30 0z container bought it from utz in a 4 pack for 41 00 br each piece has a different taste and texture could not ask for a more delicious snack or a better price thank you utz ! . 
i do n't know why , because it does n't look very appetizing , but my two dachshunds love this stuff and scarf it down with great abandon . 
i have n't owned a portable fence for horses until now , but i am impressed and liking this product very much upon opening the package i was happy with the portability of the carrying bag , and shocked at how lightweight and compact this system is it 's a great accessory to throw in the trailer when taking the horses out , or just to have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses once set up , it wo n't hold more than two of our horses comfortably i do n't think we 'd ever try and manage to get 4 inside like the product advertises ! br br the instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it i can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well \( such as alpacas \) , but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them the step in posts are fantastically designed , the overall design makes the fence very versatile , setting up easily pretty much anywhere your horse an go br br we 're very happy with it 's design and portability and will get a lot of good use out of this system , i think ! . 
it works i took one , 2 minutes later i was trying different things in my mouth last thing im trying right now is beer and it taste different and sweat if your into trying new things give these a try i read that it wont work on some people but well chalk this as a did work for me review . 
very good side dish , easy to make , easy to eat as others have said , needs a little spice , but other than that they are delicious ! . 
raw , organic , fair trade , tastes great what 's not to love \? my hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit . 
i'm not from the south , but live in sofla where sometimes we get a southern influence the gravy mix i am reviewing , pioneer country gravy is de licious ! ! ! i 've tried others publix brand , mc cormick , ect , but this is the best ! by far ! i chose to mix 1 2 water 1 2 milk , 2 cooked , chopped sausage links , and it was phenomenal on my bisquick cheese garlic bisquits \( like red lobster 's \) , served with a small side of watercress scrambled eggs it 's super easy to make and thick ! finger lickin ! mmmmmmm i heard you can put it on potatoes veggies and chicken , make soups and add for seasoning pioneer brand as the name says is a homestyle , american classic ! . 
i got this after a mention in the ny times and immediately became an addict it 's a little hot but not too much , and it has an amazing depth of flavor a lot more than the plain version i use it in chicken salad to cut back on the amount of mayo , to add flavor to blah soups and as a substitute for a lot of the oil in salad dressings a little bit over steamed veggies and added to yogurt over baked potatoes \( instead of sour cream \) is also great . 
i was never going to give my children formula after my first child was born i did not produce enough milk and had to supplement we tried all different types of formula from many name brands unfortunately he had adverse reactions to everything we tried , including soy products we finally tried organic similac this was by far the most expensive , so we started with the powder this stayed down he did n't have any reactions \( rashes , hives , throwing up , etc \) after a couple of months he began spitting up a little powdery substance \( guess we did n't mix well enough \) we then tried the premixed similac organic voila ! perfect no adverse reactions , he was happy healthy br br we 've had 2 more children both have also used the premixed organic similac neither of them have had an problem with the formula according to the doctor they are all very healthy children to me that is what 's most important \) . 
we ordered this on our doctor 's recommendation and take a tablespoon every day as a supplement it 's supposed to have several omega acids also tasty on salads . 
i am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when i bought the sampler pack of jamaica me crazy i honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee the aroma that it gives off while brewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere the flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all a great new addition to my coffee line up . 
i bought this gift pack and really enjoyed it the hottest hot sauce in the pack is so darn hot it had me burning for about 30 minutes and washing my mouth out with water for 10 other than that one , all the others were really good the wooden case does n't hold the bottles well but the sauces were good i would buy it again . 
i feed my two pugs and occasional rescue newman 's advanced dog formula i like this better than the regular newman 's , because it has less ingredients i supplement with high quality can food , organic free range chicken , healthy powder and salmon oil my boys are healthy their coats are amazing highly recommend but with supplements see above . 
my chiweenie was having issues with dandruff , constipation and a dull coat we researched different dog foods and bought newmans own for active or senior dogs in about 3 weeks , its like having a brand new dog he is so soft , dandruff free , having healthy 'movements' \) and he loves the food i can give him a piece of it as a treat and he really thinks it is , ha ha moral of the story , we will never go back to bargain brand for just a little bit more our dog is healthier , softer , happier and its worth it . 
this has been the best tasting stevia i have tried i also think this is a better value than some of the others i really like not having to open all the packets when i make a gallon of tea . 
i like the jamaica me crazy better , but when it 's out of stock , this is my second choice br br it 's got a nice flavor strength , without being bitter . 
i love this brand ! the best hazelnut flavor ever ! i wait for it to go on sale because it is more expensive than the other brands also , as another reviewer noted , it does say decaff on the bottom of the package ! it really should state that in the product description i 've noticed the packages from bed , bath and beyond did not state this but ca n't imagine both are available i 'll still purchase it because the flavor is so smooth . 
i purchased this item to bake some low carb cookies for a diabetic friend this works well for that , however , i did find that there is another brown sugar alternative that is calorie free both options worked well in the cookies . 
wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut coffee for keurig brewer good medium strength coffee with hazelnut flavor full body , enjoyable anytime of the day i really like this coffee . 
i 've now tried several of the switch drinks they 're not bad , for a carbonated juice drink , especially this , actually , was one of the better flavors i 've tried it 's got a nice orange juice type flavor that i enjoyed ultimately , these drinks remind me of apple beer , which is essentially carbonated apple juice i love that drink , and think switch could try an apple version of their product i'm sure i 'd love it as well br br that being said , give it a try it will quench your thirst , and i'm sure it 'll do well in the marketplace it fills a void where very few drink manufacturers have entered . 
our family loves spam and amazon makes it so easy and such a great deal to buy in bulk the 7 ounce size is perfect for our use amazing what you can use spam for add it to all your favorite recipes in place of other meats ! super convenient to have it come in automatic shipments without having to give it a second thought ! . 
tried this because it is 100 kona and much cheaper than the other national brands i have been using what can i say i am greatly surprised mild , no bite too it and no discernable acidity this is on my shopping list from now on . 
like the other people mentioned , this coffee has a great taste i 've tried different instant coffees before , but this one is one of the better ones another one of my favorites , if you want to try it out \( though not organic \) , is 'africafe pure instant coffee' . 
i loooove this product i use it a lot on my salads , vegetables and to season meats delicious ! ! ! . 
comical that this is considered a 'toy' i bought these as a decoration for a circus themed baby shower and they arrived in perfect condition i used them in vases surrounded by colored crinkle cut paper and used as centerpieces on the buffet table lots of compliments i have kept them and plan to use again for future parties these will not be consumed so no idea how they taste . 
this is the only oatmeal that my family will even consider eating i make it in the crock pot overnight and it is always ready when we are i use my small crock pot for the two of us i start with a 1 2 cup of oatmeal add a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla add a 1 2 cup of milk and 2 cups cold water place the lid on the crock pot and plug it in it will be ready in the morning when you are i let mine cook approx 10 hours my small crock pot has no settings just off or on we love to add some brown sugar and dried blueberries or craisins at the table . 
the coffee i ordered is great if you want a sweet coffee this is for you . 
these smell so good i'm tempted to try them myself ! i have to keep real chocolate locked up in my house because my two chocoholic dogs will raid cupboards and chew open drawers to get to it , but they are very happy with these instead i'm so glad i found this safe alternative for them . 
i 've long been a fan of flavored coffees so when we got our keurig brewer we jumped on the opportunity to sample as many different flavors of k cups as possible our first foray into the single serve hazelnut world was a href http www amazon com gp product b0029xdzki gloria jean 's coffees , hazelnut k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers \( pack of 50 \) a , which was absolutely awful we 've always enjoyed hazelnut coffee in the past , though , and vowed not to give up i ordered a sample pack of wolfgang puck 's hazelnut directly from keurig 's website and hoped for the best br br thankfully , hawaiian hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water it is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming the hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut , which you 'd think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted , but we 've been disappointed in the past i 'd never tried coffee from the wolfgang puck brand before , but our positive experience with hawaiian hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties br br the hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied , which is nice , but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found this suits me just fine since i enjoy a milder roast , but people who enjoy their coffee strong and dark might not enjoy this blend as much br br we 'll definitely be repurchasing this coffee when we run out . 
switch is a fantastic replacement for sodas you still enjoy having the carbonation but with fruit juice it is very satisfying . 
wow , i have to admit these are really yummy i do n't know how they did it , but they do n't have that imitation sugar taste at all they 're small little bars \( slightly bigger than the normal hershey 's miniatures \) , but for only 30 calories a piece , they are a perfect afternoon treat when you need something sweet at the office . 
bought this as a joke to give to a friend that is a beer connisseur \( sp \) for his dog the dog did n't really care one way or the other and tried to give some to my dog and he also turned up his nose not sure , but it appears to have a very salty , brothy smell that could be the reason for the turned up doggy noses however , it was cute to put into staged pictures of the dogs with the plastic bottles looking like they were hung over , along with their master ! . 
this coffee has a good flavor and a good strength at first it seemed strong but then i got use to it i recommend this flavor coffee good wake up in the morning . 
honestly , i have to admit that i expected a little better that 's not to say that this is bad coffee in fact it 's quite bold without being too acidic , and pretty satisfying overall i think my main problem is that wolfgang puck 's name is attached to it , so perhaps it set my expectations a little high i have a wolfgang puck knife set that i adore , and is very high quality for what i paid for it this coffee was on sale , so it was well worth it also , i just hoped for something that would knock my socks off which it did n't i also purchased the breakfast blend , and jamaica me crazy at the same time the breakfast blend was the best , in my opinion , and the jamaican coffee smelled the best , but was the least successful . 
it 's very delicious and i love salty foods but i wish that contains olive oil instead of safflower oil \( . 
i tried this coffee on a half dozen quests this weekend and they all loved it for those that like their coffee mild , i brewed 7 oz cups for those of us that like it bold , i brewed 5 oz cups br br as an earlier posted noted , it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees the taste is n't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee regular and black but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention br br i plan on trying all of wolfgang 's line wish he 'd offer a variety pack . 
i 've never heard of the safcol brand before but i was tired of only trying the typical pouches starkist and chicken of the sea i was really surprised as i thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning . 
childhood nostagia all over again ! i love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches , but i do n't often make them because they 're rather messy these bars solve that problem the oats and stuff provide a perfect compliment to the peanut butter and jelly flavor that 's in the bar the best part is that i can eat this on the go and not have to worry about my hands or clothes getting messed up . 
i never drank coffee in my life received a gift of ghiradelli chocolate flavored coffee for christmas searched on line and found this dark chocolate decadence it is the absolute best have it on bi monthly subscription order now with amazon if you are a fan of dark chocolate this is a wonderful coffee very smooth with just a hint a dark chocolate in the background delicious sweetened with honey and milk also divine with almond milk or vanilla soy milk coffee masters make wonderful coffee . 
the toasted flavor is so much better than regular walnut oil the price is the best i can find and we store it in the fridge for longer life . 
more iron than turmeric but this is a very nutty tasty spice that i mix with all other spices this is one of the main ingredients in most indian curry powders bravo . 
love these chips they are perfectly seasoned and of course have no grease at all there is also not the cardboard taste of a baked chipped the popped texture of the potatoes is nice and light they are only 100 calories a bag , but there are lots of chips in the bag so it 's a great snack the ingredient list is also pretty wholesome without any strange chemicals added fav flavor is probably salt and pepper or bbq . 
this is my favorite of all the coffees i 've tried smooth and flavorful without being a flavored coffee , its a definite treat anytime of day . 
my son really enjoys all these flavors eats them all ! ! ! fast shipping no shopping in stores great prices would recommend to all . 
it was so easy to grow and my cat loved it i highly recommend this purchase your cat will love you forever ! . 
i have managed to find these crackers in other countries on our travels but had run out i love that they are individually wrapped small packets in a stay fresh container this makes them great to carry in my purse , take to work or on airplanes for snacks etc also love that they are not overly salted like so many american brand crackers company that shipped them did a great job fast too ! . 
this coffee has a smooth , carmely , dark finish that i love ! my husband gets other dark blends that taste like charcoal to me this one is very smooth , with just a hint of sweetness i wish that amazon had it on its monthly purchase program , would love to save 15 on it ! however , i was glad to find it someplace besides green mountain as prime members , we can get our coffee replaced in 2 shipping days v a week or longer over at gm sweet ! . 
if you have been out to philmont on a treck or as staff these are given to you in your trail meal they are organic and made of honey they good and healthy a . 
i tried this brand first and i must admit i became spoiled because subsequently i went to whole foods to try and buy a bunch more i had to get navitas and found they were smaller , drier and less flavorful so here i am this brand 's golden berries are large , with a wonderful more succulent texture the only problem is sometimes i get the seeds stuck in my teeth ! they have tiny white seeds like raspberries but the berry itself resembles a large golden raisin the flavor is very strong and captivating like a lemon with the tartness strength of a cranberry within days of incorporating golden berries into my diet i have noticed my insides are thanking me golden berries are naturally very anti inflammatory they have an addicting flavor that i will gladly continue to feed into . 
my vodka tonics have never been so refreshing i wish i would have ordered two cases now as my husband and i are going through far too much . 
my wife is on the low carb diet , well we are on the low carb diet which means small breakfast if you do not have time to make eggs and bacon it is hard to get the coffee down without peanut butter she says we have been using crackers like these kavli crispbreads to get down the peanut butter since before i can remember i think it was when dan and mary eads published protien power plan in the late 1990s many years ago we found these to be the best we could only find them in wegmans grocery store in ne pennsylvania , and now that the army has moved us \( again \) to fort knox , ky we can only find them at kroger recently we cannot seem to find them there either , so we order them they come fast , not broken , and they are fresh also , they are not any more costly to purchase online and pay for delivery than to waste time looking for them one note my wife hates opnening things , and we found the best way to do so with these is to cut off the end of the cellophane \( \? \) with scissors prevents cracks of this thin bread ! . 
i originally found this roasted garlic juice at one of those roadside shops that sell a variety of foodstuffs , plants and ice cream that was about a year ago and unfortunately , the place is now out of business i was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on amazon , as i could n't find anything even close at any grocery store in a 50 mile radius store managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice i told them if they carried it , they would sell a lot br br i have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor ca n't be beat ! it is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine i prefer the roasted over the cold pressed , but both are great in their own way it 's nice to be able to pour or spray br br bottom line if you are a garlic lover , buy this ! ! ! ! ! . 
i 've eaten a lot of sardines in my life and by far these are the best the extra cost of boneless skinless is worth it cos there is more to eat and less waste love the water packed instead of the gooeyness of oil excellent . 
i love all of joray 's flavors watermelon is my favorite ! joray 's fruit rolls are more natural than other fruit snacks . 
super good price and the best k cup cocoa we have found br br i am glad i found this for our family before the big cocoa season hits ! br br love it . 
hubby had to switch to gluten free because of gluten intolerance so we tried this and made pancakes they were great and had sort of a corn bread texture to it fyi i made cobbler from an regular bisquick recipe \( not gluten free \) and the measurements do not transfer the proportions are different with the gluten free mix so make sure you have the right recipe for what you 're making . 
i have 3 cats 2 could care less the other one loves this so much i have it by their food bowls and she nibbles on it every day no throwing up like outside grass . 
what can you say about coffee , either you like it or you do n't i liked this coffee , although when i choose to review it i did n't notice it was decaf that aside , it tastes fine \( made in my keurig \) but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one . 
i grew up using this seasoning on steak , and pretty much everything could no longer find it in stores so ordered a case off amazon very happy nice spice and flavor highly recommend . 
although a little pricey , these are a great way to give your cat a healthy treat my cat has a sensitive stomach and cant always eat the treats i have gotten for him without him throwing up i stopped using grocery store treats and moved to natural balance but they were too much for his tummy , but these treats he absolutley loves and he never gets sick afterwards also , with the all natural ingredients i feel good about rewarding him br \( p s since they are natural ingredients they are stinky like salmon \) . 
it took a couple of tries to figure out how to snap on the cap and a couple of tries to tell how much coffee to put in it for the strength preferred after that , it is economical and not much trouble . 
we go through a lot of dressing and my husband has to have this brand only , so i saw this and said great ! . 
every revolution product i have tried has been a wonderful experience revolution knows how to balance the inherit flavors of tea leaves with other ingredients which make each tea unique and enjoyable br br better than the rest br br i 've been buying this particular tea consecutively for the better half of a year now , and i simply love it no other pomegranate tea comes close to this one in terms of quality and taste for example , trader joe 's store brand \( while good \) seems as if it has been sweetened \( to the point where it 's too sweet \) , and surprisingly the tea turns red after less than a minute of seeping indicating that coloring was added \( i did n't check the ingredients , so i may be wrong about this \) there 's also yogi 's pomegranate tea which uses a green tea and creates an entirely different taste i liked it did n't love it br br complimenting flavors br br pomegranates are often compared to apples in fact , pomegranate means seeded apple \( from latin pomum apple and granatus seeded \) , and like an apple the fruit is sweet and tart , but has a very strong and distinct flavor thus , a light white tea is the perfect companion it does n't overpower the pomegranate flavor but allows it to mingle on the tongue likewise , the amount of pomegranate , or rather the intensity of the pomegranate flavor , is truly perfect no flavor overpowers the other , but rather all the flavors compliment one another br br brewing br br i'm sure someone out there will say that i'm butchering tea when i brew this , but when i do , i leave the tea bag in the mug until i 've consumed it all i find that the taste never gets too strong and never gets bitter typically this is only the case for herbal teas , which do n't become overpowered since they contain no tea leaves in this case the same is true , perhaps because it is a white tea which is naturally light the tea itself literally contains dried pomegranate seeds \( flesh included \) do you know that taste you get a few moments after you eat a pomegranate seed \? \( if you do n't , try it ! it 's wonderful \) that initial bite from the tartness followed by sweetness you get \( or at least i get \) from a pomegranate is captured in this tea , and it makes sense ! there 's pomegranate seeds in there ! br br conclusion br br buy this tea ! i was a little skeptical about my first purchase since i was buying 6 boxes , but it was a great choice that i do not in the least bit regret i 've bought this for myself and for family , with everyone absolutely loving it best 20 i have ever spent \( and continue to spend \) ! . 
this will be great with all that i use it for br thanks , linda . 
this product was difficult to find in stores but easy to find through amazon i will order items by this method again . 
great coffee this was way too much to pay for it , but i could not find it anywhere else at the time i feel a taken advantage of price wise and probably would not order again . 
the tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor it is clean and really fresh ! perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich br br the spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup i have ever tried it is so good i have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy ! . 
my neighbor and i love this candy and it 's difficult to find the 1 7 oz packets in the stores so i just decided to purchase a whole case they were fresh and great tasting . 
for canned soup this is very good clam chowder those who give it 1 or 2 stars are comparing it to homemade soup or restaurant style soup i would buy this any day over other brands you can tell it is all natural and without loaded msg , salt and other nasty ingredients pure and clean soup those who rate it badly , some say it has no flavor or there are n't chunks in it the flavor is mild , but that is good not overwhelmingly clammy and not over salted like conventional brand canned soup if i want to , next time i will add a potato cut up in chunks to boost it 's contents not a big deal to do i would prefer to do that than buy a conventional brand that does n't care about healthy ingredients and sourcing of ingredients i will buy this again good source of iron as well . 
i have tried many different brands and flavors of k cup coffees and i have to say , this one is one of the best i have ever had i would strongly recommend it it is very hard to find so buy it if you can get it at a good price . 
there is so many different k cup to chose from so i asked in the store what brand and flavor is bought the most they suggested wolfgang puck coffee breakfast in bed the only had a few on the shelf and i was not disappointed now i am hooked for you people that use creamer , this coffee is so good you will not even need creamer . 
great product to start your am with as its not too strong but just the right tast for your morning wake us up . 
this coffee says medium roast but is actually a little stronger we loved it and it has become our favorite if you want some coffee to caffeine you up , this is the one for you ! ! also , wolfgang puck 's breakfast in bed is great not so strong ! . 
i have a german breed , g sheph he is very , very , picky ! he loved them he is such a happy camper he wakes up in the morning ready to go for his walks comes home straight to his treat cabinet , he wants his chicken stix thank you , finally something that my boy loves . 
i really like the flavor of this hot chocolate the kids love the flavor too i always keep a box of this in the house as my kids and their friends are avid coco drinkers this makes it easier and less messy even for the younger ones no more powder spilled on the counter tops this way ! . 
the plant arrived in great condition fully green and with about five or six heads in the clear box that can serve as a terrarium will give it our best shot on keeping it up and running ! this was in much better shape than the venus flytrap plants at our local big box do it yourself in their garden area . 
very good very tasty and authentic flavor ! i ordered these last minute for christmas , not knowing if they were going to arrive on time they arrived at my house on christmas eve . 
i have celiac disease , and i try to keep the refined sugar to a minimum , and i was suprised by how good these are ! the light crunch is a shock at first , but is tasty it is a tad dry , so i am only giving 4 stars but the taste is great considering how healthy it is ! ! . 
we ordered these because we love our new keurig coffee maker , , , , but as we drink alot of coffee found that buying the kcups are way too expensive , , , , with these we can use our regular coffee in these disposable cups they are still not fun to fill , , , , \( not as easy as just reaching for a pre made one \) but are far more economical than the pre made ones they delivery was on time and as promised . 
this was a return buy i bought 50 to try and loved them this time i ordered 150 00 they are fab for your favorite coffee . 
if you love bbq oysters , this is the original west coast bbq sauce ! after 30 years , it 's nice to be able to buy this outside of pt reyes . 
i have this strong flavorful mahogany coffee by caribou in my keurig i love the taste i do like strong coffee and this seems to be the right blend of strong to medium i use a vanilla diet supplement in the coffee every morning with a splash of torani sugar free syrup and there is breakfast on the move a href http www amazon com gp product b00474vpy0 caribou coffee , mahogany , k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers , 24 count a . 
this is a good deal for a flavor not often carried in the stores the honey berry flaver is a good thing , not being to mediciny and things of that nature yum . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b003diiz9o cesar softies grilled chicken flavor dog treat , 6 7 ounce bags \( pack of 6 \) a br my two little dachshund boys are giving these treats 5 stars br after their evening walk they head straight for the pantry and impatiently wait for me to open the door so that they may have their treats \( 2 each \) as a reward for being good . 
i am addicted to this candy will try not to order another batch for awhile ! ! ! this is my candy to eat on the ride home from work in traffic to keep me calm . 
this item has an awesome chocolate flavor i would recommend this product to anyone looking for hot chocolate for their keurig or any machine that uses k cups great product . 
highly recommended for those who appreciate a good dark roast coffee , wolfgang 's sumatra kopi raya excites the flavor buds and ignites one 's morning always a good start to any day . 
the switch orange tangerine is one of the most refreshing drinks that i have ever tried it is 100 pure orange and tangerine juice and the difference from the regular sodas is quite obvious right from the first sip it feels richer and tastier than any soda product out there after drinking it , you may never go back to regular sodas again it works well by itself or with a meal this may be an ideal substitute for sodas for kids , as it is a much more nutritious drink the only problem that i have is the size of the can at 8 3 ounces it may be enough for a kid , but you would need more than one of these to quench an adult 's thirst . 
i love this sampler of ghiradelli chocolate intense dark squares especially now that nutritionists recommend you have an oz of dark chocolate each day that is over 70 cacoa chocolate is a vegetable a friend reminded it 's a bean ! br br these chocolates are affordable , tasty , rich , intense , silky smooth and just the right size i love to serve them for after dinner the squares are fairly large and individually wrapped it 's great to have different amounts of cacoa depending on guests' tastes dark chocolate is an acquired taste for some of course , the darker the chocolate , the healthier so you can work your way up to the 86 cacoa great to have on hand for the holidays if you are on a diet and want a low calorie chocolate healthy treat , having these individually wrapped dilutes the temptation i'm happy with one square most days br br these are a great non guilty pleasure that are good for your health ! . 
i bought this product because my dogs were having accidents in the laundry room overnight i'm not sure how or why this works but it stopped them from peeing the dogs love em too . 
the tea tin is guarding the aroma very well br the taste is beautiful the malva flowers do soften the taste and the amount of bergamot is just right br the first time i used too much tea and soaked it for too long \( i used as reference darjeeling ftgfop first flush \) br since then i save on the quantity of tea leaves and soak the tea for only two minutes br a delight the best earl grey i ever had the price is very competitive . 
this is our favorite k cup at home mellow and flavorful br br also , i wanted to clear up the question of whether or not this is decaf it is not see the response i received from wp coffee br br is breakfast in bed k cup actually a decaf coffee \? br br thanks for reaching out to wolfgang puck coffee the breakfast in bed is not a decaf blend br br thanks br mandy m br customer service br wolfgang puck coffee . 
was very happy that the kids liked these ! we all liked them ! i bought this mostly for myself i made them with coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil that it calls for it was a yummy , healthy substitute will definitely be buying again . 
i ordered this about a year ago and have repeatedly ordered it since everyone i have shared it with has loved it so much they have also gotten right on amazon and ordered it also i mix it in my coffee , and when i am feeling particularly naughty , top it off with whipping cream delicious ! ! ! ! ! . 
vanilla beans typically run 6 10 dollars for two at major supermarkets those prices make me reluctant to use them in most dishes that call for them , and instead i use vanilla bean paste \( williams and sonoma sells a very good product \) but these beans are such a good deal \( less than a fifth the supermarket price \) that now i'm willing to use them with almost reckless abandon vanilla beans really do provide superior flavor to things like rice pudding and custards and vanilla ice cream , a more complex , more luxurious flavor than vanilla extract does these beans arrived fresh , fragrant , and tightly bagged they 're madagascar vanilla beans , considered by some cognoscenti to be inferior to tahitian beans , but not being one of the cognoscenti , i ca n't detect much difference at all this product has made me a fan of internet grocery shopping . 
my kids love brownies , but i could no longer by the regular brands in the grocery store with a good conscious i still wanted the convenience of a mix , though these fit the bill they first time i made them , they thought they tasted funny because they were so used to the processed crap now they eat them up and have gotten used to the flax taste i think they are yummy ! br these are in no way low calorie or low fat though instructions call for a lot of oil , eggs , and butter \( you can use earth balance and egg replacer if you 're vegan \) flax seeds also have a good amount of fat \( although the healthy kind \) i 've made them with olive oil before and they were just as good i 've also added extra organic cocoa powder to make them extra chocolatey , but they really do n't need it i love the chewy texture of the flax seeds there are very few ingredients , i could probably make the same brownies homemade , but it would be a pain to have to grind the flax seeds , etc these are easy and yummy even though they are not necessarily healthy from a calorie and fat standpoint , i can feel good about giving my kids treats that are n't loaded with processed crap . 
heavily touted by the reviews , decided to try mix is good , but not great probably would n't buy again . 
kettle chips spicy thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet , savory and spicy everything you 'd want in a good meal or better yet a potato chip since these are kettle cooked , the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over browned they are , however , sliced just perfectly , not too thick , not too thin , so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off the flavor is tremendous , although i would n't describe it as thai it 's more of a vague , sweet and tangy flavor with a kick , and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger if you like any spice at all , these really are not overly spicy , so most people can handle them the fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher 's snack cupboard . 
we have been buying cat grass for many years and this product is very well priced and works just as good as the expensive packages br br our cats have grown healthy and happy since they have this grass br br great seller delivered on time and product sold is exactly what we wanted and will purchase again . 
this is my family 's favorite hot cocoa brand the kids favorite flavor if mint chocolate . 
i'm so glad i found this seller i just purchased my keurig about a week ago and wanted to try some different flavors without committing to an entire box it was fun picking out all the flavors i wanted to try if you go over to her website , , there is a much easier to read list of flavors and types of coffee that she has in stock after purchasing , i immediately sent an email to the seller with my flavor requests i received an email response shortly after and everything was packed and ready to go less than three hours later ! how 's that for customer service \? and the shipping was lightning fast ! i just received my package today \( monday \) after ordering thursday night all cups are accounted for and i'm already enjoying one of the cups i received if you are new to keurig , or want to experiment with some new flavors , this is a wonderful way to pick exactly the ones you want ! . 
i have been having quaker oatmeal for yesrs until trying this today ! the texture and the taste are completely different from the pressed oat it worths cooking for half hour my son love it at the first bite ! my 8 month old baby is also love it ! i uaually cook the portion which will be enough for 2 3 days drop one spoon or two into the worm milk every morning to make my breakfast much more healthier ! this one is so good that it will be hard for me to go back to pressed oatmeal . 
this tea smells and tastes like christmas ! this has always been my family 's favorite tea for children 's \( and big kid 's \) tea parties . 
i have n't had a chance to try these out yet , but i thought i would go ahead and mention that i received 5 each of the following 7 flavors br br sweet rasberry black iced tea br southern sweet iced tea br sweet lemon iced tea br french vanilla iced coffee br nantucket blend iced coffee br gingerbread coffee br eggnog coffee br br fortunately i'm okay with this , as i was wondering how the gingerbread and eggnog tasted as well you might feel differently though , and might want to know since this seems to be the only variety pack of iced k cups . 
i have not tried this product personally , but my dog has , and he loves it , and is aging well he 's getting a bit grey , but is as bouncy as he ever was 10 years ago . 
these are very handy when fresh fruit is n't available i bought them for my 16 month old and i to enjoy , however they are a little too crunchy and sour for her to eat straight from the bag , maybe some of other the other dried just fruit varieties are less tart overall they are nice to have on hand , they lose some of their tartness when stirred in cereal or yogurt also good for baking . 
while working as a busboy in a high end resturant in the 1960 's the resturant ran low on coffee the manager sent me out to purchase yuban and only yuban saying it was the best ! i have been drinking yuban for nearly 50 years and have always found it to be an exceptionally rich , smoothe columbian coffee there can only be one ! yuban ! . 
it was as good , if not better , than i was told ! great taste ! i will puchase it again . 
these soy crisps are very filling and satisfying if you are looking for something with a great salty crunch , these are for you br br they are high in fiber and protein , and that is great if you are trying to watch your calorie intake br br i think they are great and recommend them highly . 
i have loved kettle brand sea salt and vinegar chips since the first time i tried them the fact that i was able to find them on line for such a great price , was wonderful i would definitely make the purchase again they are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich . 
water based sardines without salt is awwfuul not bad of a product here far superior to the types i normally purchase at stores . 
my goldendoodle is picky and likes to change up his food once in a while so i decided to try two other brands what a mistake br newman 's own is really the best my dog looks better , feels better , and the quality of food is very good do not do like i did and experiment around my poor dogs stomach stick with newmans . 
i love this product now that the holidaze are falling apon us and i am a diabetic it 's nice to be able to have treats that i can eat , and not feel deprived this is a great brown sugar sub it is the best i have tasted it works like regular brn sugar so if your on a diet or diabetic like me your prayers have been answered . 
this juice is actually concentrated as advertised of all the juice concentrates of any flavor i have tried , this one is the most concentrated , and i expected the others to be as concentrated but they were all thin i guess tart cherry juice tastes like fresh black cherries in general , but montmorency rtcj has the more tart best flavor ! . 
i try every asian salad dressing i can find br this is my favorite one for salads because of it 's delicate taste br my other favorite is newman 's own , low fat sesame ginger br the ginger in newman 's gives it a stronger flavor which is great br as a marinade or just sprinkle on rice and vege dishes . 
love this juice scheduled shipment is convenient and economical this is a very expensive beverage and any way to save some money on it , is worth it . 
i pass around favorable endorsements very seldom but this is one of those occasions br br i'm almost 69 and this bacon would be as almost identical to the bacon i ate if it were a bit saltier and had the rind left on br br if you want the old time southern bacon without all the salt and the rind , this is it br br i 'll admit i do salt the bacon just a tad before i fry it br br this is good stuff if you appreciate great bacon . 
i recently went to hawaii and bought tons of coffee it was such a pain to use the my k cup attachment on the keurig machine because i 'd have to dump it out and wash it after every use disposakups are a great alternative and work wonderfully with my machine ! it 's now super easy for me to use my own coffee ! the only drawbacks i have found is that you really have to fill the filter all the way up to get good flavor it leaks a little bit so the outside of the cup is a bit wet after using lastly , water moves through it a bit slower than normal k cups so brewing a cup takes a bit longer than normal i would still highly recommend this to anyone who wants to use their own coffee with their keurig machine ! . 
i received my box of assorted popchips a few days ago to support my weight watcher meal plan i absolutely love them and find that they fit in with my plan without hesitation i recommend all varieties of these chips what a great idea ! ! ! . 
now , we 're not big juice drinkers in this family we take apple juice or cherry juice and mix it with unflavored seltzer water because otherwise we find it too sweet this is the same it 's nicely carbonated , and it has a pretty authentic fruit taste , but it 's still too sickly sweet cut it half and half with unflavored seltzer and a little ice and you 'll be happy . 
i have a 7 yr old w food allergies and both he and my 3 yr old love these i have compared to several other cookie snack items made with no dairy eggs and i think we all liked these the best definitely a must have for restricted diets . 
i was so happy to find this product when it was first released ! i had used regular bisquick for years before being diagnosed with celiac disease this is just as versatile as the original pancakes , biscuits , dumplings , etc ! my family 's favorie is the pancakes , they are light and fluffy and have a lovely crispness to the outside br br my only reason for not awarding this 5 stars is the size of the box , it is small my family of 4 uses the entire box for saurday morning pancakes the box makes approximately 3 \( small \) batches of pancakes , we freeze the extra in single servings for weekday breakfasts i 'd love to see bisquick release a larger box but until then i 'll continue ordering the 3 pack ! a href http www amazon com gp product b004391dk0 bisquick pancake and baking mix , gluten free , 16 ounce boxes \( pack of 3 \) a . 
one problem with fun sized bagged candies is that they are lots of small products in individual wrapping , that means that you have that many more changes of something getting squished or ruined i 've always wondered when they 're cheaper than in regular stores or warehouses , if the quality is a little lower br br in this case i handed out a lot of the candies and while everything was eaten , there were some major problems with both of my bags of peanut m ms almost all of them were crushed and there were peanuts with a little bit of m m stuck to them and then a lot of m m dust the snickers were not squished and the twix sticks were all intact , so not sure what happened br br that being said , these deals that amazon are fantastic and they pack them very well definitely worth it if you need to buy it in bulk just , with all bagged candies , be forewarned that all the pieces may not come in totally intact . 
my 1 1 2 year old basenji jack russell mix loves this dog food he 's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since i switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year despite the higher cost of natural dog foods , i find that he eats significantly less of the natural balance dog foods and still stays happy and full on the normal dog foods , he 'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day \( the recommended serving for his size \) , whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1 1 2 cup of the natural balance dog food a day when you take this into account , you 're actually getting more bang for your buck with the natural dog foods since you do n't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods and a healthier , happier dog , to boot ! add in the fact that you can get free , 2 day shipping with amazon prime i'm sold ! ! . 
these are awesome as are all of wolfgang puck 's k cups the coffee is smooth , the cups brew perfectly , the taste is unbelievable ! my husband and i are hooked on these the price is great considering what amazing coffee this is ! ! . 
good kit , however using the f pack \( pear juice \) made it way too sweet , i ordered two more and intent to blend the kits , the second two with out the added pear juice . 
this coffee is the smoothest dark roast coffee i have ever tasted , and it was a pleasure to sip this full bodied coffee before breakfast and after dinner . 
this popcorn is much smaller than your average popcorn , and it is virtually hulless that is exactly what i was looking for in a popcorn because my 3 year old loves popcorn with 3 year old children , you have to be concerned with the hulls causing choking or hurting their tender gums my son has no trouble eating this popcorn it is soft and light , does n't get stuck in your teeth nearly as much , and has a great flavor br br this is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family i usually pop it in my 10 year old cheap hot air popper with no problems i get very few unpopped kernels another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping , but i have not experienced this problem \( it could depend on the popper , i suppose \) i have tried microwaving it in a paper bag , but i always seem to end up burning it i think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right , so i just stick with my hot air popper i get great popcorn every time ! . 
fabulous gift the blooming teas were lovely and unique packaging was beautiful and perfect for a gift . 
wolfgang puck 's chef 's reserve colombian \( dark roast \) is basically what they said it will be dark roast , but not too strong acidity is on a low side , but with plenty of pleasant taste at the same time you can drink this coffee black w o the need for the sweetener and or milk this coffee is in european tradition and will please many people i would recommend it after dinner , but not if you need a jolt to wake you up . 
i got these beans based on the good reviews and was n't disappointed i also got 70 beans in my pouch , nice moist and supple pods that will make a gallon of vanilla extract great beans for a great price ! ! ! . 
vanilla beans in our area cost 6 for one and up to 11 for two i like to make my own vanilla extract and i also like vanilla flavored sugar which requires whole beans i probably have a lifetime supply of vanilla beans now , but with amazon 's excellent price on this item , i can use them freely and order again if i need to thanks amazon ! . 
for those of you who like love black licorice , i seriously recommend this product i eat it because i love black licorice , and only recently found that what i have observed is now reported by nuitionists as well these is evidence that black licorice is an aid to those with constipation it comes in other flavors too , but the medicinal effects only come the black . 
this is a very unique gift for anyone chocolate is very good and the presentation is great great to take to a xmas party to give the host eveyone will be fighting to get to try a few and with 48 in the box it will go pretty far it is not strong but you get great flavor of the liquor filling . 
until i tried vienna coffee house , donut shop was the one i had on automatic monthly delivery vienna coffee house is a tad bolder than donut shop but very smooth without any bitterness from the first cup , i knew i had to switch . 
a coworker brought this yummyness into the office and i am so greatful i am not big beef jerky fan but this stuff totally falls under my much yum category . 
i took one of these tablets , and the results were instantaneous i drank some pure lemon juice , and it tasted like very sweet lemonade my sister then tried it and spat it out immediately i then tried a lime , which was delicious , and some cheese i do not usually like cheese , but i after eating a little bit i was amazed at how wonderful it tasted with the tablets i highly recommend this product , beacuse it will amaze you the moment you start tasting . 
i have ordered these raisins multiple times they are always great and arrive timely i ca n't go back to store bought chocolate covered raisins now ! love this product . 
i needed this for a no bake cheese cake and i do n't use gelatin , kind of creeps me out but it worked well for what i needed , be sure to read directions . 
the belgian dark chocolate is the best hot cocoa i 've ever had so far and my 4 year daughter agrees she pinicky about her chocolates preferring only to eat dark chocolate and this dark choco hot cocoa sure passed the test with her she prefers to drink it with just warm water instead of milk as using milk makes it taste like milk chocolate i do , too ! . 
my daughter loves these dinners there 's no other organic meat option at my grocery store , so we 're stuck with this one , but i do n't mind at all i think they 're great i agree that they are runny , but you can just thicken it with whole grain cereal , and problem solved \( turkey dinner is thick enough \) i also do n't understand why people complain that they are too sweet , or unhealthy first of all , if you do n't like the ingredients , buy something else second , i trust earth 's best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product third , the belief that if baby tastes sweet food , they will not eat regular food , is an old wife 's tale are you people saying that you do n't give your babies fruit and vegetables \? they are all sweet br the only reason i gave this particular item 4 stars instead of five , is the price i can buy it at my grocery store for 79 cents a jar here , they are being sold for over 91 cents and that 's at the sale price if you buy these at the regular price , it comes to 1 41 way too much ! . 
these tomatoes are perfect for italian recipes full flavor , not too acidic and very italian ! always the best choice for italian cooking . 
we were looking for a smooth , rich , non acidic , non bitter coffee when we came upon amazon 's reviews for yuban coffee well , we 've been buying yuban original roast ground coffee from amazon for about a year now , and folks , what can we say , it 's still the best tasting coffee around coupled with our marvelous bunn coffee maker \( also an amazon purchase \) which makes a fresh , hot pot of coffee in 3 minutes , it just does n't get any better than this br keep checking back weekly to see what the going price is \( it fluctuates up and down quite a bit \) and when you can catch it at a great deal , buy some you wo n't be disappointed . 
wolfgang 's rodeo drive does make a good ole cup of coffee it is on the same line as donut shop very good morning coffee to wake up with . 
these brownies are good , but the flax seed texture can be a real turn off to minimize it , i added a little whole wheat flour , splenda and cocoa big improvement and my guests never complained \( like they did the first time i made the brownies ! \) . 
i tried tiki cat variety pack and the only one my cats really ate well was the bora bora sardine cutlets in lobster consomme maybe one other flavor , i think the one with crab , they sorta ate , but definitely this one so , i ordered a couple packs of 12 small cans i feed them 1 can per day along with their dry food they also like weruva canned cat food and a new one called addiction canned cat food which so far they love all the flavors i got them my one skinny cat is super crazy over the lobster consomme part , but both cats eat it all nutritionally , sardines are really high in rna which is a building block and rna also contains the sugar ribose . 
i love the meadow so i guess this review is more about how much i adore this store , than it is about the salt \( which by the way is fabulous \) i got my order way faster than i expected , which was nice i would recommend purchasing anything from these amazing folks , and even better if you can visit their lovely store in portland this is one of the most romantic stores that exists opening my box of truffle salt , and smelling that fragrant scent , was just not as magical as walking into their gorgeous store filled with flowers , salt , chocolate and wine ah , it is a taste of heaven br br the salt 's great thanks meadow people . 
best coffee ever still have n't found anything i like better i have never tasted coffee this strong that was n't bitter at all kind of pricey when you start working out what it is costing you per pound but cheaper than buying directly from gevalia if this company started opening stores , starbucks and their bitter brews would go bye bye . 
i switched to sea salt a couple of years ago and have found these mccormick grinders very handy ways of dispensing my attraction was the price this deal is better than any i have found in local grocery stores even with shipping handling well worth the price shipment was fast , no breaking or damage this is one of those 'more bang for your buck' deals worth it ! . 
when i feel that i do not need more caffine , i have found that the wolfgang puck decaf is a great substitute i really ca n't tell the difference , taste wise i had been having trouble finding a good decaf i think this one is it . 
great for risotto creates creamy finished product , while maintaining a good 'al dente' bite , better than any other rice i have used . 
over a year ago i purchased a breville k cups brewer and immediately found the the available selection and choices to exceed what i had expected i loved using it and brewing what i wanted , 1 cup at a time i found that i was paying about 40cents cup and that was also great br now the prices have soared to nearly or over 1 cup and that has made me slow down my purchase rate and my enjoyment of my single cup brewer br br enter the disposakups and suddenly the price is reasonable again and i can grind my own or purchase ekobrew and use their coffees these are so simple , convenient and easy that i really enjoy that my world of coffee is wide open again br br thanks for such a great product ! br br ted . 
life without bird 's custard has been hell ! i 've tried other varieties sthg from holland if i recall correctly just not up to snuff i ordered 6 to ensure i never run out ! better than ice cream and not half as fattening .

el gastroenterologo pediatra recomendo este tipo de leche para mis hijos , ya que las demas formulas lacteas le causaban una alergia que les hacia vomitar . 
i was in love from the moment i opened a bag and took the first whiff however , it did take me a while to figure out the right brewing method , because i found it was much easier to scald might be just me though first i boil the water , but whereas usually i just let it sit there for about a minute to cool , here i actually poured it into a pot and let it sit for about 2 or 3 minutes then i grind the beans medium coarse \( it smells heavenly \) and 2 tablespoons into the french press it goes pour the water in , and i let it sit for a bit longer than usual , too \( still hot though \) i find that it has a very nice sort of crunchy , hard caramelized sugar finish to it , kind of tastes like the top of a cr egrave me brulee delicious i drink it black . 
vendor shipped promptly and the product arrived in excellent condition this is an extremely well made product containing no grain fillers i had to purchase the entire case , not knowing if my feline diners would even like it it would have been nice if the vendor would allow sample purchases of select varieties rather than an entire case . 
as far as noodles in a cup goes this is one of the best i 've had actual recognizable small chunks of dehydrated veggies , mostly mushrooms and onions that i could make out descent noodle quality and a very hot and spicy seasoning mix they do n't show it on the picture here but i'm pretty sure this is the hot and spicy cup it looks exactly like the one i just had but the words 'hot and spicy' are just to the left of the symbol and are not visible in the pic if you like spicy noodles definitely do n't pass this up br br very good . 
revolution 's teas are superb smooth and delicate , each one has been pleasant , comforting and a pure delight i 've tried this one , the pomegranate , as well as ginger peach , dragon eye oolong , and white pear . 
i know nothing about this co2 method of decaffeinating but thought i would give this a try i usually buy the swiss water processed this had a wonderful chocolatey taste it also claimed to be 99 9 caffein free hopefully this is all true because it really is the best i have tried of decaf . 
i love this coffee great taste and great way to start your morning if you like flavored coffee you will like this . 
i bought this along with the easy freeze ice cube trays for my two dogs my vet put my lab on a diet so i have been looking for low calories treats to feed him for his evening snack each packet is only 30 calories and will fill one easy freeze ice cube tray \( six large ice cubes for the extra large size \) one packet will also fill my labs kongxl and my terriers kong medium they love it and make sure they lick their kong 's clean without getting bored with it overall a great snack ! . 
love this blend , so was delighted to find it on your subscribe save program \( at a better price br than w keurig so really disappointed to learn today it was no longer available on said program br shame on manufacturerer ! . 
despite what many say and think about bulldogs , ours are picky about their snacks they love the liver biscotti which can be a hand fed treat or used in a treat ball they last longer than most snacks and because our bullies do n't often chew their food , these are the perfect size i do n't feel bad about feeding these either because they are low calorie and without fillers . 
we are trying to curb our carbohydrates the wasa crisp'n light is a big help especially when you need something crisp we have and will continue to order this product thanks amazon for selling this tasty cracker .

very high quality food that my dog will actually eat always ships promptly and well packaged . 
i bought these for my husband because he occassionally likes a cup of coffee at home and it is a hassle to drag out the coffee maker and grinder when he only wants one cup and it 's not everyday it also comes in handy when guests come over , because we do n't tend to keep coffee in the house br br each serving comes in a little pouch that you can easily slip into your pocket , briefcase or travel bag the flavor was rich and at around 1 00 a cup , much cheaper than going to starbucks or anywhere else and grabbing a cup on the way to work br br it dissolves completely leaving no grit or residue he first tried it in a 12 ounce mug and found it to be a little strong , but was perfect in his 20 ounce travel mug br br . 
i love this coffee ! ! i had always mixed my decaf and regular to get 1 2 caffeine and now i can just buy it ! ! perfect amount for me i enjoy the flavor of coffee ! br br these vacuum sucked packages make it easy to store and use it keeps the coffee fresh ! ! i use then to refill another container and it works well for me ! ! . 
i also reviewed the jones soda berry pomegranate vitamin water and that one fell short because it was mostly water and sugar and cost over 1 per bottle br br the switch orange tangerine is much better in my opinion in terms of flavor it 's also carbonated up quite a bit and has added ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) which gives it a lot of tang bite for me it is n't unpleasant at all i like it br br contrary to other reviews , i do n't get the medicine aftertaste it 's just a good , refreshing , carbonated drink i tried this after getting in from a fairly warm bike ride and it does a pretty good job of quenching thirst i tried it straight from a room temperature can and over ice and both were great i like it over ice better , though then , just for fun , i added some malibu rum to see how it was as a mixer and it 's not bad i wo n't be asking for it at a bar , but it gets the fruity flavor with the coconut rum and i think if someone was creative , this could be a match made in heaven br br the down side \( to me \) is this is another fairly pricey drink the cans are n't full size cans either so for almost 1 per can you get a smallish 8 3 ounces but with regular sodas you get 12 ounces half again as much of course , sodas are n't 100 juice either br br upshot is if i'm on a beach somewhere and hot and thirsty , i 'd probably buy this for stocking at home , i 'll stick with regular frozen orange juice or orange juice in a carton i would recommend trying it for yourself , though this seems to be one of those drinks that could sway pretty hard depending on personal preferences . 
if you 're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips br this is a great deal and i have not had any problems with them going stale br the 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over eating . 
i have an interesting relationship with skittles when i was about 10 years old , i absolutely thought they were average at best and could n't understand what everyone loved so much about them too sour , not tasty enough was my impression later however , i entered my teenage years and it actually took until i nearly graduated from high school that the taste caught on with my tastebuds and became super delicious to me what also got me hooked is this kid i remember from 10th grade science class who would always bring in a bag of skittles every single day and chew on them , and all the girls liked him because of his good looks and smooth personality , so skittles sort of gave me the impression that cool kids eat skittles however , please buy bags of skittles from your local grocery store it 's not worth it here on amazon with the high dollar price you can find plenty of places in your area selling them for cheaper prices my only complaint with skittles is that , despite the color , they all taste exactly the same to me ! purple , green , red , orange , yellow i really ca n't taste a difference between these supposed different flavors then again , i do n't have a favorite color in a rainbow so maybe this makes perfect sense ! . 
some reviewers must have a short memory i 've been eating beer nuts since childhood and the ones i ordered tasted like they always have \( sweet and salty \) bought them locally until i could n't find them anymore great product and price for 6 12oz cans . 
i have fallen in love with this tea i am a british tea fanatic and ashby 's has superceded my tastes and expectations smooth , not to bitter , low tannins awesome taste ! i 'll take this over pg tips ! . 
honeyville rolled oats is a delicious product i am using them to make a product designed to increase and enrich the milk production in lactating mothers br the oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is i only paid 4 99 shipping for 50lbs of oats ! i encourage anyone who likes oats to order honeyville rolled oats their flavor is above all the rest . 
i am in love with this tea every other apple cinnamon tea i 've tried has been too cinnamon y this is the perfect blend it tastes like apple cider without all the sugar , which i love i recommend this tea to anyone who wants a low cal version of apple cider . 
the first time i tried this product was 2 years ago at the venetian spa restaurant in las vegas having a cup of tea with some friends we all remarked how delicious and tasty it made our tea we 've been using it ever since a little goes a long way and i use it anytime i would ordinarily use a sweetener since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and i have a sweet tooth , i felt this was a safe alternative not only is it safer , but there 's no aftertaste and does n't raise your blood sugar level this particular stevia has absolutely no bitter taste to it i 've tried others before and since and there 's no comparison . 
want to taste something different \? then you are coming to the right place i just love the smoothness and flavor of the ranch dressingnow get on your horses \( or mules \) and order some today . 
this is a really good product i had a little trouble the first couple times because i didnt tighten the lid down but besides that it is a good item . 
i bought this on a whim because i was craving strawberry shortcake wow ! the biscuits can be a bit crumbly , but the texture is not objectionable the taste was great ! i use this for sweet and regular biscuits br br we also use this for pancakes , and they are almost indistinguishable from regular pancakes i add vanilla , a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon for a treat yum ! br br tip i 've found that most gluten free bread products work better if you let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after mixing the dry and wet ingredients it seems to activate the batter , which makes the resulting stuff lighter and more moist . 
i love this tea ! both the green and white varieties are quite consistently fresh i have ordered this at least ten times from various internet sites i did n't realize how old and stale tea from the grocery store was until i had this brand for organic tea , it is quite reasonably priced they recommend using two tsp of loose tea per cup i use half that and it tastes great never , ever bitter ! very smooth tasting i highly recommend ! . 
to get a more intense taste , i mix two packets in a 16 oz bpa free camelbak bottle , adding 8 oz of water and the rest ice , plus a packet of stevia , shake well , sip , and oh so good ! no calorie sweet tea , green tea antioxidants , and i'm drinking a lot more water i also carry packets in my purse and add to water in restaurants , saving tons of money from ordering drinks and not to mention calories although the stash rep tells me there is a negligible amount of caffeine , the placebo effect gives me a great boost in the morning before my workout since i love mint , i think i 've found the perfect product . 
these are hands down the absolute best salt vinegar chips you can buy they have a great , strong flavor that has left me addicted these are certainly my favorite chips i highly recommend trying them ! . 
excellent product great taste and easy to sue in cereal , yougur etc that 's it in a nutshell very timely delivery . 
i brought a box with me to visit my daughter and family br we all enjoyedjthe fiber gourmet light penne very much . 
greenies arrived promptly , are fresh with an expire date thirteen months from now great price to keep my dogs favorite treat on hand for many months to come yes , she chewes through them quickly but she loves them so much , i dont care this is the best price i 've ever seen on greenies so we stocked up ! . 
i 've always given my dog what i thought was high quality dog food since she was a puppy after the pet food issues of a few years ago i switched to only organic dog food for her since she is only 10 lbs the price difference is n't too bad i am a free feeder which is n't ideal but means my dog basically has access to food any time she wants it because of this she only gets really excited when people food is offered to her well when i open this bag she comes over and eats asap good enough for me ! . 
this bisquick gluten free mix is amazing i have n't had a biscuit or banana bread in over a year and now i just ca n't stop making things br i just made banana bread \( for the 3rd time with this mix \) and my family loves it i use it for everything , i am so pleased i made a cherry pie , cheddar biscuits i 've been br using my old bisquick recipes from ages ago and it is working fine i am so thankful for amazon and their items i sure keep the ups guy br busy . 
i feed my dogs sojos as part of a mixed bowl of quality kibble and quality canned food i recommend sojos br br but i had a problem with the amazon purchase amazon stored the sojos bag in the original mailing box sojos sent them my order was picked from the shelf and the box containing the sojos was placed in another box and mailed to me the bag of sojos was almost one year old and there was no way amazon kept track of that i got a refund from amazon with no question and very quickly , but amazon needs to keep control of the use by dates of food they offer on their site . 
this is a great dog food product healthy , organic and great for sensitive tummies ! br br our lhasa apso is nine years old , is a picky eater and has a very sensitive stomach we started feeding him newman 's own organics dog food about 4 years ago and are really , really satified with this product he rarely gets sick , eats almost every meal we give him , though sometimes he makes us wait for him to finish his breakfast but that 's okay ! with other dog food products he would stop eating them completely or get sick frequently even the expensive brands we tried from the animal hospital br br at first the only place we could buy newman 's own was from a local , privately owned pet store which was very expensive but worth it since he stopped getting sick so frequently i was delighted to buy it on amazon the price for the 12 5 lb bag is slightly more than what we were paying for the 7 lb bag locally i am a prime member so was able to get this without paying for shipping i will certainly order it again when we get close to running out br br thank you amazon ! ! . 
terrific with english triffle beware though the pack of 6 each of the 6 containers makes about a gallon of pudding . 
for some reason amazon would not ship these to alaska ! so i sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them they are very good chips ! amazon should rethink the shipping to alaska thing i would order groceries online . 
i was skeptical at first , but not anymore , did it 's job and i slept like a baby great taste and product works wonders , very relaxing . 
i brought some of this back from a trip to jamaica and wished i had bought it by the gallon it is very hard to find but well worth ordering in bulk ! it is a sweet but spicy sauce that takes me back to jamaica with every taste i have attempted to duplicate it many times but ca n't seem to get it right i am ecstatic to finally have found a source . 
i agree with the company motto a natural obsession i tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent the flavor of these is very strong , so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor , like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread otherwise they compete or clash with the other food . 
if you have ever wondered what that delicious dipping sauce for the crab wontons are at pei wei , or the amazing sauce on chang 's chicken is , this is it ! br br i love this stuff i discovered it while at a pei wei someone had left a bottle of this laying out and i quick snapped a picture , took it to amazon and found it it is great on pretty much everything , as previous users say i was also in a thai restaurant the other night and they used the same sauce on an amazing salad try this on a do it yourself salad consisting of sliced mangos , lettuce , onions , and red peppers drench those ingredients in this stuff and everyone will think your a master chef . 
over 90 of dry dog food is very unhealthy and can not even get 1 or 2 stars out of 5 or 6 diamond naturals is a great food i have 6 afghans and i 've spent many , many hours of research to find this out . 
chilling in the fridge seems to boost the flavor even more and using them , rather than corn chips , to make nachos will have your tastebuds singing like janet jackson \( but without any of the associated wardrobe risks \( \) highly recommended . 
i'm not a coffee snob if i was , i doubt i 'd own a keurig i just want a decent tasting cup of coffee with little cleanup br br i 've tried many of the flavored coffees , but they 're too gimmicky for me starbucks brand tastes burnt to me , even their blonde roast in stores i mean , i have not tried the starbucks brand kcups br br i like this breakfast blend because it 's not too dark , not too light it tastes like what no frills coffee should taste like i order the biggest size to get the best value br br update i just tried to create a review for the jamaica me crazy coconut flavor , which i thought was terrible \( and i love coconut \) i should specify that the original review was for breakfast in bed . 
flavor 5 stars first time i used the oil i poured some in a saute pan to scramble some eggs it ended up being an earthy mushroom like flavor i loved it i pour it on my dogs food occasionally and they love it i wanted to buy this originally because i watched the dr oz tv show and he recommended ingesting a little every day for its anti inflammatory properties i gave some oil to my aunt who has an auto immune disease and she likes the oil as well i would definitely buy this product again br br ding for metal alloy container it is cheap metal and though it was packaged well by amazon com the containers probably got dented in amazon 's warehouse because it did n't seem like the packaging should have caused the dents the way it was packaged if there was any damage it would probably only be dents to the containers so i would say expect dents with any shipment of oils if this company uses the same cheaper kind of metal alloy for their containers dents do not make the product taste worse so i do not worry about the taste i will return it if the containers leak but that would not stop me from ordering again however , the odds of leaking happening probably statistically is not often if you receive shipments regularly . 
we do a lot of bicycle riding in the heat and longer rides as well we do n't want to crash from lack of carbs in our system other energy products do n't taste as good as these do they are conveniently packed in little pouches so they are easy to grab and take along when we ride good stuff ! . 
we are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergy br they taste fine for our family we like them many ways ! . 
so , i moved from europe to the us , i settled in my apartment etc , and after a week or so i decided that i wanted some candy i went to the supermarket and started looking for some m m 's then this weird red bag caught my eye and i thought , hah ! , this country is funny , they put an 's' instead of an 'm' on their m m 's here , and the bag is all different too br br so i took one bag home to try it i grabbed a handful of the presumed m m 's and what a surprise this was obviously not what i had bargained for , and i considered ditching this wrong purchase , but instead i figured i 'd give this weird stuff another chance at some other time br br do you realize that my mortal soul could still have been saved , at that point \? \? br br it was only in the next few days that the addiction set in i found myself longing for more of that flavor when the bag was through i would n't have reckoned at first , that i would actually buy many more of these bags on purpose br br now my willpower has been eternally challenged my stomach will never be like before my jaw is numb from the endless compulsive chewing and i can just feel my teeth desintegrating right when i take another dose why do i forever ache for that soothing acidic taste \? they 're so delicious they ought to be outlawed ! . 
fresh scent and taste easy to eat one tin in few hours i use them as favors and everyone loved them . 
i love that it is mainstream and that it works like bisquick not all recipes work the same as regular bisquick though so i wish they had more recipes available it does taste more gluten free than some other options out there . 
i received this chips in a gift basket and absolutely loved them i searched high and low , but was unable to find them until i saw them here i immediately ordered a case these chips are light , crispy , flavorful , and good for you i love them with dip , in chili , or just plain once you try them , you 'll be hooked ! . 
i did not purchase this product off of amazon i purchased the 12 oz bottle at a local store , and i must say it 's one of the most addicting sauces i have ever had ! i'm a pretty picky eater , and a vegetarian at that , so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one this sauce is almost perfect it 's very sweet , and has a strong garlic taste at first it is n't as thick as the red hot brand , which i did n't like much at all \( thick , not as flavorful , way too chunky \) this sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not my son loves spicy food just like his mommy another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons , and that much sauce goes a long way 1 gram of fiber , too ! the only thing i have a hard time with , and this is just a personal issue , is the texture of the red chilli they tastes great , but they have a very thin , clear skin that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces not all , just some i get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy still , i eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces i have ever tasted ! i would recommend anyone to try this sauce first , and then try others if you are not fully satisfied this sauce is amazing it was about 1 50 at the store for 12 oz but if you like the easiness of ordering online or ca n't find it near you , know that i would pay amazon 's price for it any day ! buy this sauce i do n't care where or how , just buy it you 'll fall in love ! . 
i really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here unlike some of the mass production pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring , tasselfield 's pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference you can even taste the fibers from pineapple br br i opted for the traditional pineapple this time i will be interested in trying out the longan or mango variety next time . 
i like the smoked sweet paprika better than other styles of sweet paprika it came fresh at a reasonable price . 
we recently adopted a new kitten we rotate felidae grain free canned formula with wellness turkey canned food he loves both and eats well , he 's never left a single whole pea behind this is a very high quality cat food , using excellent all meat proteins he is healthy , active , affectionate , and has a smooth glossy coat definitely worth the cost in the long run br br i believe it is worthwhile to rotate different \( high quality \) canned foods for variety and to not create a cat who will only eat one brand i think this is useful also in the event of a recall i'm looking for a 3rd high quality brand to add to the rotation . 
this one will not disappoint ! i got this yesterday and my husband and i tried it this morning with breakfast and we both loved it i have gotten many different kinds of the k cups to try but after trying this one , i think i could be happy with just this one and black tiger for those mornings when i want a really strong cup of coffee the rodeo drive blend is delicious with a nice round feel on the palate and an interesting flavor on the finish with just a hint of smokiness perfectly balanced and absolutely wonderful ! plus , i have to admit i love the label the different color looks very appealing on my carousel with the other k cups . 
this is an excellent product for the non gluten diet they 're good alone as a snack , or you can make a light meal with them by using these rice crackers as a base for spreads or little crispy sandwiches excellent substitute for crackers containing gluten only criticism wish the price would come down . 
at my house , we call it hot vanilla this is the best hot chocolate type drink i 've ever tasted i am a lifelong chocoholic , but now i order stephen 's french vanilla by the case because all the others pale in comparison , and i just do n't want them anymore you wo n't regret springing for a case of it makes a terrific gift too mmmmmmm . 
i do n't drink a lot of flavored k cups , but people have been raving about wolfgang puck 's k cups , so i gave this a try it 's definitely a good quality flavored coffee with a medium body overall , i have enjoyed several cups of this and have temporarily shelved my timothy flavored k cups in favor of this one i sometimes add sugar free vanilla syrup , cream , and cinnamon it 's excellent that was in place of dessert i also tried caramel syrup added to this do n't do it it overwhelms the flavor . 
i bought this baking soda to clean my teeth 3 times a week they say that teeth become noticeably whiter br but you 've to to be very gentle while brushing and use soft type tooth brush i did notice a difference br br also , i noticed that when baking soda was mixed with water , the ph indicator showed the highest level \( almost 8 5 9 on the chart \) br this may explain why baking soda is so effective to fight germs br br it 's a good product . 
purchased original can at walmart of course , during the holidays it was n't always there i got on amazon com and found a really good deal on it my family i loved it thru the holidays and will be taking a canister of it with us when we go camping and using it year round good good product taste ! . 
my 8 year old son has numerous allergies plus autism and these cookie bars are a life saver ! they 're made with fruit juice as opposed to cane sugar , so i do n't feel bad about giving them to him we 've tried many gluten free cookies , these are by far his favorites ! unfortunately the local stores do n't keep them well stocked , so i'm glad i found them here if you 're not used to gluten free products , you probably wo n't like them the texture is very different than wheat , but if you have n't had wheat in quite a while , these are very tasty and not as crumbly as other gluten free products they are fabulous cookies and i'm so glad nana 's makes them do n't ever stop ! . 
this stuff is pretty solid makes a decent enough pancake for being gf and makes a solid biscuit as well what we have found works best is taking this mix and using it half and half with the chebe mix between the two it makes for a very nice flour mix the chebe is good but on its own tends to be a little squishy , but when you mix it with the bisquick , the bit of squishiness gives the dryer bisquick the fluffiness and moistness it needs so , i recommend this , but i would highly recommend getting some chebe too and cutting the bisquick with it also , even though this mix has leavening agents in it , when we use recipes that call for leavening agents we add them anyway , it tends to turn out better this way . 
we are typical americans who know we should eat better , but often do n't because health food is usually expensive and frankly does n't taste that good that is why we are so thankful to have found mrs may 's products ! ! they are all very healthy and quite tasty , and ordering them from amazon keeps the cost down my son 's a golfer , and i am always looking for portable , healthy snacks for him to tuck in his golf bag mrs may 's products fit the bill nicely . 
milder than most vinegars , but with its own very special taste to add to ume plum vinegar , and cider vinegar for that hmmmmm layer of flavor ! . 
plugged direct into windows and controlled via ustream tv software interface this worked well , \( although we needed a little more gain obtainable by using better software cubase , garage band etc \) , as an interim setup before we could get a more pro level interface for more than one mic etc nice ! br it feels a bit flimsy construction wise but we were not going to take it on the road ! . 
i am on my second can , i ordered the case of 6 and i keep it hidden from the grandkids i never thought you could have good tasting dark hot chocolate i just heat a cup of water in the microwave for 80 seconds and add the chocolate it dissolves completely with stirring . 
i only used one green with it 's ball , etc with the golfer on the cake i made one long hole with fairway , sand traps , water hazards and green my hubby loved it for his big 30th golf themed party i used the extra golf clubs , balls and pins on the decor table around the cake if i had a huge sheet cake to decorate i could see using the three greens but it would n't have fit right on one 9x13 cake knowing i was buying wilton made me confidant that i would be very satisfied and i was and for the price , i could n't go wrong \) . 
i was reading the other day about which items you shoud buy organic br and fruits and vegtables were the top of the list so dahh it dawns br on me what have i been feeding my baby \? we changed to earths best br i feel better , feeding the best br also we use earths best formula when we changed our baby now sleeps br thru the night and that realy makes me happy ! . 
baking for my husband \( with type 2 diabetes \) just go easier br i can adapt regular receipes i use only half the amount of sugar called for a bam ! they turn out great the 4 pack is a great buy too ! . 
i found this exact same stuff at the dollar store it is pretty good not as good or as strong as my loose whole leaf tea , but for the price it ca n't be beat bags are never as good as loose leaf i use it if i want one quick cup i steep my loose leaf tea 2 3 times , so i have to have time to drink 2 3 cups i gave this 4 stars because it is a good deal for the money purchased from the dollar store if i make myself a mug , and because it is cheap , i use 2 bags i would have been disappointed if i had paid the original price on here for it though . 
i finally finished my box of the blueberry green tea powder and wanted to try something new ! so glad i tried this flavor as it is now my favorite ! just add it to a cold bottle of water , drink it as is , or add a few drops of stevia or agave and you are good to go very refreshing ! ! will be packing this on my trip to mexico ! . 
these have become a wonderful alternative to those afternoon cravings for salt , and or sugar they have texture and flavor , and a bag hits the spot i would highly recommend these if you are looking for an alternative to the junk from candy machines . 
no more dry kibble for our felines ! ! ! after a few medical emergencies and educating myself why cats are not designed by mother nature to eat dry kibble \( any brand \) , i changed our clan of felines to healthy wet food br every cat with a blocked urinary tract is fine , until they start to strain to urinate and have to be rushed to the er br with all the issues of recalls and such concerning the pet food industry , we rotate 3 different brands of food felidae is one it has no grains , soy , corn , or icky fillers felidae is a pate loaf like consistency br since changing to a wet food only diet , none of our cats have been back to er in years none throw up no runny eyes coats are shiny no matted hair all are at a perfect weight the changes are amazing br having 5 cats , i am very thankful for the 13 oz size cans of felidae br i had a question recently and sent felidae an email they answered very promptly and were very kind their customer service deserves 5 stars also . 
my husband and i found this rub in a little market in philly a few years ago we have since purchased it religiously since it adds great flavor to steaks that now ca n't eat a steak without it it is definitely a must try ! . 
for years , i 've been completely devoted to dunkin donuts brewed at the store and at home i tried brewing dd in my k cup and i also bought the eco brew and the actual dd k cups awful ! so i was searching high and low for a new coffee after trying all the decaf k cups on the market , i finally found and loved wolfgang puck decaf coffee k cups this is the only place i can find them so i hope amazon never stops selling them here they are mellow , medium roast and i enjoy them every day any other brand is just a back up try them i have never had any trouble with any of the cups and i'm on my third order now of 48 cups if they had a problem , they 've fixed it br br this is an update being done on july 7 , 2012 i continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee every day it has ruined me for other coffees as i measure every other cup against this incredible wolfgang puck decaf k cup please , please , please amazon , make this part of your subscription service my head hurts trying to make sure that i always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee . 
i use this syrup in tea , coffee and over cut up fruit and ice cream i buy unflavored creamer and add this to it much cheaper alternative to pre flavored coffee creamer . 
my dog is simply crazy about these treats but what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi long lasting morsel of enjoyment in additon to that , since these treats are all natural , they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats , making them extra healthy br br the price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you ca n't beat the quality . 
after purchasing these steaks for myself i found then to be so easy to store and very tasty when bbq 'd i decided to share them with my family and friends as gifts , they just loved them . 
i am a coffee lover it is one of the few pleasures of my life so i was excited to review this product once received i opened it up and gave a good sniff i know to some that may sound stupid , but i love to open coffee and have the aroma surround me , this coffee did not do that as much as others that i have used i had to really give a good sniff to smell the aroma , but it smelled pretty good once i got my nose in there br br i set out to brew myself a pot i followed the directions and enlisted my husband to have a cup with me now usually i do not drink decaffeinated , so i was just a little concerned decaf to me can taste very flat but i waited and a nice smell filled the air finally our coffee was ready and we both sat down to taste this product my husband smiled he loves any coffee that has arabica beans he looked at me and said , ummm this is really good my turn i sniffed some more , i'm a real sniffer before anything goes into my body it still smelled pretty good so now for the taste test br br okay , it was definitely different than the dunkin donuts coffee that i'm use to and love however , it had a smooth flavor , but a little richer than i like and i did n't seem to notice that it was decaf , that was a good thing it was flavorful and made a pretty good cup of coffee hubby liked it a lot so i would have to say it was a winner , a good rich coffee flavor and a good price . 
i just love these have tried several flavors gives a gluten freer a chance to snack on a crunchy , healthy snack ! ! . 
this creme brulee is better than some of the better french restaurants i 've been to i just wish my local grocery stores would carry it ! . 
bought these for my daughter 's grad party as well as the strawberry she loves these things they 're a great product . 
this may not be the best tasting thing i have ever drank but man do i feel instant results after drinking some i would best describe the effects as very close to the good feeling you experience when you drink coffee i notice that my circulation feels fantastic like my whole body is warm , a very healthy dose of energy and i dont notice any jitteryness like coffee or energy drinks give you the only reason i didnt rate it 5 start is because a 16oz bottle is 3 00 which i think is a little steep but for the great feeling i get when i drink some i would highly recommend it to anyone else who wants to feel a boost of energy as well as a general sense of well being . 
i'm no coffee snob but this is still much better than crap you get a starbucks \( i drink black coffee so flavor really matters when its not covered by caramel and other junk \) great coffee for a great price , especially if you get it when amazon is offering the 3 off coupon . 
i would recommend this tea , it has a fresh taste with an amazing acai grape flavor that i have not had before it also gave me energy which i can always use ! . 
i'm a crunchaholic ! i have to have something during the day to crunch ! all other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on popchips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too ! i highly recommend them all , but the salt and pepper are my least favorite ! . 
i bought this as a gift he liked it very much br it came in good condition and good time br i rate it aaaa . 
the first moment you bite into this cracker , you will notice the difference this tasty , crunchy , organic cracker is perfect with soup or salad it is certified organic , using quality ingredients the cracker is dry , not greasy or oily like a typical potato chip br br comes in several different varieties and flavors br br recommended . 
so i have sampled and bought my fair share of everidae sauce and i have to say without a doubt it is the next best thing to put on food i will start off by saying i do know the maker of this sauce , and although that may seem like this review is a bit biased , i wanted to be the first to formally state the flavorful blend of this sauce can literally go on everything br br i like spicy hotness , and unlike other condiments like franks red hot , this does n't mask the flavor of the food but adds to it br i have used this sauce on hotdogs , hamburgers , chicken , tacos , and eggs br br the mild is a little bit sweeter than the medium and hot \( the hot being the heat that i particularly enjoy \) but this stuff can be added to almost any sauce or family recipe to give it that extra kick of spicy sweetness that will make your mouth water . 
as a new keurig owner , i'm trying as many sampler packs as possible to determine what both my husband and i like the most br br although quite pricey and not coming in the cute gift box some other crazy cups purchases have been received in , i am enjoying this variety thoroughly it is almost entirely iced drinks and this sampler pack had a good mix of the following br br southern sweet tea , unsweetened black tea , raspberry sweet tea , peach sweet tea , sweet lemon tea , half half tea and a few different iced coffee k cups additionally , there were a few seasonal island coconut which my husband loves br br i would consider purchasing variety packs as my main source of k cups , but at a price of over 90 cents a cup i ca n't justify the cost however , this is a good starting point to narrow down some favorites to purchase in single flavor boxes ! br br if these were presented in the gift boxes they use for other samplers , this would be a very ideal gift house warming present for these hot summer months ! i do n't mind them not being in a gift box , but i could have at least used that as an excuse to myself for the price . 
my dogs love these ! ! when i ran out of them recently , they were counter sniffing trying to find some i have a service dog that has to maintain his weight , and these are perfect for him . 
this is a nice , refreshing carbonated drink it has no added sugar , as advertised but its name is a bit misleading the orange tangerine also has some apple and grape juice added the grape is not a great addition to the blend , so i was n't thrilled with the flavor . 
this is an excellent tea one of the best i have ever had it is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar . 
great for a snack \( i eat a 2500 calorie day diet \) i eat this between lunch and work and it hits the spot an entire bowl is 400 calories arrived on time and its easier and cheaper than buying in bulk at acme or other such \( not costco but i dont have my own member card \) . 
i was a little skeptical on ordering the teriyaki sticks version based on a couple of reviews but , i am happy i did they were a soft stick as someone said but had a nice crunch when you bit in the teriyaki was milder than others i have ordered and they were more smokey but they are called ole' smokeys i did not get the greasy mouth feel that someone said and it did have a pleasant tasting after taste all in all , worth a 4 rating but it could be a 5 based on individual tastes . 
i received all the ingredients in a timely manner all the ingredients were nicely packed and remained fresh through the shipping stages it was more than i needed for the meal i was making , so i had plenty of left over ingredients . 
i am in no way any coffee expert , connoisseur , or heavy user to be perfectly honest , i had to look up how to spell connoisseur ! but having a heart attack 6 months ago , i am learning to never use caffeine , salt , or almost any darn thing i love and i hate anything that is light , decaf or artificially sweetened my wife has bought about every single brand of instant decaf coffee for me along with assorted real decaf to try in her drip coffee maker hated em all , just hated them saw this so thought i would try the latest brand i would hate since it would n't cost me anything br br first batch was way to bitter for me , did n't even want to try any more but my wife said she would make it weaker from that next batch on , i became hooked on this brand i do n't like the price , but love the taste that conflict alone makes me drop my rating to give it a 4 star overall if i tinker with taste as i also add assorted coffee mate creamers \( also something i am not allowed anymore but refuse to give up \) , the taste goes to a 5 for me even with all the discounts if i order through the subscribe save program \( see below \) , i find this a bit pricey br br br br update december 4 2010 br it still pains me to pay so much but looks like this will be the very 1st vine program item i ever got that will make an actual buyer out of me as a result , i raise my review from 4 stars to 5 starts another thing i like is i have no decaf aftertaste that i always experience with other brands it is a wonderful thing to find at least one new thing \( for me anyway \) that i can still really enjoy , that helps me relax in the middle of all this ca n't eat this , ca n't drink that stuff going on in my life the past 6 months it 's also the time i have n't felt like i was compromising good taste for good health for that , i am truly grateful just ordered the 3 pack on the amazon subscribe save page . 
my subscription of popchips arrived on time and not damaged i love the fact that i receive a great variety of chips which are healthier and at the same time very tasty and satisfying the way the chips are packed for shipping is perfect ! having a subscription is the way to go and of course the price is so right ! ! ! br br thank you , . 
i am not a huge coconut fan , so i was n't excited about trying this , but with one sip it definitely won me over ! the flavor is perfect and is now one of the flavors in our regular rotation and it smells so good ! ! ! . 
i picked up a 3 oz bag of the salt and vinegar chips last weekend at wegman 's and in a blink of an eye , the bag was gone very nice vinegar flavor bad side was in a blink of an eye they were gone which is not good for portion control i ordered the variety pack in 8 oz size \( single serving \) to help with portion control most of the flavors i like but fair warning , the parmesan garlic is very garlic love the salt and pepper with 100 calories a pack , what a nice change from baked chips try it you will like it . 
good product almost all the popcorn pops up fluffy and snow white with our air popper , great snack with few calories taste great ! . 
i discovered pop chips a year or so ago , and my whole family loves them ! we are partial to crunchy , salty snacks \( like potato chips \) but hardly ever get them because of the calorie overload these are a perfect substitute ! great to tide you over between meals , or with a sandwich , or a movie watching snack the small size bags are perfect for not getting too carried away , too ! . 
i found these tubs at costco and was dismayed to discover that they are no longer carrying them i buy the 4 pack here at amazon and i am very satisfied the snacks are tasty not too salty and offers a variety of chips in the mix that all blend nicely . 
excellent for gf not bad on it 's own but i have used it as a basis for coconut cake , pineapple upside down cake , tres leches cake and others . 
i love little white kernels of popped corn this was good stuff , but i think i 'll try a larger white kernel to pop next time , my preference . 
my 3 5 yr old daughter with autism loves these ! she is on a special gluten free , casein free and soy free diet and these are a wonderful snack for her . 
dude , these things are pretty good as long as you 're not bent on them being just like oreos i mean , they 're not but i definitely like them better than other chocolate cracker snacks like teddy grahams the lightness of the crackers makes them perfect for slathering on other goodies , like peanut butter , cream cheese , icing , pudding , melted chocolate . 
a friend referred me to these and told me that they were freaking awesome i decided to give them ago and surprisingly they work extremely well i found that the taste of them , while they are dissolving on your tongue is a bit horrid , but nothing i could n't tolerate br br after it dissolved me and some friends decided to test it we cut up some lemons and limes and decided to see if these really worked and to our amazement they really did the lemons tasted like a 'lemon drop' candy , and the limes were very refreshing we then expanded our horizons and started trying other things to see what it was like we found some other foods to be excellent , and others not so much all in all it 's very fun br br they are , however , quite expensive the effects on me lasted roughly 1 1 5 hours so as a novelty , hurray for these . 
this coffee reminds me of dunkin donuts coffee , which is all the rage now i like both dd and yuban about equally , but i opt for yuban because of the price this is really great coffee at a reasonable price it 's a light roast if you 've never tried yuban , maybe try one can before committing to the 12 pack if you 've tried it and like it , then you know this is a good deal . 
this is one of the best hot dogs made , unfortunatally it is not widely available citymade must be off their rocker if they think people are gonna sale hot dogs for such a crazy price granted there is 30 weiners in a package , still a stupid price . 
great low cal snack satisfies the crunchy , snacky , salty cravings without high calories all flavors are good the cheddar is a little too seasoned for my taste . 
these are so good , my next order will be on the monthly schedule br very easy to make and super delicious we used milk and chipped br ice , along with the mix i might try water one time to see how br that is i wish i could rate this product higher than 5 stars . 
these grove square hot cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the keurig we took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good br br dark chocolate my favorite , very good even on the large cup setting br milk chocolate excellent on the small cup and good on the large cup setting br peppermint everyone likes this one , on either cup size setting br br these do contain sucralose in addition to sugar , i do n't notice the taste but my wife does \( but she still likes them \) br br highly recommended ! br br cfh . 
i 've tried a variety of ahmad tea not because i particularly like this brand , but they are just easier to come across the imperial blend , i believe , is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones i 've tried it 's full body like a good cup of assam , which by no means overpower the delightful , clean taste of darjeerling , complete with a long lasting note of bergamot i enjoy it best in the evening it gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day br br for those interested in the specifics i use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug , let it steep in 208f water for 2 3 min , take the infuser out , and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication . 
empty k cups , miniature filters and lids allow you to use your own favorite ground coffee if you buy roasted beans and grind your own , this is the solution for you one scoop in the k cup , put on the lid and pop it into your kuerig br br i shied away from buying a kuerig because i love my kenya aa from talk 'n coffee in deptford , nj they roast it dark , grind it almost to percolator coarseness for me \( sigh \) and ship it to me here in florida i had tried mesh filters but even with my custom percolator grind , i 'd get grinds in the brew the special cup holders looked like a labor intensive solution too so i stuck with my mr coffee when i saw the disposable cups on amazon , i ordered them along with the keurig br br this works great ! a single fresh hot cup of kenyaa aa dark roast whenever the spirit moves me and no worries about having to make a partial pot for only one cup i 'll have talk 'n coffee grind the beans a little finer for the kuerig on my next order i re ground my percolator grind a little finer and the portion strength is now perfect for the travel mug size br br kathy buys loose tea and uses the disposable k cup for a mug whenever it suits her fancy it 's a lot easier than the little metal thingie with the chain and waiting for a kettle to boil br br one benefit i had n't counted on is that clean up is easy and fast pluck the used disposable k cup from the kuerig and toss it in the trash no more having to service the coffee pot ! br br to save time in the morning , i used to set up mr coffee the night before but now i just make up the disposable k cups a dozen at a time and we fresh brew by the cup in the morning for several days running we actually use less coffee after evaporation and who does n't want the last cup considerations i think the savings on coffee and mr coffee filters is probably break even with the cost of the disposable k cups so net net , they seem free br br only one con from me it 's hard for these arthritic old hands to fit the lid on due to the filter overlapping the top of the k cup folding or cutting away the overlap causes grinds in the brew and a clogged lower needle i do n't think there is a cure without the downside being greater than the problem i have found patience and not over loading the k cup to be the best solution . 
we love this coffee it is the best k cup we 've found we like strong coffee and struggled at first to find one that we enjoyed the prices on amazon ca n't be beat and the shipping super fast . 
splenda contains real sugar , you have to pay attention to the word 'blend' in the title yes , diabetics can eat it because it 's only half \( or less \) the blood sugar elevating agent of the same volume of 'real' sugar it 's also why it tastes like 'real' sugar and can be cooked unlike some sugar sustitutes a lot of non sucrose based sweetners are destroyed by heat br br what i 've found with this splenda brown sugar is , even though it 's bulked up so that it 's supposed to be equivalent in volume to all sucrose , it 's really very , very sweet so i do not substitute it 1 1 for sugar i use much less than i would real sugar . 
reasonable in price , tastes good prefect for keurig , which can be pricey we will probably buy this again it is mostly for the kiddos anyway ! . 
taste great , once in awhile you will come across a pocket of fat but its worth the risk anything from this supplier is good quality and value . 
not sure it should be legal we put this and a few other spices i wo n't share here on some lamb chops and just fried them they were amazing this spice tastes pretty hot by itself , which makes it a bit hard to figure out how a blend with it and other spices is going to turn out the end result , strangely , was not hot at all since i like spicy , i would usually have been disappointed , but this was so good , i did not even care seriously you have to try this i ordered two other spices at the same time , neither of which will be getting a good review . 
i 've tried many gluten free products on the market and this is by far the easiest and more yummiest product yet ! ! thank you betty crocker ! ! ! . 
they melt in your mouth ! i think i found my perfect snack br i love oreos , but hate all the fat they provide to my diet by diet i mean the ability to eat everything in moderation i monitor how much fat i ingest for many reasons , health being the most important one package of these cookies had the same great taste of oreos with only 1 4 of the fat br i also like the fact that they come in individual packages they do n't go stale you can take them on trips , movies , park , etc br great tea or coffee cookies too ! and , of course , good old milk . 
these cups are great i have been reusing the originals and putting aluminum foil for the top these make it much easier and you can reuse them also . 
i know the product title says molecular gastronomy , but do n't let that scare you off i have been looking for this for a while now , not for food science , but for something more down to earth i use it to make my own coffee creamer br br i have to have my coffee blonde and sweet but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat , and honestly , i hate to use manufactured food items i really do n't think they are good for the body on the other hand , i hate using cold milk or cream , because i like hot coffee br br i stumbled across this on amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer i also bought low fat \( non instant \) milk powder and regular milk powder the non instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low fat milk , but does not dissolve good in cold water which is not a problem for hot coffee you will have to play with the ratios i would not do just the heavy cream , it made the coffee too rich also , i think the powder is too expensive to just use on it 's own i like mixing 1 3 of each together br br for flavoring , i bough cocoa bean powder , vanilla bean powder , and caster \( superfine \) sugar i mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers if you wanted , you could use a fake sweetner powder instead i make up small amounts that i store in jelly canning jars i also use my little food chopper food processor to blend everything , so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom let it settle for a bit before opening the top though br br this stuff tastes way better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolate orange mix br br all of the ingredients i mentioned are here online take the time to experiment maybe you do n't use any low fat milk or do n't add any flavorings it is up to you also , would make great housewarming host \( ess \) gifts br br i am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it , and i am sure i will experiment with it in cooking but the main reason i bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great . 
i have met the creator inventor of the jelly belly and i can report with full confidence , that this is one tasty licorice jelly bean a jelly belly is smaller than jelly beans and that is why ronald reagan liked them so much my personal favorite flavor is licorice 5 stars ! . 
we love to get masaman curry at our local thai restaurant , but i have n't been able to find a paste that actually tastes like it this paste does , and is very easy to prepare just add some coconut milk and heat add your protein and veggies of choice , done ! i have now bought some of the other mae ploy products , and found them all very good quality with authentic flavors . 
i have had my herb savor for a few weeks now , and i was waiting to write a review until my herbs went bad , so i could tell you how long it takes , but it never happened for the first time ever , i used all of the herbs before they went bad i have not had any problems with leaking everything closes up nice and tight on mine plus , this thing just looks really cool ! . 
found these at a local grocery store and just about fell in love with them their taste is fresher and most of the seeds live up to their name i got original , ranch and sizzlin bacon they 're all great ! when my grocery store told me they got bigs as a one time deal , i was happy to find them at amazon if you 're a seeder you 've gotta try these . 
like me , you can still enjoy the delicate beauty of bonsai carefully preserved , these are real bonsai preserved in suspended animation they need no feeding , pruning , watering or plant care , merely cosmetic care for those of us who do n't have the time , patience or skill to cultivate plants , these make a nice surrogate , and they make nice gifts , too preserved bonsai can reach into the hundreds of dollars this one is double trunked , reasonably priced , and very attractive . 
i like full bodied coffee and to try something different to supplement the standard one i use this coffee was perfect for that purpose timothy 's rainforest expresso is still my standard one but i will order this again . 
i bought this from safeway for about 5 it 's awesome in making those homemade iced caramel macchiatos that cost 4 at starbucks ! \) br br \( i do n't know if it 's just me , but it has this slight chocolatey aftertaste to it that 's just absolutely divine \) . 
the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for 1 dissapointing ! . 
i do a lot of from scratch gluten free cooking but there is nothing that can replace bisquick from the ease of morning pancakes to using it in other reciepes in place of other mixes there is simply nothing that i cannot do with this little box . 
tried this for the first time last night and really liked it , it had a great taste good for when you want something but do not want to ruin your diet bought them in the grocer for 7 99 i thought that was expensive hopefully i can find them cheaper elsewhere . 
i liked it ! br br did n't know what to expect it has a variety of fruit juices such as apple , orange and grape , but clearly had a strong orange taste i liked the fact there was no added sweeteners such as hfc or sugar i'm not a pop soda drinker , but i think if i served this instead of the traditional orange stuff in a 2 liter people would n't notice the difference br br it 's a bit pricy for orange soda and i'm sure orange juice would be better , but if you are looking for something healthier , this one 's for you . 
i have a bag of this coffee shipped to me every other month i do notice the flavor can vary over time with that said , the worse i 've had was just plain great , and the best roasts are to die for i 've noticed this variation with other coffees too i always assumed it was the minute differences in roasting , and of course the bean itself being a plant , it will hardly have the exact same characteristics of another plant perhaps weather variations count too this last year , the flavor and taste has been more consistent than it was a few years back everyone has different tastes but speaking for myself , this is as close to perfect as it gets . 
based on other reviews , i tried these kavli products they 're great low fat snacks these are great with natural peanut butter and jelly between 2 br br recommended . 
this is pretty good canned meat the sausage i used in dirty rice , the hamburger i used for taco salad , the chicken with wild rice , and the pork with stuffing the turkey i gave to a neighbor because i do n't eat it the various meats are all pretty good quality and was enough for 3 large portions each can there were n't large chunks of fat or gristle in any of the cans , which i 've experienced plenty with some brands of canned meats the proportion of liquids to meat was fair too , it 's not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either , though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat none of the meat was seasoned , at all this is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring there is a mild spam like texture and taste to the meats \( but way better than spam any day \) , almost a brine or something , that 's why i heavily seasoned it do n't plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats , it gave everything a slightly rancid , soury taste no idea why ! due to the higher calories and higher price , i will only stock this as emergency food i will buy more for that reason . 
complete , protein based nutrition my dogs love this although i'm not sure the pibble actually tastes it , she inhales it so fast \) br br regarding the other users who have had diarrhea issues my gastro picky gsd \( is that a word \? i think other gsd owners will understand ! \) has had this as well initially , i overfed this food , thinking that he needed to be eating the same amount as he had been eating the other stuff br you feed much less of this product it is nutrient dense , and not all filler like other foods if you over feed , you increase the risk of unpleasant side effects br br it 's a bit pricey , and i have n't broken down the cost per day , but since you feed less it might be competitive with other brands if someone was inclined to run the numbers . 
i had a difficult time trying to find aluminum free baking soda and finally found it on amazon it was shipped quickly and the seller put in several free samples of natural beverage mixes \( which i really appreciated and will use \) very pleased with this product . 
i just ordered this , came today and thought i would just try it , well to my amazement , my little daisy ate it and wanted more my little dog is just 8 yrs but has trouble with flare ups with her pancreas , i have to avoid fats and corn with her and she needs more fiber i have been making her dog food , but she missed eating the dry , i wondered if it was small enough for her to chew , but it was . 
the recommendation when we bought our puppies \( lhasa bichon mix and lhasa poodle mix \) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned this is a somewhat expensive food so i ca n't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home br br let me just say this , i have had small dogs before never have i seen such gas issues both of them consistently had foul gas consistently usually when they 're sitting on our laps but , you know they 're dogs br br when we got through the first bag of this stuff , we purchased more on amazon it was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of \( i think \) a 15 lb bag at petco but , they continued to have gas i mean , they loved the food , do n't get me wrong and they loved it more when we 'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food somehow that made their gas worse but i think i 'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down ca n't blame the food itself for gluttony br br eventually , we switched their food no more farting i think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies they just need that in their diet i think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful \( they said up until 1 year \) yeah right , you try dealing with gas for that long around 6 mos of age we switched to puppychow much better granted , they do n't like it as much , but we humans like it a whole lot better . 
this stuff is terrific ! it 's been at least 20 years since i have seen damson plum , jelly or jam , in stores in my area the taste of amish made damson plum jam was just as i remember it has a smooth texture and is sweet without being too sweet i will order this brand again . 
i was very pleased with my recent vanilla bean purchase from spice world when i opened the box , and not even unsealed the beans themselves , i could smell the fragrance of the bean , and see that they were in very good condition the have been very moist , easy to work with , and taste wonderful i ca n't recommend these people too much , and to say i was completely satisfied would n't do them justice i like finding a place i can shop from that will meet my demands for taste and quality i have a new home ! . 
i tried the cookies and they were great nd trying to find them in the stores br with no success did not realize they were seasonal or would have stocked up br great product . 
what a fresh smell and a very pleasant taste br it , s very good for you too i use it in place of olive oil , for salads and cooking . 
this product is positively wonderful ! use it anywhere you might use ordinary balsamic , but use it sparingly as it packs a very fruity punch apply just a bit to some fresh berries and pour it over vanilla ice cream for a fantastic desert treat . 
this product worked exactly as advertised i filled several cups in advance with my own coffee and was able to use them in my machine just like a k cup prior to purchasing , i read a review stating that the lid came off when the user was attempting to remove it from the machine this was not the case for me the lid was secure and it functioned just like the more expensive prefilled k cup i will order these disposakups regularly . 
i was skeptical because i 've seen mixed reviews on similar products like this but i'm glad i jumped in and decided to purchase it first of all the shipping was fast and it comes gift wrapped free which is cool second , the glass works great which is most important its double walled so when i poured my boiling hot water in the glass i had no problem carrying it from the kitchen to my bedroom and barely feeling any warmth the filter strainer does exactly what its supposed to do which is keep the loose tea out of your mouth while you drink your tea this is the first time i 've used something like this and it works perfectly for me br br the blooming tea comes in three small containers i'm new to tea so i ca n't tell what kind it is most likely some type of jasmine green tea because it smells good the first steeping is very mild but the second one the flavor really comes out anyway i hope this helps people that are on the fence like i was about buying glasses like this this package is legit and well worth the price . 
one of my top favorites , it 's infused with coconut and has a very unique flavor this coffee is best enjoyed without cream or sugar , and it will ether become one of your favorites or you 'll never buy it again some of my other favorites are vanilla biscotti , butter toffee , hawaiian hazelnut , and donut shop . 
she 's not a particularly food driven dog , so i 've tried lots of organic natural foods one that she consistently loves is any kind of addiction 's raw dehydrated food she can barely contain herself while it rehydrates a bit so much so , that i 've started using hot water to speed the process along otherwise , it 's just such drama while she waits for it this dehydrated option takes up so little room compared to dealing with clunky cans , and as long as she 's happy , i'm happy i try a different flavor everytime i order just to keep her interested so far , so good ! . 
i am not much on stuff like this , but having some issued that i think this item will take care of , i got some here local shops did not carry it , prices at flea markets and food shops were just to high the price from amazon was very good br i no longer have need of this item but if the condition returns so will i , here ! . 
these seeds always grow , unlike some other brands every single one of my cats totally loves the resulting oat grass there is nothing else that all five of them all agree on so unanimously br br thanks for such a great batch of seeds ! . 
my family has been in love with baci 's ever since we lived in europe when my daughters were small they coined the term baci pill for whenever they were hurt or not feeling well they are a wonderful treat , after a meal with espresso or cappuccino pop the entire baci in your mouth and experience the famous perugina chocolate and then the still crunchy hazelnut center the italians do everything with class and this beats a hershey 's kiss any day ! . 
perfect ! ! they are my favorite because i can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt ! . 
i think this is a love it or hate it kind of coffee i love it the flavor starts out similar to butter toffee , but then sort of morphs into coconut , pineapple , and rum i think it 's delicious and unique , and i do n't ever want to be without some in my cupboard . 
sure , i could have gone on a food crusade at the local grocery to find a similar product but i do n't think i would have found a product as good and tasty as dr mcdougall the noodles are quick and easy to prepare and above all else tasty enough to satisfy my appetite i was surprised that there were enough peanuts in every bite just like at a thai food restaurant overall , i'm pleased with my order and the quality of the product . 
a friend who 'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago even took me over to the store and bought me a pound at 7 lb in a retail store or a little over 9 with shipping from an online merchant , i think it 's great i 've been drinking earl grey , english breakfast , irish breakfast , lapsang souchong , assam , etc most of them were over 30 lb with shipping aside from the lapsang souchong , i think this is a great replacement for all the rest has everything i'm looking for in a strong , full bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring my current favorite afternoon tea unless you 're extremely jaded or a tea snob , you 'll love it . 
just received this butter yesterday and we are already using it to make sandwiches with jelly tastes great without having any salt or sugar added highly recommend ! . 
i love pamelas baking mix the 25 lb bag is quite large and the expiration is march 2 , 2010 , only 4 months after my purchase i will never be able to use that much baking mix in such a short amount of time not worth it . 
i really enjoyed this , and will probably be purchasing other flavors as well \( if they are re stocked it seems that most of them are sold out \) i wanted something a little better than what i find in my area grocery stores , and this was really good the first time we made it , it was with milk , and it was a little too rich for me \( which i thought was impressive , especially as i was only using skim milk \) , so i 've since moved to a combination of milk and water , and it tastes great \( and i 'll probably still make it with just milk , after adjusting more towards that over time \) my house is known for hot cocoa \( we have at least 7 options right now \) , but everybody who has had this has enjoyed it . 
we adopted an 8 year old dalmatian earlier this year , and heard lots of cautionary tales about special diet but we could n't pass up trying a can of this dog food sadly , just because of the name well , she loves it ! so now it 's her special occasion food we mix half a can with a cup of dry , 2x day , with no nasty side effects she also likes wingaling and the napa valley offerings from this company it 's high in protein and works for us ! . 
i ordered personal items for the first time from amazon and i was very satisfied the product came shipped securely and the description of the product matched perfectly i will order again going forward amazon has not disappointed yet i love the dove body wash ! it smells very fresh and clean and really keeps the skin moisturized well i have combination skin . 
my 2 gf df girls love this instant oatmeal we have tried many many brands for a quick breakfast option and this one is by far the best it is a bit sweeter than old fashion oatmeal , but not overbearing by any means ! great start to the day ! . 
i use this as my secret ingredient for pasta salad which is always a hit ! i also use it in chicken , tuna and egg salad and have used it in deviled eggs too i started using it also via costco and was very disappointed when they stopped carrying it i put in a request for them to start carrying it again and we 'll see what happens i'm just very happy that i can still find it somewhere ! . 
cooking with fresh ingredients always makes your dishes taste , and smell , more delicious ! highly recommend purchasing these vanilla beans , they arrived vacuum packed and ready to use . 
this is my favorite of all the choices of coffee for the new vue i do n't like strong tasting coffee i prefer dunkin donuts over starbucks until they come out with a dunkin donuts vue pack , this light roast is perfect for me . 
i had a recipe that called for a lot of dark chili powder and the only place i could find it was amazon com i bought a jar of this and it made two batches of the chili recipe i have the chili was the best i 'd ever made i can vouch that this chili powder really does make a big difference in the flavor of a chili it is rich with a bit of a kick everyone has been crazy for it , and i think its due to this chili powder i'm back to buy the bag this time ! . 
there are 4 kittens that started hanging outside the house and i started feeding them rather than buying the smaller bags , this is a great value for multiple cats the kittens love the food and always look forward to eating it shipped right to your door ca n't go wrong with that ! . 
i thought that because of the name attached that i would be wow ed its just a good average coffee nothing spectacular . 
it 's cornflour , period but , ground as only masa is to make a good corn tortilla it has great flavor tortillas can be a real pain in the fanny to make too many people worry about how it doesnt look like a commercial tortilla but , i 'll bet you that crooked as it is it will leave tia rosa in the dust the hardest part is getting the mix right after that all you need is a rolling pin and two pieces of wax paper make a few and you will get the hang br br you really do n't need a tortilla press what you really need is practice . 
this is a great and delicious way to eat thia food at home just melt the entire packet \( if you like it spicy \) into two cans of coconut milk in a pan then add your favorite meat and veggies i usually use chicken strips and a bag of frozen asian veggies . 
if you are looking for a great gluten free snack you wo n't be sorry you chose this product my favorite flavor is the apple and nut . 
i love these disposable k cups as i prefer to use my own brand \( s \) these accomplish the job perfectly and so easy to use thankyou for this product seller was prompt in shipping good packaging i will purchase again a . 
wow this was the first licorice i 'd had in two years after being diagnosed with celiac disease that was one of the hardest things to give up ! these are nice not exactly like the real thing , but close enough there are many companies that call their product licorice , but they are merely rip offs of dots candy i e nothing like real licorice very gooey and stick to your teeth these are quite firm , more like older licorice , but still a great chew it satisfied me and my craving for real licorice . 
great way to use your own coffee rather than buying k cups they are great because you do n't have to change out the holding tray and there is no mess , u just toss them like you would a k kup , no washing out of the filter every time it would be nice if there were not 3 parts to the process \( filter already in cup \) i just load up 10 at a time and am set for the week . 
i received 4 of these in my first ever omaha steaks order that i received today i was n't sure what to expect , but so far , i 've been pleased i tore the plastic open , put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious the cheese filling was crispy on top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft no way would they come out as good if put in the microwave , so i 'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go now , you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what omaha charges for these alone , but as long as you get a good deal on the omaha website , these simply make a great addition to any omaha steaks order as delicious are they are though , i would n't order a box of just these off the site due to the added shipping costs but like i said , as long as they 're part of a nicely priced packaged deal , i 'll definitely take them actually , i probably would n't order any packaged deal in the future from omaha that did n't include these a big plus , at least for me , is if you check the ingredients list on these , there 's no partially hydrogenated oils , so there 's no traces of trans fats , which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes also no high fructose corn syrup , which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus if you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example , chances are , the butter used , sour cream , etc will be full of chemicals , trans fats high fructose corn syrup these , not so much so there is a definite degree of quality with omahas stuffed baked potatoes each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat , which is 42 the drv , but that 's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon , cheese and sour cream i was also expecting there to be no fiber , but it turns out there 's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half another plus overall , the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy , being made with quality ingredients . 
great ! hot chocolate ! by far the best kcup hot chocolate i have found i use a little milk or half and half and it 's so good i definitely will order again ! thanks for the super fast shipping ! . 
happybaby happymunchies baked organic cheese and veggie snack , cheddar cheese carrot , 1 63 ounces \( pack of 6 \) br br hello , this is six items should be installed , but i only received a , i with amazon contact but nobody reason i , please verify as soon as possible , give me reissue , thank you ! ! ! ! . 
i'm constantly looking for healthy dog treats that are not crazy expensive these are one of the better deals i could find when considering cost ounce my lab absolutely loves them and they are good for him too the treats are soft and moist , which is a plus for my dog they could easily be broken into smaller pieces , but i generally just give my dog a whole one when he does something good i would n't keep them in my pocket because they do smell a bit it 's not an overly offensive smell , but strong enough that you do n't want to carry it around with you all day br br i definitely recommend these for all dogs . 
i liked this so much that i re ordered and will keep br br re ordering . 
this is the best mustard my husband loves it on his sandwiches for work it has the right spices and taste to enhance what you are eating have been looking for it in bigger tubes with not much luck but any size is great . 
love these snacks ! they 're a little bit sweet , loads of crunchy almonds am looking forward to trying the other varieties , too . 
the m m candy machine works just fine but the finger hole is too small for adult fingers to retrieve the candy it does intimidate a m m lover because of the small amount it dispenses . 
i had a kerig before and it broke the company said it was because i was using expresso in the k cup and it was to fine and cloged the machine kerig does not make a k cup with spanish coffee so when i found these i was very happy i have been using these for about a month and i love them and it is so much cheaper i would highly recommend these . 
these are identical to jay 's hot chips \( are they made by the same company \? \) they have a slightly sweet taste , with a nice bit of heat definately not overwhelming heat , on a heat scale of 1 5 , i would give these about a 2 regarding the texture , these are not kettle cooked chips , so they do not have much crunch , they are comparable to regular lays chips for about 1 a bag , they are a great deal . 
my grandson and husband love to bond drinking this hot chocolate together i get it every other month i ca n't ever be without it . 
our baby loves it and amazon is very reliable and fast free super saver shipping is always a good deal thanks amazon . 
first , yuban is my favorite coffee to be able to buy a case and save is great the coffee was in date , the seals on the cans were excellent , and the freshness of the coffee was excellent i will definitely buy more yuban coffee when i need it from amazon groceries . 
i really love this sugar and price wise it 's much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else . 
these prunes saved so many of my baby 's uncomfortable constipation days when he started on solids the puree seems to be easier to consume than prune juice and we used to give it to our baby with yogurt it soon became his favorite food and eased his symptoms i highly recommend this product to parents who are having a hard time with their babies' constipation . 
cant find this flavor in the stores , so bought them here online like them so much better than the peppermint ones i also like the cinnamon ones yum o \( as rachel ray states \) . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b001eq5ejq la tourangelle roasted walnut oil , 16 9 ounce cans \( pack of 3 \) a br i had already ordered this and had two left in my refrigerator , having given one to my brother he shared it with mutual friends , who loved it too , so i ordered another package for christmas gifts to those who had fallen in love with it after tasting his sharing i then used it \( 1 c \) in my peanut butter chocolate chip cookie recipe \( see review of skippy natural creamy pb \) this arrived today and i have to cheer ! br br thank you so much ! this product was securely and snuggly packaged in the perfect sized box so it did not slide about or damage itself ! thank you so much amz for giving due attention to appropriate and proper packaging to these three cans of walnut oil ! perfect ! \( yay ! \) br br it is lovely and so yummy that i also ordered a set of the pecan oil too br a href http www amazon com gp product b001po7fbw la tourangelle roasted pecan oil , 8 45 ounce tin a br br and , remember to check out the others pistachio , hazelnut , pumpkin , almond , etc br this is a great answer for those of us with non nut food allergies \( dairy , soy , gluten , lime , mint , grapes \) that allow us to use these oils to give some enchantment to our cooking and baking i subbed it for the peanut oil in my pb cookies and it added a nice note to them like christmas ! yumm ! br br remember , \( like so many other helpful reviewers advise \) to keep it in the refrig ! . 
this stuff makes great pancakes and shortcake that i am actually allowed to eat ! br my doctor tells me i'm celiac this was three years ago now i just hope i can continue to find this bisquick ! . 
outstanding ! delicious ! what on earth are these things \? simple they 're a yummy mix of nuggets made from organic popcorn and organic dry roasted soybeans they 're so delicious your head may actually explode once you taste them slightly unsalted , but majorly addictive , these crunchy snacks are good for you . 
excellent choice for a high fiber cracker these taste great and like other back to nature items , do n't have all the undesirable ingredients you 'd like to avoid if necessary whole wheat , safflower oil , salt and vitamin e perfect . 
it really is ! i am not a fan of carbonated drinks because most of them are simply not healthy i even know people who have developed physical problems because of too much consumption of them , especially those who even drink them as a starter in the morning br br but this one is different it has a real full bodied orange tangerine flavor , although the label says it is combined with other juice concentrates apple , grape and acerola juice \( i had to look that one up it is the cherrylike fruit of a small tree of the west indies which has a high concentration of vitamin c \) anyway , it 's just darned good ! br br i experimented a little on the best way to serve i drank it cold as is , then poured it over a glass of ice cubes neither of those ways seemed quite right then i poured the beverage on ice , left it for a minute , then removed the ice by pouring juice through a strainer this left it nice and chilled , not just cold , and not weakened by melting ice br br i live in the colorado desert where temperatures are scorching in the summers orange juice does n't quite quench my almost constant thirst , but has been the best thing available to me until now yes , i will definitely switch to switch , forgive the pun ! br br it 's actually good for you too hope one day it will be in all schools . 
this melitta decaf riviera sunset coffee has an excellent taste there is none of the weird aftertaste you get with some other decaf coffees it 's a smooth , mellow taste , even a little sweet and with a hint of cocoa i really enjoyed this the grind is listed as extra fine , but i did n't find it particularly fine myself when i grind my own beans , i have a finer grind than this , but i still expected a stronger taste from the melitta than i would from other store brands however , the melitta decaf was actually slightly weaker than other store brands we have tried we like our coffee strong , about 1 2 cup ground coffee for 4 to 4 1 2 cups water \( using measuring cups \) this ratio was not quite strong enough for me with the melitta , but that is easily adjustable the nice thing about the coffee is that , even when i made it very strong , the smoothness remained i will definitely be trying other types of melitta coffee in the future . 
these k cups are just what my son wanted ! the price was excellent and the flavor is rich i would recommend these to anyone wanting a good cup of instant hot cocoa . 
i use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks with the high price of cocoa on the commodity market , this is an excellent price , especially for an organic product the cocoa is less tasty than my regular brand , but does very well for the price my main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with no label i would like to see an organic label , as well as , the nutrition info for the product . 
great price for the 24 count , my dad will love this gift since he loves hot chocolate and drinks about three cups a day , quick to receive . 
we are white popcorn enthusiasts , and were very pleased with this product large , tender kernels of poped corn used an electric , self stirring poper worth the cost . 
my husband said it tastes wonderful ! ! just like you would get in a restaurant creamy and flavorful ! hightly recommends this product ! . 
my four year old chinese crested mix loves these dog treats he is somewhat of a picky eater when it comes to dog treats but he loves these they smell nice and minty and take a little while for him to eat so it gives him something to work at they are made with good ingredients no meat byproducts or corn ! and they are made in the usa which is definite plus i will continue to get these for my pup . 
i 've never had sunchy malta before \( i drank a lot of goya when it was available locally \) tastes similar to goya , though with less of a sour taste and slightly less carbonation br br i ordered 50 bottles in order to get free shipping said bottles arrived in 4 large boxes , with each bottle individually packed none broke at the time of purchase , this was the best deal going for malta either locally or in stores \( i 've never paid less than fifty cents anywhere \) br br now , though , the free shipping is gone unless sunchy seriously expects me to drop 7 50 for shipping per bottle , it 's unlikely i 'll be buying anymore they should consider selling by the pack or case if they wish to pursue the online business model br br so , 5 stars for value and the quality of packing , with the caveat that i wo n't be buying any more until sunchy figures out how to sell it . 
product was as described it was shipped promptly and i will be consuming it as part of a medically supervised diet it is the only bread that i'm allowed . 
this has been my favorite brand of coconut water of the ones i 've tried they use real fruit juice for flavoring , as well as it tastes good br br we tried the smaller size , and they just are n't large enough to get enough water at the gym , and are not resealable br br things i like about this br br perfect size for an hour long gym routine br resealable cap \( smaller one lacks this \) br tasty \( like a pina colada \) br br negative br br box makes it hard to get the last drops usually end up squishing it up to get the last bit br br so great coconut water , perfect size , and cheaper than buying locally at sprouts with the amazon 's 'subscribe and save' ! . 
makes perfect , delicious , crisp on the outside and soft on the inside , waffles in minutes worth every penny ! . 
looking for bits as real blueberries seem to have no flavor these days these were very good , would def buy again . 
this coffee is great because it 's all organic ingredients ! no pesticides to worry about , plus it tastes good , and you have the healing effects for ganoderma . 
after taking my first sip of switch orange tangerine , i raised a suspicious eyebrow because it did n't taste the way i expected it to then it dawned on me that my mouth was prepared for more of a fake , amped up orange soda , but what i was tasting was real , natural juice yes , i knew that from the label , but that 's not the same as experiencing it br br the taste was a nice blend of orange and tangerine , not too sweet , and the carbonation adds a nice touch a bit like a non alcoholic mimosa cocktail br br my only reservation is that the calorie count is \( perhaps unavoidably \) too high for me to drink this on a regular basis though let me be quick to point out that this is a no sugar added product for those who are n't counting calories , a nice refreshing switch from soft drinks ! . 
as mentioned give this a try ! instant party food , frozen meatballs and this sauce great on chicken , you name it anything party snack happy hour food that you put sauce on would work with this br br however the prices from some of the vendors obscene 19 for 2 25oz bottles \? \? this stuff is 1 50 1 75 for the 10oz bottle at any asian grocery . 
i am very satisfied with my twizzler purchase i shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them i will definitely be ordering more . 
this is my favorite granola bar ! being vegan and gluten free is difficult when it comes to finding granola bars that meet my needs this one is absolutely delicious ! i love the ingredients and all the strawberries throughout the whole bar highly recommend ! ! ! . 
we have used the victor fly bait for 3 seasons ca n't beat it great product ! . 
i am not a huge coconut fan , so i was n't excited about trying this , but with one sip it definitely won me over ! the flavor is perfect and is now one of the flavors in our regular rotation and it smells so good ! ! ! . 
my son is a sb fanatic so i was so excited to find this for the 2010 holiday season as every year we do some version of gingerbread i knew by reading reviews that there would n't be enough yellow frosting so i whipped up so edible glue \( water and confectionery sugar \) to hold the levels of gingerbread that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside this worked great it was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating the licorice was worthless though . 
my wife like these better that the swedish version , wasa , as she finds the taste better and likes the thinness of the product we will buy again . 
i love these chips and could n't contain my happiness when i recieved my box ! ! love them , if you love spicy foods get these ! ! . 
this is a much better hot chocolate than some of the reviews would have you believe my wife does not drink coffee \( calls it yuck \) and i am very particular about my coffee , but we agree that this is an absolutely delightful hot chocolate i use a medium cup size setting and it seems to be the best one for this brew this chocolate comes in as a not so close second to some of the great hot chocolates we have had while traveling europe , however this did save us airfare but this is not at all bad for an instant cup of pleasure adding marshmallows or topping with whipped cream would take it over the top br br if you are one of the ones who wants to throw yours away , please send my way i will get rid of them for you thanks ! \) br br i got this product directly from keurig as one of my two free when i registered my new brewer and purchased two could not beat that price here , but at normal prices , this is the deal br br from the package 60 calories , 2g fat , 11g carbohydrate , 1g fiber , 7 g sugar , 1g protein ingredients sugar , alkalized cocoa powder , creamer \( and all of those ingredients , etc . 
like other reviewers , i had low expectations for this gum , but was happily wrong i love key lime pie , and lime flavor in general when first chewed , this gum has the tangy bite of key lime , with a creamy sweetness , and a hint of graham cracker crust flavor after the initial flavor burst fades , there is that surge of artificial sugary sweetness that occurs with some brands flavors of sugarfree chewing gum , but the surge is n't as overwhelming or long lasting as it is with some sugarfree gums once that fades , the gum has a mellow , subtle , lime zest flavor i really like this gum . 
this is really tasty hot chocolate i like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference . 
we have a michigan based coffee cafe \( now renamed biggby 's \) that stomps starbucks \( biggby 's was originally named beaners , a name that encountered resistance as the franchise spread \) their br dark roasts are to die for none of the k cups come close \( except possibly for g m espresso \) so this build it yourself k cup is a near perfect solution the downside is that the brewing takes much longer and there is a bit of splatter also the caps are a bit difficult to snap down recommended . 
wow ! this product is very impressive i bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging , price and shipping the powder dissolves instantly even in water ! i 've just been mixing a 1 4 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great ! , but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next this product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries , especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away i think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well i'm excited to add more of the superfoods to my diet in this fast and easy way i definitely will being trying the other flavors soon . 
we love this stuff ! ! ! i use it in my heat and eat breakfasts i make in advance so i do n't have to cook every morning my wife uses it for all kinds of recipes including just as really good gravy we used to buy it all the time in california but it 's not sold locally so we have to mail order it much less expensive from amazon even over the manufacturer for us the larger 4 5 oz size is much more economical than the 2 5 oz . 
i saw an article on yahoo and figured i would give it a try this stuff was unbelievable i ate healthy foods for the first try some carrots , spinach , a red pepper and an orange it was probably the best meal i had ever tasted it was like i was eating a fruit picked from eden on the downside i could see this becoming an addiction ! . 
to the gentleman who reviewed this and said just go to the store and get better , well , i'm disabled and the disability van only allows us two packages to carry can you see me carrying two big cases of water home \? i think not br br this is wonderful water sure , you could get it on sale at a better price , and if you can drive or have someone to drive you and carry it in , please do so , but for me it is a sweet deal i ordered six cases and watched the ups guy set them inside the door for me i have nothing to complain about if the price is right for you , with all considered , you wo n't go wrong here . 
so i got this and tasted it strait out of the bottle , it tasted like smoky flavored milk yuck ! i was depressed i was stuck with 4 bottles of this it sat on my shelf and i forgot about it last weekend i tasted a zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor , it tasted weird and smokey like the lorann oil i had gotten i tried to doctor up the soda with a little sf vanilla torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream it tasted amazing ! ! ! the odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel br br so i wanted to see if this would help the lorann oil too i put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it , it tasted fine then i added one drop of the oil , it is very strong , and stirred it in it tasted so much better ! i whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat br br now i will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream it was such a happy accident to find out how to use it when added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream br br it is very potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting , if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch . 
i switched to this food from blue buffalo i hate to say it , but around the time blue started doing tv commercials the food started upsetting my dog 's stomach perhaps that 's a coincidence , but it was a reason to switch regardless of the timing the newman 's food has been great my dog loves the food he has been energetic and in great health not much more that you could ask the bag of treats that comes in the 12 5 lb bag is a fantastic bonus to every bag . 
these have a stronger caramel flavor although still a medium strength coffee the best caramel flavored k cup i 've tried ! i will reorder them . 
i have found this cat food to be the purrfect choice for both my cat with ibd and my cat with diabetes howard and miss c are thriving on this diet of turkey and brown rice and enjoy it so much more than prescription diets the price was great too for a premium cat food . 
i do n't review much , but i have been buying this brand for my irish wolfhound for over 2 years now he still loves it and it 's good for him if you have a large breed dog , this dog food will be a good choice for healthy food . 
this is my wife 's favorite she grew up in seattle and has consumed countless gallons of various types of coffee in her lifetime so i assume this is good coffee she is also my wine taster as her palate is much more sensitive than mine . 
this taste is between something like flax bread and cornbread excellent toasted with butter and jelly did not raise my blood sugar at all i love it . 
if you are trying to get off sugar , this is the product for you i has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin , and no bitter aftertaste great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy i love this product . 
i ordered this product to send to my friend 's husband they had just moved to alabama in the end of march , she could not find any diet peach snapple that tasted the same as what they had bought up here in new jersey he said that the water that was used down south made the diet peach snapple taste different ! so , now she is happy because she has found a source that they can buy his snapple from ! thank you . 
i bought this because it was a very good price it was really good though i love mixing a peppermint with a dark chocolate and having a double sized up of hot cocoa br br will keep buying this until they do n't sell it anymore it is really creamy i like it best with 6 ounces of water , gives it a thicker feel . 
i was just a little wary ordering this because of the other reviews that said it was super salty and way too tough but i gave it a shot anyway i do n't know if it was because i ordered a different flavor \( teriyaki \) or if i just got lucky nonetheless , i think these jerky strips are some of the best i 've ever had i will admit to the fact that they are just a little salty , but nothing an ice cold cola or beer of your choice wo n't fix as per being tough , i munched down five or six right out of the container as soon as i opened it i just could n't stop myself , they were that good for all that chewing my jaw is none the worse for the wear so for those of you out there that are real jerky fans , this is definitely worth trying br br update i did a little research because i was curious as to why everyone thought this jerky was too salty i looked up the nutrition facts on all 4 flavors both the original peppered contain 650mg of sodium , the wood smoked had 570mg , and the teriyaki has only 440mg of sodium so if you thought the others were too salty , or are worried about this jerky being too salty , try the teriyaki i highly recommend it it 's not too salty , just a hint of sweet from the teriyaki , but still nice pepper flavor as well . 
was looking for a strong k cup that could hold up for the perfect espresso and for a great cup of coffee ! now receiving on auto ship , if you 're looking for a great bold k cup , this is it . 
my min pin , snickers seems to enjoy the heck out of these small treats they are the perfect size for his tiny little mouth thank you . 
this is my favorite coffee flavor and i have not had it in a long time forgot how delicious it was until we ordered the k cups love them , already ordered more . 
great price and my cat loves this food he has been on it for 9 years my vet says he is the healthest cat he sees . 
superior flavor , not too green , not too black loved it from the first cup i put a hint of splenda sugar blend in mine and am substituting it for coffee these days stumbled on it in a shop but will be getting it thru amazon in the future i am here now because after tasting it i wanted to be sure i could buy it on line and have it delivered to the door again , a definite yes product ! maggiemay . 
this wolfgang puck coffee tasted great the vanilla flavoring is just right some reviews said it was not so good , not enough flavoring , etc do n't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here i have never posted for a product and i have tried many different k cups this is a good k cup and do n't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback i almost hesitated and did n't buy it and then i figured i would give it a shot it was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor you will enjoy it it tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor . 
we 've been using walnut oil for many years we brush it on toast to take the place of butter , eliminating much of the saturated fat from our diets it 's also wonderful in salads try it tossed into greens with a few nuts and chopped stone fruit or grapes , and a fruity vinegar this product is of excellent quality and amazon has a great price for it . 
quality food but the price is very high luv amazon 's free ship over 25 . 
my partner is very happy with the tea , and is feeling much better since starting to drink it br she has been drinking it both hot \( normal \) and iced \( chilled \) and likes the refreshing nature of it . 
shipped in great shape i gave these to my son , he is the one who uses reg coffee and he really likes these disposable k cups i guess i will still have to send him coffee beans every mo . 
i ordered this product because i wanted alternative to peanut butter and it is organic i actually prefer the creamy sunflower taste over peanut butter now definitely would buy again ! . 
i have recently been on a low carb diet , as i find that i can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave , honey , and dates these raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin , a hormone whose message is store fat ! insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore i would bloat from a high carb diet br br my dilemma is that i love sweets and now it is not a problem , thanks to products like stevia , a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years it has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar \( although for some people there might be a bit , as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar \) stevia used to be legal in the usa only as a cosmetic product because of politics companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition yet , aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis so i would use stevia at times , but the aftertaste was bad and to be honest , i was n't too crazy about the during taste either br br then i tried nunaturals this product is awesome and like no other stevia i have tried it is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste \( unless you put in way too much a common mistake by people new to this \) it comes in tablets and in powdered form \( in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings \) it also comes in alcohol free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor unlike aspartame \( which becomes even more toxic when heated \) stevia can be used in baking nunaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that \( since i am a raw fooder , i ca n't tell you how it tastes , but i am sure it is good , judging by their other products \) br br thanks to these great products , i can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets ! . 
i was surprised to learn that amazon sells gevalia coffee , which led me to search amazon for other household items at great prices i wish all shopping could be this easy br br update 12 24 11 how can the price go from 15 00 to over 47 00 yikes i guess no more gevalia for me if that price is correct \? . 
my husband and i enjoy a really good cup of tea lana 's snowflake black tea sounded so interesting and the five star reviews made it simply irresistible i had to try it the delivery was very fast and it was nicely packaged when my husband saw we had new tea he had to open it the next thing i heard , wow , you have got to smell this the aroma is so wonderful , the sweet scent from the coconut and almond fills the air and the hints of vanilla are simply divine while the fresh aroma is intense the smooth taste is beyond compare , a great substitute to after dinner desserts its calming essence makes it great for a quiet evening at home be prepared to indulge your senses br br snowflake tea now has to be our favorite tea i plan to buy it as stocking stuffers for my friends and family lana , keep creating this tea , i plan to buy a lot more . 
this product produces excellent \( outstanding \) belgian waffles in my waring pro waffle iron they exceed anything you may buy in a restaurant truly ! however , at 5 per box , the cost of the other ingredients you must add , time to prepare , and the small amount of product in the box , i suggest you look at other gluten free products from pamela 's , the gluten free pantry , bob 's red mill , or arrowhead mills you may see a better value for your food dollars incidentally , arrowhead mills products are equally as tasty and easy to prepare , but i believe you are getting more product in the bag feeding a family of 4 would be a crap shoot at best with a single box of this product br br if the manufacturer were to repackage the product with more content per box and drop the price , i would have given it 5 stars safeway was the first store in san francisco to offer this product and placed it in the center of its baking products now , however , it has fallen to lowest shelf level with some prices sold by higher end grocers approaching 6 per box forget it at those prices hey , it 's largely ultra fine white rice flour and super fine sugar ! br br bisquick would also benefit from a buckwheat gf product in its inventory i would certainly buy it . 
this is very good dog treat our chihauhua loves them it is her favorite they are semisoft , so the older dogs with few teeth can enjoy them . 
this spice can be tricky to get good quality and this one arrived quick and the flavors are spot on , use it to marinate fish or chicken then grill it , love it ! . 
the first time i ordered this it came all melted but amazon was quick to remedy the situation by sending me another of the product and it was great thank you . 
several gevalia brand coffee 's have been among my favorites for years velvet noir , signature blend , traditional roast , etc the breakfast blend is my go to every day grind it 's got a perfect blend of bold rich taste , terrific aroma , and full taste , with very low acidity and harshness just incredible coffee ! . 
best taste pasta cooks very well , slightly less time than typical mass produced pasta nice color and mouthfeel just excellent . 
my son made this he did n't have the patience to be precise about the water temperature and when , half an hour before it was done , it appeared not to have risen at all i feared for the worse determined to be polite , i agreed to have a sandwich using the bread it was amazing apparently it rises during the baking or something br br great tangy flavor \( perfect for a meat sandwich imho \) and not heavy at all fortunately we had lots of deli meats , since the whole loaf disappeared within the hour br br we 've had all but the sourdough peasant bread so far i'm sure that will be delicious as well . 
it 's a great flavor and makes a great cup of coffee i fine you can have more than 1 cup of this coffee and not feel like it 's too much of a flavored coffee puck has captured a great flavor with this coffee . 
the pop chips are really incredible they are very flavorful and crispy my favorite is the bbq , but that is just me , they are all good i would highly recommend these to anyone who is watching their weight of just for overall better health . 
after several less successful stews with curry powder , i turned to this curry sauce mix br it is incredibly easy to get delicious curry stew with simple food stuffs , only with my basic cooking skills while imitating the way of cooking curry in animes br though it is my philosophy that good cuisine should be made from scratch , but his time i just surrendered to its convenience to get exactly the taste i want with such a simple process br one small problem is that it is too mild for me though it is labeled medium hot . 
i am not a great milk producer and ha e had to supplement my last 4 children , with two i made my own , with the next i used the powder , not that i have my sixth baby i wanted something quick and easy but also organic i have been happy with this so far i do n't like using formula but i decided it was better than killing myself with constant pumping and stressing that i did not have enough ! br price was better than the store , i would love to see it on subscribe and save though . 
i started loving oolong tea after i discovered a bottled product called 'tejava' that product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle i needed something less expensive so i tried this 'prince of peace' brand oolong br br after a few brewing experiments , i now love this stuff br br what i have learned if brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak if you put this tea in boiling water , it may come out bitter br br i now heat up my water in a microwave until it is , very hot to the touch , but no way near boiling i then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes \( i like strong tea \) i have , to my taste , duplicated the 'tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost br br enjoy br br ken . 
they all taste really good it comes in mango , strawberry , and red bean they are each individually wrapped so you only have to eat one at a time there are 20 of each flavor as well when i finish this canister i plan on buying another . 
my 14 month old daughter can not tolerate cows milk or soy while she was an infant , she had to drink nutramigen formula and would only drink maybe 4 oz at a time once she turned a year old , and i began giving her meyenberg goat 's milk , she began to guzzle it ! she loves it so much ! she now consistently drinks 8 12 ounces at a time ! br br i mix one can \( powdered \) at a time , which makes approx one gallon we go through about a gallon every 2 days ! br br this milk is such a blessing ! we highly recommend it ! amazon has the best price , too it 's so much more convenient and less expensive to purchase it on here and have it delivered to us rather than make countless \( and expensive \) trips to the health food store . 
my mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven they did n't believe they deserved receiving these , but i know they did deserve to receive these ! . 
i love this kool aid mix and they stopped selling it at my local albertsons \( boooooooooooo \) luckily i found it here and it is even cheaper than it was in store ! ! . 
these chips are quite tasty and the price is right packaged very well , would buy again . 
i have been having blood sugar and yeast issues , and i 've had to cut out sugar i had never tried sugar free kool aid before , so i was a bit nervous about this one luckily i found the taste to be really good even my picky kids love it ! br br i love the fact that these come pre sweetened in individual pouches you just tear one open and stir it into 2 quarts of water it could n't be faster or easier ! it even dissolves well in cold water br br i just ordered a case of the cherry flavor , too my kids and i ca n't get enough of the tropical punch flavor , so we 're excited to try cherry , too . 
my family loves all three flavors the dark chocolate is my favorite the price was unbeatable i will buy this product again . 
i 've always wanted to like coconut water low in calories , high in minerals but i 've just never liked the taste much the pineapple juice in this really makes a difference it still needs to be well chilled to be good , but it makes a healthy post workout drink . 
wagyu beef is a kobe beef japanese cow crossbred with an american cow it 's the best possible beef you can get in the us and is not illegal . 
i have never tasted any better ! need to keep refrigerated or it will lose color and flavor but is worth the price . 
it tastes good and is little sweet so my first thought was that it had a lot of sugar i looked on the box and was surprised that it did not have that much \( a plus for me \) . 
this is the perfect size for a snack bag for school minus one star because the glue for the straws also glues the wrapper to all of the boxes that 's annoying . 
i had no idea something could taste this good i'm not really a caramel person , but if i had dreamed up the most perfect balance between sweet salty buttery richness it would be these caramel sea salt squares i found them at whole foods and they are expensive , but worth every penny milk is the perfect compliment get some and you will not be disappointed you may be ruined for chocolate brownies . 
i have a sweet tooth and so does my three year old son this is a great after dinner dessert that i feel good about giving him and myself they are healthy and you can taste the flax seed in them , but i have really grown to love that healthy taste and texture i even come to crave it now they are satisfying and filling and my whole family loves them i buy them in bulk and love other hodgson mill products as well br br if you eat nothing but white flour products and ca n't get used to or absolutly hate whole grains and their taste and texture , then this is not the product for you if you are the family that tries to make healthy choices and have healthier alternitives then this is a wonderful product i still love to have my junk food \( pillsbury and hershey 's here i come ! ! ! \) i just try to have it only on very special occasions the rest of the time i choose to nurish my body and satisfy my taste buds that is when i reach for this brownie mix br br my only complaint is that they do n't taste too great after only a couple days so make up a batch , eat em' up quick \( within 2 days \) and you will be smiling ! . 
not the best i 've ever had , but good the best i 've had was expensive and from an english company \( i ca n't remember the name \) but this is better than the movie kind they 're not quite as moist and rich as the best ones i 've tried . 
i'm known to be nuts for nuts , and i 've tried nuts from around the world , as friends bring them back for me as gifts very near the top of the list of the best nut snacks is mrs may 's almond crunch from the first time i tasted it , to every time i eat it now , i am amazed at the crunchiness , quality of the almonds , lightly sweetened glaze which is very unbrittle like , attention to healthiness in the ingredients , etc as a side note , because of how much i was impressed by this product , i went on a tasting spree by buying about 12 different kinds of mrs may 's products , from the peanut and cashew crunches to the various sesame crunches , etc perhaps i'm biased to the original , but none of the others have that same magic i would rate the rest as 4 stars but the almond crunch should get 6 stars . 
fast delivery and good product this is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it 's really handy to have around to add to sauces , dressings , etc such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it , nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with . 
my husband and i both like coffee with rich flavor and good taste , but we do not like the bitter or burnt taste some coffees have this community hazelnut has excellent flavor we make it fairly strong and are very pleased with this coffee . 
wow this chocolate raspberry flavored coffee is the absolute best we have ever had and i can honestly say we have tried quite a few in our time and of course the price ca n't be beat unless you find someone who wants to sell you some that fell off the back of some delivery truck . 
i enjoyed this product they are a good value for the amount you get i did not sense much honey in the product , so a bit more flavor would be nice i would buy again . 
oetker products are always the best i 've used them for years because they have unique items that are tasty and easy to prepare you absolutly cannot go wrong with this creme brulee why spend a ton of money at a restaurant when you can serve it by candlelight at home \? . 
i hate flavored coffee , unless it is flavored with dark rum ! this coffee is awesome i got a variety pack of these potful packs and there were ony 3 of 20 that i liked this is the only one i reordered .

this is a great price for powdered goat milk at the local health food store \( the only place in town that carries goat milk \) , i buy just one of these cans for 15 20 for three cans is the best price i 've found ! br br i use goat milk for my children , when they are in the process of weaning , and as long as they want it it is so much healthier than formula because , well , it 's not soy or dairy based , and has no chemicals and added vitamins that try to mimic breastmilk goat milk is more similar to breastmilk than dairy , so is much easier for humans to digest than cow milk i find it to be a great alternative for babies as they adjust , or for those who cannot tolerate dairy br br for warm bottles for my 14 month old , i just heat water on the stove , then pour it into her glass bottle with a scoop of goat milk shake it up and she has her favorite drink \( other than momma 's milk , of course \) ! . 
i love chi chi 's corn cake and i love that i can purchase it from amazon my local grocery store stopped carrying it and i was so happy to see that i could order it from amazon i would give it 5 stars but not everyone in my family loves it \( i do n't know why , it is so yummy \) it is a delicious side to any mexican meal ! .

extremely good deal i placed the order on tuesday , got the package on saturday the packaging is very good \( vanilla beans are vacuum packed as well as comes with a heavy ziploc bag for after you open the vacuum pack \) 1 2 vanilla bean is about a little over 50 vanilla beans every grocery store i go \( wegmans , whole foods , weiss etc etc \) that carries vanilla beans usually only sells them in packets of 2 vanilla beans for typically 12 so if you buy 50 vanilla beans 2 at a time for 12 each , thats 300 ! so basically you 're saving 272 31 . 
this stuff is the bomb br there is no pepper that has a tastier fruity flavor than the habanero the fact that is fiery hot is both a bonus , \( for us heat lovers \) and a curse \( for the wussies \) br i use this stuff all the time sprinkle it on a sandwich over the tomato , sprinkle it over some mexican sour cream for a dip sprinkle on pizza or a cucumber and tomato salad the uses are near endless br br also if you wanted to use it in lieu of mace or pepper spray , a little bit of this stuff blown onto any skin location rapidly induces excitement br be careful in the sprinkling of this stuff , if you get a smal puff of it into your nose , you will most definately know about it p . 
yes , i am having a cup right now i went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee i paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money highly recommend . 
i live on salt and as a result have hypertension these products work surprisingly fast to lower your high blood pressure and to put it as nice as possible , keep you alive longer and , that is a scientific fact , as salt is only a habit and has no real useful pupose except to cause many unhealthy habits and conditions keep caring about us and do n't stop producing foods that are very healthy . 
of course they do n't taste quite as good as regular brownies but hello \? that 's because they 're healthy ! and that being said , they are fantastic ! why eat crap when there are such good alternatives ! \? . 
my daughter has been gf for about 4 years now we have discovered that if the main ingredient is rice flour , it usually is n't any good it is usually grainy this is n't the case with this product it makes fantastic pancakes \( the rest of the family would eat them \) she did n't like the biscuits so we wo n't make those again we used it to make corn dogs and the entire family \( and a friend \) ate them no one even noticed everyone loved them br br amazon has since taken this off of the subscribe and save i am so mad i hope they put it back on soon . 
if you like a lot of flavor in each bite , this is it a little messy to handle but worth the fuss ! ! ! . 
i have been searching for hot sauces and peppers to compliment my cuisine and i finally found it for those of you that do n't like everything as hot as the insanity sauce , their are others that are less intense in the grouping for anyone wanting to use these sauces , read the instructions on the bottles good job dave ! ! ! . 
this is the absolute best gum flavor ever it really tastes like key lime pie and the flavor lasts a long time yummy ! . 
this is a great product i was a chip a holic and knew i needed to cut back on them then i was introduced to pop chips i have found my alternative these chips are great ! low in fats but high in flavor i purchsed a mixed case with multiple flavors and was not disappointed with any of them consider this product for your alternative to the high fat chips available everywhere i am sure these will catch on and become a big hit . 
got this for like 10 on a warehouse deal it was a bargain ! i received them in early may and the label says best before june at a rate of one can per 2 3 days , i do n't think i 'll have a problem finishing them off before june \( i know , i have a sweet tooth \) all 4 cans had some dents on them but the condition of the gulab jamun inside was good they were just as described soft cheese balls \( about 20 per can \) in a sugar syrup with just a hint of cardamom warm it up a before eating for the maximum flavor and texture . 
better than expected , but the peppermint flavor lacks a mint smell or taste this is a good purchase for the price . 
dark and full flavored , but distinctly columbian this is a great morning coffee better cup of am joe than you will get at a coffee place . 
this is not as tall as they advertised but we kept it and we like it alot it is the shining star of our indoor bonsai collection just stunning like having a forest in your kitchen ! we 've had it about 6 months now and it 's thriving . 
these are the best skinless boneless sardines that i 've tried and they are very reasonably priced they remind me a little more of tuna fish than sardines , but in a mild , rather than bad , way and are very firm for water packed fish i especially like these mixed with salsa they work out to 1 57 can or 36 oz if you choose the longer , but free , shipping . 
i am a coffee snob yes , i admit it i prefer fresh roasted kenyan coffee , but also like sumatran , jamacan , guatamalan , even etheopian i generally say that i do n't drink columbian most k cups are weak and less than stellar , though i have found several i enjoy i was surprised by caribou 's mahogany ! it is excellent strong enough with an earthy , winey taste and smoothe finish \( my description \) i eagerly tried their daybreak , to my disappointment just ordinary i do n't often write reviews , but if this can get someone else to enjoy mahogany it is well worth the time if you have similar taste in coffee give it a try ! ! \( and no , i do n't work for them \) . 
this is the good stuff ! i am eating some right now with some sweet basil tomato sauce this pasta has a neat shape and it cooks up nicely it 's colorful and tasty and is great al dente . 
my three year old daughter has been drinking this brand of goat milk for the last 2 years because she is dairy intolerant this is a great product easy to carry \( because it 's a powder \) and mix it when you need it and , this is an awesome price 10 00 less than i usually pay for three cans . 
this is my favorite progresso soup the broth has excellent flavor and it 's not too salty yes the veggies could be a bit firmer , but the pieces are large and tasty it has some heat already , but i usually add a few shots of hot sauce to suit my taste if i really want to indulge , i 'll chop up a few pieces of smoked sausage and add it before heating heaven ! . 
ahmad tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea great flavor with no lingering aftertaste . 
we like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market they are even great by themselves we will order these as long as they are available thank you for making them accessable br br shelly kenyon . 
this is the best popcorn i have ever had as a kid i ran the popcorn machine in a theater so i feel i know what i'm talking about we used yellow popcorn but i still think white is best . 
i have had waffles from other mixes that are too sweet i have also made them from scratch br i like my waffles with no sugar in them , because i do n't like too much sugar this mix is very good waffles are just the right consitancy for me and the mix is easy to prepare . 
one of my favorite restaurants serves this tea iced they were kind enough to share the brand name with me when i asked it makes wonderful , refreshing and healthful iced tea highly recommend . 
i switched to decaf and was looking for a decent cup on the keurig machine i was only interested in subscribe and save options br br this is a fairly light roast , which i like i brew on the middle setting and i think if it was brewed any larger i would think it was too light . 
i bought the vanilla beans to make diy vanilla extract i do alot of baking and i like to use good vanilla the recipe requires moist , full vanilla beans and these were wonderful the vanilla beans came in a vacuum pack that kept them in very good condition , much better than buying them from the spice section of the grocery store where the jar contains 2 to 3 dehydrated beans and they made great vanilla extract for much less money than buying the 'real' vanilla at the store . 
great if you are cutting back on fat , they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them extremely dry and hard . 
my wife and i both thought this is a nice cup of coffee the bag has a one way valve on it to keep the air out and arrived virtually flat when brewed in our cuisinart drip coffee maker it has a nice aroma i take mine with cream and sugar , and mrs b drinks hers black we both thought it was smooth , with no bitterness later it made a nice after dinner coffee when we added our favorite liquor tho i am no coffee snob , i can tell a good cup of coffee from a bad one , and this one makes the grade . 
the best sugar substitute at this time swerve is virtually replacing sugar in our home bakes and measures the same as sugar with no aftertaste ca n't wait for it to go mainstream to be able to buy in our supermarkets . 
this crackers are so good they have very little calories , very little fat and still they are crunchy and creamy i'm on a diet right now and these really help me on my craving moments depending on my caving i can eat them plain or with turkey or a spread my kids and their friends love them too and eat them with cream cheese which makes a very healthy snack buying them on amazon was a great idea because they cost less , they are fresher than in stores and i do n't even have to go to the store to get them . 
no long , frightening lists of chemical additives , either nice to find something quick and easy that i do n't have to feel guilty giving my kids from time to time i have no problem paying a little bit of a premium for annie 's , it 's well worth it br br oh , and for anyone who is getting lumps , take the package directions at face value and mix the cheese separately , then add the pasta . 
so far , i 've only had time to make waffles with this new gf bisquick , but they were delicious sometimes with gluten free products , you have to use other weird ingredients , or processes to make them these waffles were super fast , easy , and seriously delicious ca n't wait to make other things ! . 
i like my coffee strong this is the first brand that i have tasted that provides the kick i need without the bitterness i keep my pantry stocked with mahogony and i do not share ! . 
you ca n't beat the price and taste of this coffee it will always be my first choice to buy my husband brought it home one day because he liked the price and thought the the can looked neat little did we know it would become our new favorite . 
the pop chips are great i had heard they were really good and i totally agree i love being able to have all the flavors i like the variety br the chips were delivered quickly and safely . 
i reviewed werther 's original chewy caramels , caramel chocolates , and creamy filled br hard caramels as a bzzagent and found the chewy caramels came a close second to the br original hard candies still has that great unique caramel flavor from werther 's but br now in a chewable form i prefer the original hard candy as those little gems last br a little longer but these are a nice second choice . 
this coffee is good i have tried a lot of hazelnut coffees and this is one of the best i got from amazon it has a darker and richer flavor than most hazelnut coffee it was fresh and tasty and the price was great at about 6 per pound with subscribe and save i will order it again . 
the chips are very good and serve as a great snack with very low calories and weight watcher point value . 
we like this brownie mix and i usually use the low fat recipe on it i also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit dry br br we still buy this by the case . 
prior to switching to newman 's own organics dog food , my 4 year old shih tzu was crunching on iams which was fine , except that every 2 3 months or so he 'd have stomach problems after switching , his poops have been firmer , no stomach issues in sight , and his coat has gotten glossier \( and much less flaky \) duncan likes his new food and so do i ! . 
i am impressed with mr puck 's different blends , this one is a favorite of ours it lives up to the medium roast name , full bodied , not acidic and smells great while brewing , will buy again . 
the aroma is awesome ! ! love the flavor , really gets you going in the morning prompt delivery , this is definatly my husbands favorite single cup coffee . 
i'm not a huge fan of salt , so take that warning with a grain of , well you know for most people the salt on these is probably fine they stay crispy over long periods of storage , even after the package has been opened and split into tupperware containers , they 're reasonably sturdy , they pair well with all but the saltiest cheeses \( would n't put blues on them \) , they pair great with unsalted pb just a great all around cracker to keep in the house they 've become a staple of my diet and , unlike every other cracker i 've bought in bulk , and there have been many , they have n't developed some weird off flavor due to over familiarization or the cracker becoming stale they still taste good , like a simple cracker i 'll be ordering them again ! . 
so this stuff is a must have for making true pizza napoletana i'm really thrilled that it is so accessible here in the usa this flour makes the most silky smooth dough i 've ever had the pleasure of getting sticky with , and it has a different \( better for pizza \) taste than the all purpose store brand flour sure it costs a little more , it 's coming from italy , but given that you can make about 6 pizzas per bag who 's counting \? get this stuff , some d o p tomatoes , grow some basil , and make some mozarella \( okay , i admit , have n't done this one yet \) but given the first couple items there and you 're well on your way to the origins of pizza in naples , italy is it worth it \? \? \? i say si ! ! ! mangia ! ! ! \( and taylor 's market always comes through for my home shipments ! cheers ! \) . 
i was really impressed with this coffee , it has a nice bold taste , yet a smooth br finish i would order this coffee again . 
these chips are delicious if you like salt pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch , then you ca n't go wrong with these they are the tastiest bag i 've come across the sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt , in fact i have trouble cutting myself off mid bag even though i normally enjoy a low sodium diet i would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8 9oz bags . 
great service and delivery for a really good product i am constantly looking for a good hazelnut coffee and so far this is the best , along with green mountain . 
i like these chips a lot ! now i have a whole 24 pack ! this is how i get my chips on while i fish ! .
