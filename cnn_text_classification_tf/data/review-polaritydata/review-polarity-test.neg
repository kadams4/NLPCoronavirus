these are definitely not worth close to a dollar a piece if they were at my local grocery , i might give twenty to thirty cents per can for them i did n't really like the flavor that well , but if you did , they might even worth up to fifty cents per can otherwise , pass these up . 
fondarific usually has glowing reviews everyone on the cake forums seems to love it my batch was either old or just crap very disappointing will go back to making marshmallow fondant cheaper and way easier to work with also bought the black but did n't open it because the white was such crap had to use it because i ran out of time to make mmf for the cake i was making due to the fact that i pre purchased fondant to use br br i love working with fondant , and thought that maybe i 'd use something easier this time , but it was n't good luck with this br br taste however , was quite good . 
i think i liked a similar drink but this one is just there it 's bubbly it 's sort of orange flavored it has a sharpness but there 's nothing about it that excites me it 's a good old fashioned carbonated beverage and if it 's inexpensive buy it if it 's significantly more expensive than most drinks , leave it buy coke instead . 
i bought these chips thinking that they are all natural per their description of no preservatives , no artificial flavors or colors when i received them i checked the ingredients , and they contain yeast extract , which is synonymous with msg \( yeast extract contains processed free glutamic acid \) i will never purchase this product again . 
switch is a tangy drink that 's more reminiscent of sprite than orange juice it 's carbonated all the way and you will even burp after it as you would 've after consuming any soft drink the drink does n't feel sugary , but a quick glance at the nutritional facts reveals that each can contains 34 grams of sugar the claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added , so i'm assuming that 's the sugar from the orange and tangerine the can . 
this slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpet ! br br she devours the felidae platinum , \( which we feed as an occasional alternative to newman 's own turkey \) she was raised on felidae dry , so i can say that generally the canidae company provides quality products except for this grain free slop you can find the good stuff at a href http www amazon com gp product b000wfl09s felidae canned cat food for senior and overweight cats , platinum diet formula \( pack of 12 13 ounce cans \) a br br absolutely do not order this slop from amazon because they will charge you 10 70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat before you make the same stupid mistake i did , buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first then , when your cat pukes this slop back up , you will only be out 1 59 instead of the 27 94 amazon nailed me br br in my opinion , your cat and you will be much better off with newman 's own organic cat food , especially the turkey and chicken the newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death ! after we listened to our former vet and fed her science diet k d , she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month we switched her back to newman 's own turkey and within one 24 case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6 2lbs , and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months she also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the k d i read somewhere that science diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products nice br br just say no to science diet and felidae grain free formula here 's the good stuff a href http www amazon com gp product b000vk8hj0 newman 's own organics turkey vegetable formula for cats , 5 5 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a br br \( did they really want me to post a video with this review \? would you \? then its unanimous , this review will remain video free ! \) . 
first , let me say that i prefer extra bold k cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend , and never decaf i bought three wolfgang puck coffees several months ago rodeo drive blend french roast and sumatra kopi raya all three are quite drinkable , though they do not measure up to a few of the extra bold blends from coffee people kona blend organic blend jet fuel and black tiger even better than these , though , is my new favorite , a href http www amazon com gp product b003m7ttyg green mountain 's revv a those who prefer a strong , dark cup of coffee \( even at the larger mug setting \) should try that brand br br previously , i had found the dark roast green mountain coffees rather boring , but revv lives up to the hype , both in strength and flavor another great green mountain coffee is their espresso blend \( though amazon does n't stock it , so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick and mortar stores such as bed bath and beyond \) finally , a favorite regular over the years has been a href http www amazon com gp product b004m5w7yq emeril 's big easy bold a it 's a very nice coffee , though do n't expect the new orleans experience of chicory flavor br br bottom line you wo n't go wrong with the wolfgang puck coffees , but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees . 
taste nothing like how cocoa should taste , i 'll never touch this again , i 'll be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck . 
i was very excited to recieve my shipment today then to be disapppointed because 2 of the flavors that i was told would be in the package were not there ! i really wanted to try creme brulee and raspberry chocolate truffle ! i am looking forward to trying the others but had i know i would not receive these flavors i would not have ordered this product ! i also did not recieve the pink ribbon flavor ! . 
i was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original k cups , but was very disappointed in the product though the cups came with no instructions , it was apparent that you just put the filter in , add coffee , then pop the lid on trouble is , the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup , but when doing that i found it impossible to seal the cups so i had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid after doing that and trying , the coffee ran very slow though the k cup and after only about three cups , the keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working i cleaned out with vinegar and tried again , but same result i ended up throwing these away as it did n't seem worth the effort to return them not a good product ! . 
switch orange tangerine is billed as the natural alternative to sodas and or artificially sweetened juice drinks however , i found it to be pretty ordinary br br first the good stuff it is 100 orange tangerine juice , has no sweetners , is 100 natural , has 100 of your daily allowance of vitamin c , and has a nice carbonation tang to it if you are health conscious and want to drink something like a soda w o actually drinking a soda , this would probably be right down your alley br br however , i found the taste to be somewhat odd i could definitely taste the tangerine in it mixed with the orange , but the combination of the two or the bottling or something gives this switch a taste akin to eating an orange that is almost too ripe you know that kind of fermented taste of an orange that you need to eat now because by tomorrow you 'll need to put out for the birds \? not exactly something that i 'd look forward to drinking br br so for me , although this was somewhat good , its not exactly something i would get again i'm not really a health nut so if i wanted an orange soda , i 'd just go out and get an orange crush . 
my little lhasa apso mix was diagnosed with diabetes a couple of months ago , so i found merrick 's grammy 's pot pie to be low glycemic , and decided to try it he loves this food ! it has chunks of potatoes , carrots , and peas , not to mention chicken and apples the only downside about ordering it from amazon is the delivery method the day the food was delivered , a van pulled up in front of my house and left the 5 cases of food i had ordered outside of my chain link fence next to the mailbox needless to say , someone could have taken it if i had n't seen the delivery woman drop it off i'm also disabled , and if it had n't been for my next door neighbor being outside at the time , i could n't have gotten the cases of food into my house without her help many of the cans were also extremely dented delivering items this way is not acceptable i would have given this review 5 stars if it had n't been for the delivery . 
i really love this coffee , great tasting and bold however , on about 1 3rd of the pods , the foil separates from the cup and blows grounds into the brewer and my coffee cup i can usually predict which ones will do it because the foil on the k cup is not puffy like it has pressure , but flat and wrinkled . 
medaglia d'oro has to be the worst coffee i 've ever had it had an old musty flavor and odor you get what pay for . 
my kids love these , and we 've ordered them often but as was the case with at least one other reviewer , this batch came in with some mold \( i freeze them as soon as they arrive , so had the have been moldy upon arrival \) br br too bad but at this price , wo n't run the risk of having to toss out product . 
i took one and said good russet potato chip but i found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste , a bit oily and overcooked it may be because i am use to eating their great tasting a href http www amazon com gp product b000g6q4gm kettle chips spicy thai , 2 ounce bags \( pack of 24 \) a or perhaps because all the chips in the bags i received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning it is obvious the chips are flavored , but if i did not read the bag i would never have thought it had cheddar flavor and i love new york cheddar the flavoring included parmesan , cheddar , blue cheese , garlic and other spices a good chip even when overcooked , but i do not plan to buy them again . 
we switched from the advance similac to the organic product thinking it would be better as we prefer organic foods ourselves it was a disaster with our 2 month old baby getting constipated and progressively worsening her intake till she fell drastically below her calorie intake we discontinued the product within five days and switched back to the previous similac and she is fine now her feeding and calorie intake is back to normal . 
the can says it 's 100 juice , but the taste is powdery if you 've ever had a glass of kool aid or crystal light , you 'll know what i mean br br so there 's that 'from powder' taste also there is an aftertaste and all comes in a can the size of a red bull for 160 calories br br i did not like it . 
duncan hines used to be my favorite line of cake mixes i bought them all of the time but now they , like betty crocker , have downsized their packages of cake mix these new mixes will not work with older recipes , that called for the 18 25 ounce size of cake mix that rules out a lot of our favorite cakes even a plain cake will be changed it wo n't bake up as high or as big in the pan duncan hines just lost me as a customer br br pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes \( at least , not yet \) i will be buying them if they shrink in size , i will bake from scratch . 
very good tasteing product but i need to use it the smallist setting on my b 60 to really enjoy the depth . 
miss vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available i'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and miss vickie 's are better imho . 
i bought this because it 's organic cheese puff my son love gerber cheese lil' crunchies i thought he may like this too i subscribe it once a month now there is 4 cans not open the idea of mixing cheese and carrot is great , but there is no taste for this cheese snack there is no cheese flavor in the puff my son opened the can and keeps giving the puff to me my son love happybaby 's yogurt melts , beef stew , happy baby banana beet blueberry and spinach , mango and pear this cheese puff does not work for him . 
this food variety is ground , thus my cat does n't care that much for this variety but , he liked the taste of it a lot so i have been buying it off and on throughout the years my previous cat really liked it so i 've purchased quite a few of these it 's got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares \? if your cat likes ground , give this one a try for sure . 
did n't realize it was flavored and thought , when i had my first sip , that it tasted like chemicals f gave it away the next day at work . 
i have mixed feelings about nunaturals nustevia white stevia with maltodextrin powder and will probably not purchase it again do n't get me wrong , it 's a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use , but it is just 6 4 percent stevia and 93 6 percent maltodextrin filler in other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder in my opinion , this is unnecessarily dilute however , it does make it exceptionally easy to measure if the labeling said 6 4 stevia extract , i would have passed on this from the beginning as i can get 70 dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia if this is your first time buying stevia , go for it as it 's easy to use and tastes great if you 're accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts , you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this product 's mixture br br pros br 5 star taste br easy to measure br perfect for first time stevia users br 3 4 tsp 1 tbsp cane sugar br br cons br only 6 4 stevia br not cost competitive with 70 or pure dry stevia extracts br 3 4 tsp 1 tbsp cane sugar br br overall , a good product but not the best value i would given it 4 stars if the product labeling did n't try to hide the fact that it 's just not very potent for about 1 3 to 1 2 the cost of this product , you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead \( or just use them full strength , which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia \) br br in case you 're wondering where i got the 6 4 \( by mass \) value from , this is how i calculated it on a precise scale , i found the density of this product to be 2 5 grams per teaspoon the label says it contains 40mg per 1 4 tsp thus , 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder the concentration \( mass \) comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6 4 percent by weight pretty weak stuff , but still much sweeter than cane sugar . 
a hot chocolate packet was the first k cup on my new keurig \( it was 1 a m and i was n't ready for coffee before bed \) i had read they ran a little watery but i decided to try it on the 10 oz setting , took a sip , and tossed it the next morning i made one with 8 oz and added some whipped cream the taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery my husband made one to try at 6 oz and said it tasted like sugar water i might try combining 2 3 6 oz servings to use the box up but we wo n't be buying more . 
the cookies came sealed and seem to be high quality in there ingredients the only thing is they just do n't taste that good my girlfriend and i thought these might be a good dessert like option while doing the paleo diet , but after trying one of each kind over a couple days we just do n't find ourselves going back for more i would much rather not have a dessert and really check that box on a cheat day than being left wanting more after eating these if you have a true gluten allergy , maybe this is a good option for you but i'm not a believer . 
the picture and description was pure butter mini shortbread round , then i decided to order it because i love them so bad but when i got the package , it came out at mini chocolate chip shortbread which i do n't like . 
so anyways , i wished that i could find ginseng tea more easier , but for the price excluding the shipping i suppose its allright comes in a weird form , not powder kinda like small bits of grass taste fine not sour or sweet . 
i do n't know why this got such good reviews but my yorkshire really does n't like it he likes iams more than this and it 's cheaper . 
i love the product but , the bottle design is terrible in order to get the last 1 3 or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down with the pointy top that is impossible so , you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out this takes much more time that you 'll want it to take redesign the bottle with a flat top please . 
i was thinking of purchasing these oakcakes however , in reading the ingredients , i do n't see oats listed are these oakcakes without oats \? br br wheat flour , vegetable oils , sugar , wheat bran , invert sugar syrups , salt , skimmed milk powder , raising agent . 
these are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety , which can be hard to find br br one thing to keep in mind though , is the expiration or best by date for example , if you order these in april and the batch you receive has a june use by date , it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you since they 're roasted in oil and unsalted , these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety , even if refrigerated upon receipt br br amazon does n't seem to specify use by dates for the food products they sell , so it 's a gamble for the purchaser i'm assuming that amazon wo n't ship stuff that has expired , but they probably ship out the oldest stock first , and the use by date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice . 
tastes very good i really like the taste br br but then it is gone like it was never there so fleeting br br takes two pieces to really enjoy , also br br and be very careful not to eat it seriously , it is hard not to swallow it laugh all you want you try it and see what i mean . 
something to eat if you're starving but please give real food to hungry people , br br what 's in kellogg 's corn flakes \? milled corn , sugar , malt flavoring , high fructose corn syrup , salt yes , of course , it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as bht and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities for nutrition you get basically 100 carbs from lots of sugar and almost no protein add skim milk , or you 'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk for added nutrition , include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ br br if you like corn flakes , that is your business and you should enjoy them , but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0 29 cents an ounce 3 49 per package at this price , the inner package 's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff why not use a vacuum sealed container like kretschmer 's wheat germ to preserve freshness \? after all , it 's in the same price range ! br br so if you are hungry , you are really eating the wrong stuff something to eat if you are starving but please give real food to other hungry people please ! . 
i have never received anything like this from amazon before the product was packed in an old used golf ball box \( bizarre \) the cans were all dented and old looking the bowls were chipped up i thought , oh well , maybe the soup will taste good wrong ! three different flavors but they were all awful , completely inedible all of them were horribly fishy and metallic tasting , the worst canned soups i have ever tasted in my life poured them all out and donated the chipped bowls to charity complete waste of money . 
i thought this coffee was really horrible had one cup and will throw the rest away because it ca n't be returned . 
consumer reports rated these crackers the highest in inorganic arsenic of all the rice crackers on the market i like these crackers , but will no longer eat them until the arsenic issue in brown rice is resolved . 
the grains make this food really flakey it just does n't stick together and was falling off the spoon a major mess really it also does n't have a zip lock top and i thought it did like many of the other pouch foods and took this with us out to dinner i ended up putting the leftovers in a plastic baggie my baby also was not a fan of this at all and she is not a picky eater even my dogs turned their nose up at it and i thought it tasted pretty nasty . 
and the expiration date on top of the can says jan 06 , 05 i cannot even return it since it is a grocery amazon , are you serious \? . 
i was expecting something more considering the keurig does such a good job with coffee br but this stuff \? everybody who sampled it here said it tasted just like nestle 's powdered hot chocolate in a mug with hot water watery , sugary , and nothing special . 
found my kids actually cutting open the pods and dumping them into a cup to add hot water too they complained that lots of the good stuff stays in the pod kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging , so we switched back to packets . 
i bought my mberry pack from mberry us online hoping to use it to curb my sweet tooth i followed the directions to the letter , allowing the tablet to dissolve completely on my tongue i then tried balsalmic vinegar nothing happened to the taste at all except that my tongue burned a little so i tried hot sauce nothing happened again except that my tongue burned a lot then i tried regular vinegar nothing happened again i even tried taking a second tablet , but it still did nothing but slightly burn my tongue huge waste of money super disappointing does not work ! . 
bought uncle ray 's wavy 's 16 oz potato chips because purchased uncle ray 's 16 oz barbque potato chips in the past and was very pleased oh how wrong we were do not purchase the wavy 's chips ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! they are the quality of buying a no name bag of chips from a roadside service station store broken , brown , very poor quality very , very disappointed do not do not do not purchase uncle ray 's 16 oz wavy potato chips br br october 03 , 2012 br br bought uncle ray 's sour cream and onion flavored chips for the 5th shipment with extreme disappointment the other \( 4 \) four shipments were very good which is why we continued to buy this flavor br br the additive that when you like an item and start to buy a lot , it will change for the worse is proving to be true for us this shipment of chips are awful bags are extremely deflated , so was expecting to be stale however , was not so cannot not explain the semi flat bags chips seem to be the bottom of the barrel flakes you know when you try to salt your food and the top comes off , the seasoning on these chips is like that it appears that the top came off a full bottle or these are the bottom of the barrel crumbled chips where the seasoning has covered the chips too , too much we just opened \( 3 \) three bags just now because the first bags was awful , opened second bag awful , opened 3rd bag also was awful left with 6 more , probably not edible , bags the chips really appear to be the not so fresh , burned bottom of the barrel , get rid of leftovers very , very , disappointed will not buy again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . 
i purchased these because they do not contain dairy , soy or corn well , in addition to being dairy free , soy free they are flavor free ! absolutely horrible dry tasting bars first words out of my mouth were tastes like dirt so that 's what i'm going with do not waste your money . 
i thought this was a great buy , but as noted by scott d , the molasses content was not up to par i loved the higher molasses content sugar in the raw unfortunately what i purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and i have twelve 24 ounce bags i guess i 'll watch for the next crop . 
claxton dark fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950 's i ordered it directly from the company this year and when i served it at thanksgiving , my guests and i thought i must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell claxton fruitcakes it was at best 40 fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored cake i emailed the company and expressed my disappointment after several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners , they assured me that it was the original dark recipe br br in reading the ingredients , i noticed that corn syrup , sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient at the very end were listed molasses , spices and 3 artificial food dyes high fructose corn syrup was n't widely available until the mid 1970 's to mid 1980 's , so i'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients br br all of the people i talked to seemed to have the attitude that i was so stupid that i could n't possibly be observing what i had correctly although they offered to send replacements if i returned it at my own expense , they told me that what i would receive would be identical to what i have one of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year br br i am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition , but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash . 
in the attempt to make blueberry cake for my brother , i used the whole bottle and still did n't have a blueberry cake i added about half the bottle to the cake mix \( white cake not vanilla \) , and the other half to the frosting \( white frosting not vanilla \) and it still only had a hint of blueberry flavor i was completely disappointed in all the time , effort and money spent making it , and it barely tasted blueberry i would have thought that using the whole bottle would have made a blueberry flavor i guess i will have to see if i can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry flavored extract will not be wasting my money on this again \( . 
i like the idea of a healthy soda type drink , but this flavor just missed the mark the tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth carbonated juice is a great idea , they just need to tweak the flavors a bit br br ranking the switch drinks from best to worst br br 1 watermelon strawberry br 2 kiwi berry br 3 black cherry br 4 orange tangerine . 
after reading reviews and testing these out with friends , i can say this everyone 's tastes \( and tastebuds \) are different what is not sweet to one person is super sweet to another so be ye warned , results for these may vary br br i found that the tablets did n't make things sweet as much it cut down on the sourness , almost like a numbing effect ever put sugar on a lemon slice and bit into it \? the sour kick is still there , just canceled out i'm certainly not going to be eating them like candy as some reviews suggest br br tried out a few beer types , with mixed results beers that are fruity citrus ended up gross , as it would taste like i mixed in a mouthful of juice with the beer dark beers like an irish red were my favorite br br i really recommend going out to eat so you can try a variety of things certain foods will take you for surprise \( ranch dressing , for example , was notably different and very good \) . 
while the flavor and quality of this chili is great , the 108 ounce can is mostly liquid the number of servings is listed as 12 , but the reality is that it will only serve about 5 , unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated i wo n't be purchasing this again . 
like the majority of other meals in the hormel line , this one is excessively salty that alone is tolerable though if only the meal was n't swimming in sauce this ends up being more like a soup than a rice meal which is an utter shame because everything else is fairly nice and the enormous amount of sauce ruins it br br but it 's very quick and easy to make and fills you up so even a blah meal like this fits the bill it 's not my favorite of this type of meals but i would n't turn it down for lunch one hungry afternoon . 
my dog loves this food i really like that it is organic , especially with all the recent problems with other dog foods i will continue to buy this brand in the store i would rate the product as a 5 br br the problem i had was with subscribe and save i started out buying at a very decent price after only 2 months the subscription price had increased by almost 40 ! ! no notice on the increase was sent to see if i still wanted it either i believe amazon should send an alert and ask to confirm or cancel when there is an increase my other subscriptions have not had price increases like this one subscription rating 1 . 
the aroma of a href http www amazon com gp product b002tmv3e4 melitta cafe collection riviera sunset decaffeinated ground coffee , 10 ounce bags \) a was fairly weak scent , after all , is a huge part of taste , and this was disappointing br br even though i added more coffee grinds than the directions instructed , i found the coffee to be a bit bland the taste was more than flavored water , but not amazingly so , with no subtle overtones it was n't bitter , but it was n't much of anything br br while i generally drink hi test as opposed to decaffeinated , i do drink decaf at least twice a week the a href http www amazon com gp product b002tmv3e4 melitta a was comparable to the generic brand that i usually have br br a href http www amazon com gp product b002tmv3e4 melitta cafe collection riviera sunset decaf a is n't a bad coffee , but it 's not worth the money if there are other options available . 
i ordered this from amazon and they were pure liquid like water i did not feel at all comfortable feeding them to my daughter amazon customer service , however , was awesome and gave me a full refund . 
i love juice and i love carbonated beverages , but it is difficult to see this product having a long retail life br br essentially , this is a good drink that does n't really do anything well br br it does n't taste good enough to be a juice replacement and is there really a need for a juice replacement \? it might have limited value in camping situations or during other times where small cans make better travelers br br it 's not exactly a post workout recovery drink juice would be better minute maid juice , for instance , has less sugar and carbohydrates , even though switch does n't add any sugar and there are plenty of other juices that have more nutrients , including calcium and other vitamins and supplements , including potassium so , it 's less healthy than most juices br br switch is n't exactly a diet soda because of the natural sugar content comapared to zero sugar in diet drinks br br as a regular alternative to sugared soda , it tastes good , but there is nothing really to distinguish it from other fruit based sodas and , 22 a case , it 's more than twice as expensive of sodas that come in bigger cans br br so , in the end , switch is worth a try but likely not something you will habitually buy . 
i 've suffered from recurrent bouts of acute sinusitis that have only become worse and worse over the years every time i get an infection , my right maxillary sinus swells up like a balloon sleeping at night on account of this condition is terribly difficult i often have to resort to using afrin to decongest my sinuses , which is effective but also very painful and not a realistic , long term solution because of rebound congestion now i already irrigate with a motorized system , often upwards of 8 10x daily when i'm sick , and drinking herbal tea has also become a pasttime to help cope with my sinus disease that being said , i bought this tea out of sheer desperation i 'll try \( and have tried \) next to anything to give myself some relief while i wait for antibiotics to take effect the only thing which i find works even close to as well as afrin is to megadose on psuedoephedrine \( 240 1 2 times per day \) , which is something that is also unsustainable so , keep in mind that the severity of my sinus condition is drastic what i found with this tea is that it seems to help , but i ca n't tell whether or not it works any better than domestic teas that tout similar claims \( yogi 's breathe deep and cold buster , celestial sleepytime sinus soother , and other respiratory aiding herbal formulations \) i 've brewed it double strong to try and gain the greatest effect , and again , it seems to work modestly but nothing amazing the taste is a little bitter , but i suppose that 's a fairly reasonable indicator it has beneficial compounds in it all in all , i am likely to stick with the less exotic teas that i can buy at the grocery store as an aside , i find celestial 's sweet and spicy herbal mix to have probably the best mucus thinning effect out of all the teas i 've tried , though it 's not at all marketed as something for this purpose if you read everything they put in it , though , it makes sense that it would help . 
i was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is it has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak . 
looked like a good deal , so i ordered the ground fennel , as well as 4 other spices and seasonings from this company , but was disappointed with them all zero flavor , not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when loosely sealed containers were opened the dill smelled like dried musty grass , and the onion even worse ended up throwing them all away save your money , do not buy this product . 
i'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that truffle oil is receiving on amazon ! those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny 17 bottles of truffle oil are made in a laboratory there 's not a molecule of actual truffle in them it 's a sinful shame that 's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening new york times article called hocus pocus , and a beaker of truffles read it and weep br br and if you see truffle oil advertised on the menu somewhere , you might ask if they 're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes . 
the product description says that it 's just juice , bubbles and vitamin c really , it 's just the last two it 's not entirely flavorless , but i 've tasted plenty of beverages that are much better than this one with a lot less carbonation br br and , honestly , this healthy drink is rather easily replaced by a multivitamin pill it 's not really good for you , it 's just not directly bad for you sincerely , i'm fairly sure that sucking on my couch cushions would garner you more nutrition than a mountain dew , so it 's not like better than soda is really setting the bar high br br rather disappointing , particularly compared to the other switch beverages . 
honestly the first time i tried jamaica me crazy i had to double check to make sure that i did n't leave the pod irom my last cup n the coffee maker weak coffee , flavor did n't appeal to me either might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side wolfgang 's vienna roast was pleasant though . 
purchased three pounds arrived well packaged am trying to find a replacement roaster of this blend this is good , but not great we 'll keep on looking . 
i just received these bricks today and was very disappointed to find that both of the bricks were broken and unusable as a serving cooking plate they were busted completed in half they were packaged in one sleeve of small bubble wrap in a shallow box with no other protection or packaging in the box i went online to try and return them and they are not eligible for return this is the first return i 've ever tried to do in over 7 years of purchasing items off of amazon \( to the tune of several orders a month ! \) and yet the one time that i want to return a defective product , i ca n't do it i will be much more careful about what is eligible for returns and what is n't in the future . 
just awful ! i thought food was supposed to taste good ! i had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth , it 's that bad . 
i was given a track number and told it was delivered to my pobox it never happened i received a refund and am now in the process of wating for my new reorder . 
first of all , when i opened my bag of melitta decaf , it did n't have that strong , amazing rich coffee smell that my usual coffee has i brewed up a pot in my drip coffeemaker , and while it was ok , there was nothing outstanding about the taste it was bland and unremarkable compared to the coffee i normally drink . 
my kids love these fruit roll ups and i remember having them as a child so i was delighted when i saw i could buy a large box however , when they came we were disappointed ! the were were very old and hard we only opened one and it broke into pieces because it 's a food item , you ca n't return which i think is ridiculous we could n't even eat them ! i order lots of stuff from amazon and have had a great experience except for these fruit roll ups do n't buy food from amazon ! \( the only reason i gave it 1 star is because i had to click on something and they did arrive on time \) . 
the coffee was not stale as some have had , but the roast is too dark for a bean such as this i believe a better product could be had with the same beans . 
this tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and does n't taste very chocolatey the name brand cocoa kkups are better , or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better . 
i thought this coffee was really horrible had one cup and will throw the rest away because it ca n't be returned . 
the good br br walker shortbread cookies are my favorite , i love them i bought the highlanders and each set of cookies came individually wrapped with two cookies each if this were the end of it , a five star review br br the bad br br unfortunately , amazon shipped them in a box that was about the same size as the container they came in from the walkers cookie company after ups was through with the shipment , my cookies were reduced to crumbs i contacted amazon about this problem without ever receiving a response since i bought these shipped and sold by amazon , i wo n't be purchasing these cookies from amazon again . 
this coffee is inoffensive , but not strong enough for my tastes i do use cream , and i'm sure that makes a difference . 
i have to admit , i was a sucker for the large quantity , 12 oz , when shopping for hot sauces but now seeing the size of the bottle , it reminds of wing sauce bottle sizes plastic bottle it does have a convenient squirt top but overall , not very hot or tasty , and made mostly from jalape ntilde os if i had seen the ingredients list i would not have bought it br jalapenos br water br vinegar br brown sugar br lime juice br fish sauce br cilantro br habanero br garlic br spice blend br salt br potassium sorbate br xanthan gum . 
these are a good alternative to candy , but still a lot of sugar in a better form br sharkies energy sports chews are not quite so sweet but are healthier becasue the man ingredient is brown rice syrup which is a complex carbohydrate with low glycemic index being very hypogylcemic brown rice syrup and agave nectar are the only two natural sweetners that do n't cause a sugar crash so for this reason the stingers only get 3 stars and sharkies get 5 ! if you want sweeter in sharkies get the kids version , but they are like stingers no brown rice syrup oh , the brown rice version fill me up faster because they are a complex carbohydrate and do n't cause blood sugar fluctuations . 
of all the k cup flavors that are out there , and there are many very good ones , this is one of my least favorites , and i have tried almost all of them not much flavor to this one , even if you add various types of creamers of course , it is all a matter of taste , but this one does n't taste all that good it is not bad it is just kind of there like a generic coffee try something else instead . 
switch markets itself as an alternative to soda it is essentially carbonated fruit juice with no added sweeteners i do agree that if you are a person who drinks a lot of soda or have child who does , switching to his would be the better alternative br but this drink is not healthy by any means , the amount of fruit juice required for it 's tastiness results in a high sugar and calorie content for a fruit juice you would not want to drink 5 of these in a day and the better option would be a piece of fruit with less calories and sugar . 
if keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular k cup , keurig would be out of business wolfgang puck french roast melange francais is inexcusably terrible coffee aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old kwiki mart carafe mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating the after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth i simply could n't believe my keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee , so i tried again a week later with same results i use average to good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like green mountain , tulleys , nor emeril 's everyone i know that has a keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup usually the results are stunning , and the keurig invasion lives on when i share i 'll stick with offering the coffee peoples' black tiger or jet fuel now i have 22 more wp fr k cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of let me know if you want them , as i 'd be embarrassed to even give them away sorry wolfgang , but what the puck your french roast is unpardonably horrible , and at k cup prices i 'll not be duped again i 'll stay away from any of the other wp offerings . 
these have an artificial sweetener aftertaste not pleasant i would not purchase them again this the first kcup hot chocolate i 've tried , i 'll keep looking . 
this is a great price , but every time i 've bought these through amazon , the bottles frequently have dark stuff on the threads of the bottle when you open it i 've never seen this when buying them from the local drugstore , so i worry that these are either old or maybe not authentic \? br br ca n't say for sure of course they do have the desired effect , so i'm not complaining too much it 's kind of gross sometimes though . 
this product is made by annie 's inc in berkely , ca made in the usa the product maintains excellent organic integrity , and it is stored in 100 recycled paperboard packaging br br the manufacturers also support family farms use organic milk , butter , and yogurt the product takes approximately 10 min to prepare the product contains dairy and wheat , and it has been exposed to equipment that also processes egg and soy products br br the ingredients include organic whole wheat shell pasta , organic valley organic cheddar cheese \( organic cultured pasteurized milk , salt , non animal enzymes \) , organic whey , salt , and sodium phosphate br br this is a mildly flavored whole wheat macaroni cheese dinner this mac and cheese is a wonderful comfort food the pasta is firm , and it has an excellent flavor br br there are no artificial flavors , synthetics colors , or preservatives the pasta was produced without antibiotics , synthetic hormones , or persistent pesticides br br this pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture there are 2 5 servings per box \( 2 5 oz \) each serving contains 250 cal , 4 5 g fat , sat 2 g fat , 10 mg cholest , 570 mg sodium , 43 g carb , 5 g fiber , 6 g sugars , 9 g protein br br however , the cheese envelop is not exactly sufficient even when you add the butter , milk , or yogurt to add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese , you will have to add your own organic cheese br br the cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta i give this mac and cheese a 5 5 on packaging , 5 5 for maintain organic integrity , 5 5 on texture , and a 2 5 for flavor . 
i remembered that melitta was a very fine ground , and thought it would likely go well in my coffee maker br br but after having a bag of whole beans and grinding it myself , the melitta came up average at best better than maxwell house though . 
as coffee , these kcups are just ok as flavored coffee these are disappointing i found the vanilla to be barely detectable . 
i was really hoping that your product would solve my discontent with the keurig coffe maker that i received for xmas i am a coffee and chicory drinker so of course i wanted to have the same great coffee thru the keurig machine the mesh filter that i bought first left a slimed residue in the brew so i believed that the paper filter you created would do the job well it does it 's work properly but it is a little large for the keurig device so water and grinds sort of go everywhere i dont think your product isnt good the whole keurig experience is a great disappointment ! . 
warning it contains food preservatives other than that it is fine , but presence of preservatives in dates \( ! \) justifies my low 2 star rating . 
earth 's best is supposed to be one of the best baby foods , but apparently my son does not have a palate for their food maybe he did not like the texture of this stuff \( it looks gritty \) he normally eats anything but was very sluggish with this food turning his head after a couple of bites . 
very disappointed , not much pumpkin or spice , just pretty close to plain old coffee i was hoping for something like they have at tim horton 's but its not even close . 
been curious about stonewall since reading all the amazon reviews but not sure about spending for a pancake mix the other day , found a big can at sur la tab store in san francisco for only 10 95 , so i thought , why not , this is my chance to try i was so looking fwd to saturday morning and made it first thing today all i can say is , underwhelming , nothing special i tried it following the instructions but using low fat milk and healthier butter , it was alright , but not great esp considering the price then i doctored it up a bit , added madagascar vanilla , flaxseed and psyllium which i usually do with my pancakes , tasted a bit better overall rating , 3 stars , just ok , stuck with the can so we 'll eat it , but will not purchase again i will probably try it next time with full fat milk and butter as it recommended to see if that makes a difference , it probably does i highly recommend garvey 's organic pancake mix , also here in amazon , tastes so much better and fluffier if you like 100 whole grain pancakes , we also love kodiak buttermilk mix , also here on amazon healthy , hearty and so good , even my kids love it and best of all it 's just add water , makes it portable , we even took it with us on vacay to hawaii . 
are these people crazy or can i not multiple properly \? this is 43 for 24 small cups of peaches that works out to 7 for the 4 pack this 4 pack cost about 3 50 in a grocery store in the states but because i'm deployed i'm suppose to pay 7 for it \? ! not happening netgrocer com is 4 00 higher than a grocercy store , but cheaper than this ! . 
i'm amazed that people are happy with this product i'm not a drinker of the dark brews , french roast or anything , but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee , this is completely tasteless the initial scent is delicious , too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee . 
i have a 6 5 month old who eats 2 food all of the time i bought this variety pack and noticed that the peach oatmeal is thick like a paste coincidentally , as i was thinking that as i was feeding him he started choking and gasping for air he could n't breathe and i had to give him the heimlich maneuver and luckily he started crying very scary and those jars went right in the garbage . 
i bought this for my husband since he loves ranch he uses ranch dressing with everything before i bought it , i read a review that said it taste good inspite of the fat free well , my husband had it and says it 's aweful i guess to each his own everyone 's tastebuds are not alike someone else may like it , so i am not going to discourage anyone from trying it however , i had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes ranch in the family , does n't like this one i guess he needs the fat \) . 
to me this coffee was extremely bitter i dumped it out and made a different cup it made me afraid to try other wp coffees but i did like the wp sumatra kopi raya br br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano br br my favorite k cups are br starbucks french roast br starbucks caffe verona br starbucks pike place roast br green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve br green mountain double black diamond br green mountain revv br green mountain dark magic br br other k cups i 've tried coffee people jet fuel , green mountain dark magic decaf , emeril jazzed up decaf , starbucks caffe verona , coffee people black tiger , starbucks house blend , starbucks breakfast blend , starbucks sumatra , wolfgang puck french roast , green mountain lake and lodge , green mountain french roast , caribou mahogony , wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya , emeril big easy bold . 
i chuckled a little when i read that this soda had no added sugar when i checked the label in the can since it already has 34gms of sugar anything more added and you 'll have sugar junkies of whoever tries the drink the soda is tasty and quite fizzy , i think it has more carbonation than fanta which goes flat easier the can is the typical size of an energy drink , but this is not an energy drink merely another fruit flavored soda it is flavored naturally , but that is the only difference from regular soda type drinks . 
i was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews , but it 's nothing special for my taste , it 's way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough \( even my kids agree \) it reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish , so if that sounds good to you , go for it but if you 're more interested in something more spicy , hot and even a little sour , you might want to keep looking . 
i love eating them and they are good for watching tv and looking at movies ! it is not too sweet i like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so i can take my time eating them . 
i love peanut satay this product is truly terrible in no way does it resemble that dish oily , salty and tastes lousy do n't waste your money on this brand . 
a 5000 00 diamond would be cheaper to ship than a 5000 00 car ! i do n't buy from any supplier that ships by price br this item is 7 95 then you pay 11 95 for up to 20 00 for shipping \? no way i would pay that for one jar . 
i love these delicious mangoes but the subscription option does n't ship at correct times i just received two shipments at once \( even packaged in the same box \) this week , when one of those shipments was supposed to be for april and i was not notified of that before they shipped and charged my card . 
i bought this tea during a major sinus infection crisis which included headache , earache , toothache i drink multiple cups over a few days , and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect taste is so so , but that 's not really what matters as every sinus sufferer knows , if eating dirt would make the pain go away , we 'd eat dirt . 
ive been craving some deer jerky for a while so i gave this one and some others on amazon a try this one was very sinue and a little too sweet for my taste not going to buy again im still on my search for the salty dry version im after . 
i bought a bottle of tapatio hot sauce for my friend to have it shipped over to her in the east coast the order said it 'd take 5 business days it ended up taking over 3 weeks . 
i tried a double boxes of this when the donut shop coffee i usually order was unavailable while the coffee is pretty good the cups suck a full 1 3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable they are slow to brew \( coffee maker has to work very hard \) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed they could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee i believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable . 
when the flowers showed up , they were in pretty bad shape i figured that water and the provided plant food would spruce them up within a few days did n't happen they went from being dull and wilted to being dead within four days of arrival . 
the fresh tasting libby 's organic corn , no additives ! i ca n't believe amazon can offer such good tasting corn in a can so cheap ! but for taste and value , this ca n't be beat . 
we have been looking for natural ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule yes , we 'd probably be better served taking a yoga class , but this is a good second choice this helps you fall asleep and stay asleep i drank half the first night and that was plenty for me after about 30 minutes , i was ready for bed ! i woke up refreshed and with no sleepy drug hangover , so that is a huge bonus br br i gave the product 3 stars \( instead of the 5 it deserves \) as their packing job was marginal at best the product arrived with 2 broken bottles , which at this price is a 6 loss ! the bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box big packing fail , but the product is awesome . 
tasteless , basically says it all i love tea drink it every day i found this undrinkable great packaging , but not a good tea for me . 
this product is simply for cheap liquor since taste and quality is not important ! i prefer to drink my grey goose straight however , on occasion it is absolutely delicious with a very tiny splash of olive juice this product was a a quick fix for me to stop purchasing olives in order to use the juice it 's not worth it ! ! the after taste is worse ! ! . 
this does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use i is just not good . 
not bad for a prepackaged and quickie meal if you 're looking for authentic thai , this will give you only half the flavor , so the name that it is only a taste of thai is quite accurate cartons are fancy , but big for the amount they hold it is definitely enough for a meal , but if you 're looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat , you had better grab two it is tasty enough for a meal , but if you can get yourself to an authentic asian supermarket , i guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price \( ie 6 boxes of noodles for 6 \) and i'm not talking about cup o' noodles or things you find at american supermarkets but overall , my husband and i , being the noodle mongers that we are , did enjoy these as something new for the palate however , we will probably opt to order thai takeout for fresh noodles next time we have a craving . 
i originally ordered two teas from art of tea the silver needles and the coconut creme when my package came in , they had shipped the coconut creme and mistakenly bundled it with this mandarin silk tea by accident i contacted amazon and they refunded the silver needles and told me i could dispose of the mandarin silk oolong as i saw fit well , since i'm never one to turn down tea , i chose to dispose of it by , well , drinking it br br this is n't a bad tea , first off i do n't have too much experience with oolongs , but i do like the flavor of this however , i do n't taste too much of the mandarin it almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea , and it has a similar light green yellow color i drink it with a little honey br br all in all , it 's a decent tea i do n't think i 'll order it again , but i 'll certainly finish off this tin . 
i bought two bags of popchips at whole foods \( original and barbeque \) and loved them when i went to amazon to order lots more , i liked the idea of single serving bags rather than the larger ones , which i 'd consume too quickly i knew i was taking a risk but when the order came , i really disliked about half of the flavors in the assortment in addition , only the original and barbeque nutritional values calculated at 2 pts the others were all 3 i still like popchips but will only buy bags of the flavors i know i will enjoy eating and not have to choke down i recommend that you try a bag of each flavor before you spring for a volume order . 
i was very happy with the quick shipping as i needed it for a school product for my daughter but when it came in the roof was broken and the corner of the house was broken i could n't send it back as i needed for a project . 
this gum is the worst i have ever purchased , plain and simple within two seconds of chewing taste gone ! . 
there was absolutly no scent or flavor to this when i brought home truffles from aosta in italy they were wonderful and cost less these were worthless . 
i ordered three of the trays \( being a date nut \) and found that two were old or stale i admit to not checking the out of date on the exterior package , but still dried out fruit \? ! the last tray was fresher , but the experience was soured at that point i'm disappointed . 
these treats are more for a larger dog as they are very hard and thick the girls \( my maltese \) like them except way too big and hard to chew for them . 
my dogs really did not care for these were not real p nutty . 
to me , this tastes more like pineapple juice than coconut there is an underlying hint of coconut , i know the water is n't strongly flavored , but i was n't expecting so much pineapple this is tangy and sweet it is alright package is smaller , but i do n't think i could handle too much more of it in one sitting i am not thrilled with their unflavored coconut water , it is too tangy sour to me , so with the pineapple it helps cover up that funkiness for me not sure i 'd buy this again still in search of the one i first tried and fell in love with , but so far not finding anything as light and fresh tasting . 
i bought this for fathers day my father loves dried fruits and nuts br br it came in a somewhat cute crate box , and each compartment was in a plastic bag that means that if you do n't eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale , as they are now sitting in the open same story for the fruit br br while all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard chewy br br i recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece , but not if you actually want to eat it . 
with a href http www amazon com gp product b00389q4xw green mountain hot cocoa a being perpetually out of stock in the winter , i thought i 'd give the cheaper grove square brand a shot br br since the k cup patents are starting to sunset , grove square is one of the first unofficial producers of we ca n't legally call these k cups but they work in your keurig \( r \) \( tm \) coffee maker pods , and i thought that i 'd be getting the same overall quality , without the licensing fees tacked on to the price br br well i was right about grove square being cheaper but i think that 's the nicest i can be br br as others have pointed out , there 's a definite diet or a href http www amazon com gp product b000e6lbxk splenda a aftertaste this had n't been reviewed yet when i bought it , so i did n't see the warnings from others , and re checked the ingredients several times to make sure br br well it 's got 60 calories , which seems a bit lower than green mountain , but a bit high for something that diet conscious people would want and the ingredient list did n't seem to point to obvious diet sweeteners br br the overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar free tootsie roll in your hot water , using the normal cup setting going one size down did n't seem to improve much , beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter but that just meant a heavier shot of low calorie sweetener to the taste buds br br the way i see it , i saved about 5 by going with this brand on the other hand , now i 've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if i ca n't sucker someone er please my discerning guests with a few cups br br if you drink diet soft drinks by choice , you 're probably going to like this . 
bought 6lbs of this popcorn based on reviews that the hulls are softer on this baby white than on regular popcorn not only are the hulls just as tough as regular popcorn , the corn pops up so tiny that it 's about 1 3 hull , 2 3 popped corn per kernel ! i was hoping to use this as a healthy snack for my kids who love popcorn but not the hulls br i popped this using every tip i could find on the internet all experiments still resulted in a tough hull . 
this is the 1st k cup coffee that i am getting grounds in my coffee it is occuring about every 3 cups i have not had this problem with other k cup manufactures i will not reorder . 
i used quotes around the word tea because i doubt that the bags contain tea i would n't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea i would not give this product a single star it deserves zero stars in my opinion br this tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star . 
i bought this because the ingredients seem to be ok but for some reason it made my dogs have to go outside at least 3 times each night , overnight for the 2 weeks we gave this to them we changed back to origen , a food they do well on and the middle of the night bathroom trips stopped in 2 days also , my older dog tends to get really diggy when she is eating something not good for her and with this food she was constantly digging at the couch ! i have no idea what is wrong with this food , none of the ingredients stand out to me as being the cause but something in it really messed my puggies up ! . 
overpriced beans , they are packed in a glass tube that is not air tight br br the beans were thin and almost dry br br get the cheaper options at amazon instead , they are much better and way cheaper . 
this is n't as easy as it looks , does n't came with enough yellow frosting , and the frosting does n't stick very well my 5 year old did like making it though . 
i 've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning keeps you from eating too many ! occasionally i get really stale items from amazon com and this was one unedible beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case , not expired but stale and unedible just the same . 
the oatmeal inside the canisters was good however , the packaging by amazon was terrible every single can arrived dented , and several of the cans popped open amazon treats products terribly i have n't ordered from amazon in a long time , not since they sent me expired pirate 's booty , which i tossed i thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try what a mistake never again customer service at amazon leaves much to be desired , as well if you get someone , they 'll probably speak broken english and be very hard to understand then they will not understand the problem you 'll have to ask for a supervisor who , you hope , will speak better english be prepared to wait a long time for a supervisor , and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor the supervisor will ask for every piece of identification imaginable , not short of your ssn , before saying , well , what do you want me to do \? uh , you 're customer service service the customer \? \? \? amazon has lost my business forever . 
i tried this carrot juice for the first time today and regret buying it i took my first sip and actually wondered if someone had put pickle juice in the jar it was awful i 've had several carrot juices and never had any as sour as this it is difficult to fathom how this product is still produced it has lemon juice in it , but apparently far far too much if you enjoy pickle juice with your carrot juice , you will love this product i do n't . 
although this coffee tastes fine there is nowhere enough coffee in the pod the cup that is brewed even with a smaller amount of water is weak and watery . 
i might be mistaken , but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size if they did do that , it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal , having so many pieces after all the problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience as it is , you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size it is not the same . 
i bought this tea as i like blueberries , and stash is known as making good teas however , when i first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green \( not very appetizing \) once i mixed the powder with water , the resulting tea had no real flavor i feel like i wasted my money and ca n't get a refund . 
i introduced my daughter to earth 's best organic turkey vegetable dinner at 4 months a bit early , but she 's advanced , as she was 6 weeks overdue she loved it at first but , i bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite i 've tried some of it as well of all of them , this is also my least favorite . 
the first ball worked pretty well , it just looked a little beaten up since then , half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water \( all of them do after sitting for a bit \) if you do n't mind the rate of failure , the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being steeped for a long time \( especially considering that it is white tea \) . 
purchased two liters looking for an oil to put in salads , on bread , etc something with a strong flavor of olive oil this is not it this is good for cooking has little flavor . 
i really like the taste of this coffee ! my only complaint is that the coffee grinds end up in my coffee not a huge fan of that and even though i really like the taste of it i will not order again , bummer ! ! \( . 
they look like a good idea my wife and i thought we would give them a try they are pretty easy to use the thing we do n't like is the mess they make in the machine even when to top is secure , they leak into the machine you have to keep cleaning the filter basket or it gets sticky i would advise you to use something better like the e z cup . 
if you 're used to dave 's insanity sauce , or like me you 're used to dave 's ultimate insanity sauce , you 're going to be really disappointed 5 of the 6 sauces are n't spicy at all they 're probably at a spiciness level below tobasco sauce i tried really hard to like them but i just ca n't get over how watery and weak they are the only saving grace of the package is that it comes with a bottle of regular insanity sauce , but as i mentioned above , i prefer the ultimate insanity sauce i guess i have plenty of salad dressings . 
once or twice a year for a little variety and that 's about enough for my cat of this particular variety he likes it for a change from his chicken , turkey and beef , but not very often he will eat about 3 4 of the can and then he 's had enough he 's not a huge fish fan anyway , but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties the chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does , it will be easier to chew do n't know why my cat does n't like this type of fish , but he really could care less about it . 
this is a good decaf coffee , but i 've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup it 's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess . 
the basic problem with this product is that unless you load a very small amount of coffee in the filter , the filter clogs this causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and cause a mess my son and i spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have admitted defeat i suspected the filter but i used filters which work perfectly fine in my ez cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter even worse , coffee grounds in my coffee ! however , if you like your coffee very weak , this will work well for you i hope they can fix the design issues until then , i will stick with my ez cup . 
i ordered this plant as a gift for a friend and was not told until recently that the plant had died shortly after she received it she said she followed care instruction but the leaves started to fall off and it wilted and died i wish i had known sooner but she just told me last week . 
it 's a small drink at just 8 3 ounces but that 's probably the size drink we should all be consuming so i wont ding it on that point it 's made with good ingredients and as it says `no sugar added' but do n't let that fool you into thinking it 's low in sugar having 34 grams a coke contains 45g of sugar but it 's almost 50 larger so even without adding sugar this is a drink that 's fully loaded in defense of the switch at least the sugar is natural with no high fructose corn syrup obviously it has no caffeine which i have some issues with so that 's a plus over soda although at 36g of carbs it seems a bit high and 140 calories is nothing to sneeze at br br so it ca n't be considered a health drink since you can get lower sugar , carbs and calories from a similar size glass of tropicana orange juice so how is the taste \? my wife described it as tasting like soap i would n't go that far but i will say the despite its good ingredients it actually tasted artificial to me i was n't a big fan and personally i'm going to stick with water and orange juice and beer . 
my dog is a finicky eater when it comes to canned food after trying many varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store , the alpo chicken in gravy is all he will eat \( i can sometimes feed him the t bone steak flavor \) i guess it looks and tastes more like people food than the other varieties my only complaint is that when i received the shipment \( pack of 24 \) , almost all of the cans were dented , and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can one can leaked out the dent was at the seal on the top normally , i'm not someone who is picky about dented cans , but this was a little much a couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when i opened them so , i guess i 'll go back to buying at the grocery store just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than lugging them home from the store oh well . 
i hated this coffee i'm much more of a starbucks or peet 's loyalist , so maybe i'm a bit spoiled but after reading many positive reviews of this company i decided to give it a try big mistake i had a hard time giving it away it definitely tastes like chicory blagk bad news . 
i was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of nana 's chocolate munch cookie bars to me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder ca n't even cover up i threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar . 
i use to purchase jamaica beans locally and it was great this jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it the odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale other people in household tried it and could n't get past the first cup pitched the remainder cups in the trash . 
i like kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked i bought a bigger sized bag from costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly so i do n't know why these were different br will never buy these chips from here again . 
saw this on oprah 's favorite things and thought it would make a great little christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as i do since they come in packages of three , i kept one and gave two away i could n't open mine to clean it , so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time i thought it was just too tight from the factory my basil looked great after ten days but when i went to use the basil , i could not open the pod husband not home neighbor not home dog missing thumbs i tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle \( okay , maybe a little harder than 'lightly , ' i was pretty frustrated \) luckily i had emptied the water , so i only had a small mess to clean up the pod went into the garbage forcefully i checked with my friends friend 1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it friend 2 has now been warned there were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments i 've read , we 're not the only ones who have had this problem i think this was designed by the same guy that invented the security wrapping tape on music cds ! i 've gone back to my old method a wide mouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabric it works ! . 
kettle brand chips used to be so good oily , crunchy , flavorful i suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse now they 're no better than any other big name brand chip try the good health kettle style olive oil chips instead they are as good as the kettle brand once was r i p , kettle brand chips \( . 
i had to pick up a grocery store brand after running out of our regular innova dog food i fed this to my 160lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this brand produced ! he was going up to 10 times a day ! unbelievable ! this just goes to show how much filler is in this food would never recommend . 
first , the product pictured is not what you get br br what you really get is are tiny packets called sticks suitable for flavoring bottled water the box does n't even say what size bottle it is sized for br br i'm not keeping it so i ca n't tell you how it tastes . 
these brownies bake up very nicely i would call their consistency cake like however my husband called them healthy brownies he said he could taste the flax seed i tend to agree in my opinion , if i'm going to eat chocolate , i do n't want it to have that healthy taste on the other hand i love the blueberry muffins that hodgson mill makes . 
i found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting i would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea i'm not a pu erh expert and i am looking for something as authentic as i can get without paying an arm and a leg can anyone suggest a good quality \? \? the only reason i gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3 . 
i'm a little shocked that this so called health food product is made from chinese grown ingredients i 'd be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is also keep in mind that chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products all the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the united states why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price \? your purchasing choice does make a difference let 's stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy they never will we can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well being make purchase decisions wisely . 
it sure would be nice if they stated anywhere in the description of this coffee that it is flavored i love the bed and breakfast coffee , it 's just plain coffee , so i was surprised when i received the jamaica coffee and it was flavored yuck ! . 
i have several different ways of connecting xlr microphones to my computers for use in webinars , and i thought this design would be simpler to transport and connect , but when i tried to use it with a shure sm58 mic the volume it produced was about 25 of what i am used to , and was not adequate for my purpose . 
if you are looking for an actual organic dog food , newman 's own is not the way to go i accidently purchased this thinking it was what it claimed on the front package , only to read the ingredient list to find out that basically everything else but the chicken was organic with all of the drugs and hormones fed to conventionally raised food animals this ingredient is the most important one that should be organic . 
i ordered this pack of 20 1 pound full leaf tea which looked like a great deal well br br 1st , it 's not 20lbs of tea , i received only 1 br br 2nd , it 's not high quality full leaf tea , but rather the ground tea leaves you 'd expect from lipton br br strangely enough , i ordered the non decaf regular version and it arrived as full leaf tea and does n't taste half bad if someone receives something different than i or rather if someone receives what was advertised , i 'd like to know about it maybe i 'll try again . 
it 's crunchy , i'm now love the smoother nana 's like a href http www amazon com gp product b000fnex8c nana 's no gluten lemon cookie , 3 5 ounce cookies \( pack of 12 \) a or a href http www amazon com gp product b000fnex8m nana 's no gluten chocolate cookie , 3 5 ounces \( pack of 12 \) a you get the idea i hope ! ! br i do n't have coffee or chocolate anymore ! br if you do n't have a problem great but i found out i do ! ! . 
like most melitta brews , i found this one to be somewhat middle of the road it 's certainly not undrinkable , but it 's not the first one i 'd reach for , either as many of the other reviewers mentioned , i did find it nearly undrinkable when brewed in the quantity shown i think you have to at least double the amount you use to get a good cup , so take that into consideration when figuring the value br br i'm a little sensitive to caffeine and like to have a decaf on hand for drinking later in the day , and i bought this primarily to use with my mr coffee frappe maker \( a href http www amazon com gp product b002fwmf8g mr coffee bvmc fm1 20 ounce frappe maker a let me just put in a quick pitch for that , i love it ! \) i found the riviera sunset stood up well to all the milk , flavoring , and ice inherent in making a frappe \( again , with a significant increase in the amount used \) br br i would probably not purchase this coffee just because of my own views on coffee i look for bird friendly , fair trade brands , and i find nothing to indicate that melitta makes any effort to meet these expectations leaving aside these considerations , though , i think those who enjoy a somewhat light , easy drinking brew would like this coffee . 
the cocoa was n't too bad the taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes i was disappointed though when i went to a local store and saw it for less than what i paid just for shipping i really thought i was getting a good deal until i went home and checked the ticket i just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house ! so disapppointed ! ! \( . 
my favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like french , italian , and full city this k cup dark roast has a big , bold flavor , but lacks balance the level of smokiness , bitterness , and acid are way too high , and the result is not enjoyable i liked the dark roasts for the keurig from green mt , newman , and donut shop much more than this one . 
i took it at 5am yesterday it is now almost 3am the next day and i am laying in bed and skin feels tingly , ca n't sleep at all i feel like i am at super sayan level 4 , power of the red monkey i could shoot ki blast out the window if i wanted too maybe some kame hame wave 's too . 
it says habenero peppers on the ingredients , but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle smells like molasses and soy sauce taste like molasses and soy sauce absolutely boring . 
i thought the whole figs would be softer for spreading but they are not you have figs laying in a very sweet syrup i 've only tried it on toast one time and it was way to sweet to eat the figs just lay on top unspreadable i would not buy again save your money . 
i rarely post a product review , but i feel that i would be irresponsible as a consumer if i did not comment on the tanzania peaberry whole coffee beans i had high hopes when purchasing this coffee and i did my best to tolerate them to illustrate , i have consumed almost one whole bag of the three , but will have to dump the other two in the trash ! the beans are stale , dry , over roasted , with little flavor even loading up the coffee with sugar does not seem to help ! i resolved that this morning would be my last cup ! i will have to resort to buying the eight o'clock brand at my local grocery store i even briefly considered giving the two unopened bags to a friend , but decided that it was n't worth alienating him ! coffee bean direct , you need to do better , much better . 
unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously , i neglected to not look for the word supreme in this offer and since i was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered we \( that is my husband , guests and me \) knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed but , currently amazon featured the supreme babka and now i am awaiting to receive these in the future , i will read more carefully . 
how can tang be lugubrious \? if you made it a bit watered down , a bit more aftertasty , a bit less child friendly it 's an all right soda , but i do n't feel the thrill of drinking it that i did drinking tang as a child i ca n't pretend i'm an astronaut with this sometimes , advertising just helps . 
my cat will not eat this food i do n't know why , but it was a waste of money i was looking for something cheap so i guess you get what you pay for . 
i wanted to love this because i love earl grey tea , i need decaf and i adore the convenience of the keurig unfortunately , i do n't love these the flavor is very weak and does n't deliver on the aroma i typically use the large cup setting on the 3 size model , but even the small cup is wimpy with these i did find that mixing this one with a stronger flavored decaf tea results in a more suitable strength , but then you have to make 2 cups of something the english breakfast decaf is a much better choice . 
i did not find this drink anything special in terms of taste it is orange juice infused with carbonation the juice is quite acidic and you do n't feel that there is 100 fruit juice the drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer it does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free , no sugar and no artificial flavors this drink does n't have any special features and it does n't stand out well in a market crowded with many drinks br br 1 a href http www amazon com gp product b0014wyxqk izze fortified sparkling juice , pomegranate , 8 4 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a br 2 a href http www amazon com gp product b000q3ecxm minute maid mixed berry juice , 24 10 fl oz bottles , 240 fl oz a br 3 cal valls certified organic juices clementine \( 24 fluid ounce \) by igourmet com . 
just in case , if anyone does n't know what white tea is , as opposed to green or black , let 's quote wikipedia white tea is fast dried , while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan \( while kept moving for even curing \) oolong and black teas are fermented before curing what does it mean \? for me , it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day objectively and scientifically speaking , white tea is said to have more anti oxidants and less caffeine so , in my view , it 's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties br br this particular product , while it comes in tea bags , it 's not exactly your 'supermarket' variety unlike the cheap teas , black , green , herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags , the 'choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped , biodegradable , nylon like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves , not some indistinct crushed powder br br this being a white tea , 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case i found the added flowers to be a little too strong , bordering to overpowering for my taste the lychee and osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste think of sweet , green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma if it 's not 'love at the first sip' , give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors or not br br ingredients br br organic , fair trade certified white tea br natural lychee flavor br organic osmanthus flavor br contains caffeine br br the somewhat off balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer time will tell but at this time 3 stars \( meaning 'it 's okay' \) seem to be the fair rating . 
this is the 1st k cup coffee that i am getting grounds in my coffee it is occuring about every 3 cups i have not had this problem with other k cup manufactures i will not reorder . 
taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before i mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning small print on the bottom of the box \( i mean 6 point font \) tells this several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine i do n't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale . 
this candy is not as described the middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described br looks and tastes like it 's way past it 's expiration date br would never reccommend this paid a good chunk of cash for nothing . 
we have a year old pug who will eat just about anything but these ! unfortunately he just would not go near them no matter how hard we tried to peak his interest . 
i personally did not care for the coffee , too mild for me and a little nutty flavor in it i will stick with tully 's kona and house blends , also emeril 's big easy bold . 
i bought this for a christmas gift , but i will be returning there is no box or packaging as pictured , it is just 5 white baggies containing the mixes , which would be fine if i was just buying for myself but not for a gift . 
these are not dop they 're just certified which means nothing significant they should go a step further with a little more nonsense and write department certified real dop tomatoes are much better . 
potatoes were good two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly 10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality like i said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for x mas dinner today or i would n't have had enough 24 oz of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol \( not omaha 's fault \) . 
the uncle ray 's bbq potato chips are comparable to lays or most commonly available chips in local markets the bbq spice ia a bit too much the one pound bags consisted of about half broken chips i wo n't think about buying these again , even with the discounted price and will pay a bit more for a much better kettle fried potato chip . 
wow , i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars the other posters say they notified earth 's best about this in august and they are still selling it without checking or recalling ! ! no more earth 's best for my little guy i am taking my business elsewhere and i am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars they gotta do better than this to get my business . 
i was n't thrilled because i had to pick out tiny bits of gravel the flax seeds themselves were fine , top quality if it were n't for the gravel bits \( that get through the sieve w the seeds , i guess \? \) , this would get 5 stars . 
unlike another product i reviewed for vine , at least this product does not have sugar per se in it it is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of \( in this order \) apple , grape , tangerine and last as well as least acai concentrate the first two on the list , apple and grape are two of the most common fruit sweeteners used in beverages etc that is why the product tastes sweetened br br it has 140 calories quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water and all of it is from carbohydrates \( 36 grams \) and over 90 of the carbs \( 34 grams \) are sugars apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of fructose a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use , but it is also known to cause diarrhea , particularly in children br br so another drink on the hit parade of pretend healthy drinks appealing to the masses' concern for their ever growing girth and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth br br you are better off drinking diet coke you would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories my favorite is bella familglia in pomegranate , lime , lemon and orange flavors and is sold from time to time on amazon as well as your local supermarket br br better yet , buy some organic pure fruit juice such as pomegranate and pour 1 8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water at least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract . 
on a trip to italy , muesli is what all the hotels had for breakfast as their cold cereal and i loved it imagine how excited i was when i saw that kellog 's sold this product what did i learn \? despite the similar name , this cereal is quite unlike european style muesli while the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar , this cereal is mostly a flake cereal , while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all br br real muesli is made of rolled \( not flaked \) grains this has pluses and minuses on the plus side , milk does not turn european mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals on the minus side , european mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so \( i e while you are in the shower , or while the coffee is brewing \) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side for those that are concerned about eating processed foods , rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones \( rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted flaked grains are fully steam cooked until they are mush , pressed into flakes , fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend time to mushiness \) and certainly only the kellog 's product contains hfcs br br you owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from amazon \( or better yet , single boxes from a local health foods store if you have one \) and see what you prefer i eat the bob 's red mill product available on amazon \( and one of my local grocery chains \) instead of this , and am much more satisfied i have n't tried familia \( but i'm not crazy about the idea of the fruit flakes \) , and the dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me the other products are a hair more expensive than the kellog 's , but i'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product br br i'm surprised quaker does n't sell a muesli product given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the u s , you 'd think it would be a natural fit for them . 
going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optional and definitely not recommended i knew something was amiss when i opened the product and it was the consistency of very fine white beach sand putting my reservations aside , i proceeded to make pizza dough as directed on the box needless to say , the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange i would not recommmend this product for pizza dough . 
with any low fat or low calorie food , you 're going to sacrifice taste of portion size with this product , you sacrifice both br br it 's a good idea , which was done well with the oreos and others in this series of 100 calorie snacks , but i think you 're better off with a single cookie from the regular chips ahoy box than a whole bag of these . 
i usually enjoy a cup of coffee a few days a week , more as an indulgence than as a necessity it 's a sipping beverage for me , and flavor matters a lot that said , i add milk and sugar , so i'm not excessively picky \( or i think so , at least \) so i'm always glad to find new gourmet blends to add to my list of favorites br br this blend seemed promising , with a very nice aroma and a perfect , even grind i usually grind my own beans , but found that this grind worked nicely in my espresso machine as is it even produced a rich , smooth crema unfortunately , my first sip without sugar or milk was very bitter i ended up adding about a half teaspoon more sugar than i usually use just to compensate even then , the coffee flavor , itself , was thin and weak with just a little milk added , it tasted more like , well , flavored milk br br this coffee reminded me of the inoffensive bland coffee my parents used to get for our drip coffee maker a couple of decades ago fine for that application , but not really what i'm looking for in rich , smooth flavor with low bitterness . 
ok but would never buy them again my husband ate some br br i thought they tasted a lot like the chips they used to call muncho's ! br br just not for me ! . 
this mix makes nice pancakes they smell rich and vanilla y , but you do n't actually taste it as strong as it smells i wo n't buy them again because there are easier mixes out there that taste pretty darn close i'm just as happy using a krusteaz brand mix that only requires the addition of water \( no eggs or milk or flour necessary \) heck , if you want that vanilla smell and taste , add an eighth or quarter teaspoon of some extract to your batter br br edited for grammar 's sake . 
i too was a little disappointed with the mix of the donut sampler in my case i had 12 of the 35 were decaf but i guess this is what you get when you purchase a sampler pack through the amazon warehouse deals section all the k cups had a best used by date of 6 2012 i was happy about that atleast . 
i bought these at my local grocery store i wish i would have read the review on here first the positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin the negative is they are so bitter i could barely finish my half i just recently found out i have celiac disease so i cant have gluten i have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so i can not compare it to any others i have tried the betty crocker gluten free brownie mix and that is wonderful so i do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there . 
i do n't know how people could say this does n't smell or taste bad it is horrible ! ! i was getting raw goat 's milk for quite a while and when we moved it was n't available the fresh raw milk was delicious and mild and did not have that gamey odor and flavor that this milk has maybe some people do n't mind the taste , maybe some acquire a taste for it , and maybe some even like it , but i think it is vile if you like the taste of the goat 's milk cheese in stores , then you may like this , if not , stay far , far away ! . 
we bought this to replace our cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa they are less expensive but you get what you pay for this cocoa is watery brown sugar water with an aftertaste i do not recommend it a href http www amazon com gp product b005k4q1t0 grove square hot cocoa cups , dark , single serve cup for keurig k cup brewers , 24 count a . 
i ordered this product because of a good price deal amazon shipped accordingly , absolutely no problems there however , the taste of this product was horrendous it tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it i personally will go back to buying swiss miss in a can and just using the keurig to give me hot water , cheaper and much better tasting . 
not my idea of a good caramel flavors of ginger and pistachio dominated same for the chocolate walnut and orange honey varieties i missed the mix of rich , buttery , dairy flavor with caramelized sugar that i expect in caramels . 
i was looking for a simple and inexpensive way to provide my own supply of home made k cups this product is all that it is described to be fairly easy to use and does not adversely affect the cup of coffee clearly , the cups and lids are in fact reusable albeit a little messy br i have used all 50 filters so i am at a point where i need to decide if i want to continue on with this regimen or go to plan b br i am electing to try one of the reusable style cups that do n't require the use of a filter my hope is that it will be a little quicker and less messy to use br however , if plan b does not meet my expectations i can always order another supply of filters and continue on with this disposacups system . 
i 've been buying these for nearly 5 years and this is the fiirst time that my son has refused to eat them they are darker green than usual , which was not a problem , but the texture was chewier and the flavor was n't as good this is a problem since it 's the only vegetable my son eats and he has severe feeding issues the taste texture were so different he was gagging not pleased with the change . 
i ordered this item and was not pleased when it arrived , however the seller promptly contacted me to make things right they refunded my purchase in full after requesting a photo of the item their response was quick and much appreciated i will likely not purchase plants online any longer , however , if i do , i would not hesitate to consider this seller again mainly because of their customer service . 
i purchased the mango flavor , and to me it does n't take like mango at all there is no hint of sweetness , and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice i 've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades , so i'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products i 've tried the mango flavor is one of the least appealing i 've tasted it 's not terrible , but it 's bad enough that i notice the bad taste every sip i take . 
we have used this product before and love it , so decided to send some as a gift to friends the cans were received dented two of the cans were significantly dented the 3 cans were taped together , but no other packaging was in the box one side of the box was torn the shipping receipt was not included nor was the gift message that we had requested our friends had no idea where these 3 beat up looking cans of walnut oil came from or who sent them until we called and asked if they had received them shipping was also suppose to be in 2 3 days was not received until day 6 will find another way to purchase this product , but not through amazon . 
i 'll add to the growing list of reviews here regarding the windows 7 usb audio device error i figured i had a 50 chance of it working it did n't windows 7 insists on loading a usb driver that does n't work there is a review here giving details on how to possibly circumvent this loading process , however , that did not work for me its easier to return this thing , than spend my whole weekend jerking around in windows 7 hardware manager br br blue probably has a good product here , and probably blames windows for this issue however , blue should provide a driver that works do n't rely on windows to do this that is corporate laziness spend some resources on programming something that works for windows 7 make it available on your support website , and make it true plug and play not plug and cross fingers , then spend hours messing around in the weeds of windows settings br br also agree with other reviews here in the 2 days i spent with this product it 's all plastic parts , feels cheap and fragile , and the gain button is poorly thought out br br hey blue you had my business then you lost me i'm moving on to something else . 
you can order the same products online from nespresso for approx 25 and you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items , some of which you may not like br br nespresso makes great coffee and great machines the nespresso capsule offers posted on amazon however are all by third parties who prey on people who do n't know better . 
when i first started to use iams savory sauce , my dogs loved it after a few weeks , they do n't seem to care too much for it anymore they still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while , and will eventually eat it when they are hungry , but they do n't consider it to be a treat anymore i still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced , and low calorie one big negative i have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it they are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around the mouth stains i used to buy all different flavors of iams savory sauce , buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining vitagravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins , so if your must have some sort of gravy , i recommend vitagravy a bit more or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog this creates a gravy like texture and aroma that most dogs love not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues , but a great free solution for picky eaters . 
defintely not as tasty as the madhouse munchies which are my family 's favorite kettle 's are dark burnt , more broken bits , taste greasy oily and not the light crunch oh well . 
i bought a 24 pack of this an drank almost all of them before realizing what the flavor reminded me of it tastes like hotdog water . 
these arrived fresh and in a timely manner however , flavor wise our family is in agreement that jelly belly produces a richer plum flavor , slightly larger sugar plum in size , and a bit softer in texture for their sugar plums the price on the albanese sugar plums is reasonable , the flavor is good and it 's always nice to support a small , independent candymaker ! . 
here 's yet another carbonated juice drink , comparable with ooba hibiscus with orange , 16 ounce bottle \( pack of 12 \) a href http www amazon com gp product b0014x5o1c izze fortified sparkling juice , clementine , 8 4 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a this one , however , is an unusual combination of orange tangerine i did n't really like the flavor much though i like both orange tangerine separately but , the taste is in the bud \( s \) i prefer the izze of the 3 as for the juice , it 's more apple grape than orange tangerine the vit c is the silly recommended dose to prevent scurvy not much really \( per linus pauling \) true , it does n't have corn syrup sugar or substitutes which is nice but , at close to 1 8 3 oz it 's equivalent to about 1 50 for 12 oz \( in a pack of 24 small cans \) seems pricey to me why not just buy orange juice \? . 
i purchased cases of these for our company picnic the boxes were cute , the idea of it all was a big hit but the gift inside was a bust i would gladly have paid more for a stupid little item rather than the writings on paper , or whatever they were what is cracker jack without the gift inside \? i find it to be misleading that they call it original original had the gift inside . 
i have fed my 2 cats these treats the last 2 days within 5 minutes of eating them , they are both throwing up i will be going back to the three dog bakery treats expensive but have never made my cats sick why is the company not responding to so many bad reviews \? . 
this product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award the box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal , so at least 50 of the interior of the box is air then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60 the length of a normal snack bar the rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper if they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25 of the space inside the box br br as far as taste goes they are so so on the dry side with a hint of berry flavor celiacs , who are used to inferior products , wo n't be disappointed in the taste of this one br br i 've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging the picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie but when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter br br i really want to like this company they seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process that is why i 've continued to try their products i bought their granola many times , always wanting to like it , but it is some of the worst food i 've ever had the clusters are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than people br br all in all i would not recommend enjoy life foods . 
these little cups are a waste of money the kerug machine had a difficult time processing the coffee through the cup , and as a result i ended up with several half cups of coffee br br i tried it about 10 times , and then gave up . 
ive noticed that my dog has had more frequent bowel movement than usual he is on a strict schedule for potty break and has been very good on it for the past 4 years until i tried this food now he poops in my apt in front of us because he has to go so bad , like the poster above , its one hell of a laxative when my very well trained yorkie cant even hold it in . 
the description of the item is small pieces , diced i would call them chopped they 're basically what you 'd find on a banana split or a sundae or perhaps decorating a chocolate cake or cupcake i like the toasted flavor and put them on oatmeal they do not come in a sealed package as shown in the photo mine came in a folded over plastic bag inside a cardboard box . 
the ener g english muffins that i received from amazon were not of the same quality when i buy them directly from the distributor in seattle they crumbled and had dense places that were not really edible also , there were only 4 in the pack instead of 6 i had to cancel my recurring order . 
a great idea that falls short bisquick gluten free still uses an aluminum based baking powder that is toxic to humans aluminum lodges in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in autistic individuals the company refuses to respond to customer inquiries concerning this i cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed . 
the can does not say no antibiotics i called the company and asked why the can does not say this first , she tells me that they have no antibiotics but the fda wo n't allow them to put it on their can i said lots of companies put no antibiotics on their label then she said we are making a new label i felt a definate flippant attitude i felt like she just wanted me to get off the phone br br well , i just canceled my autoship for their goat milk i am now looking for another goat milk that puts no antibiotics on their label i know that there are some good goat milk companies that do this . 
i have ordered many tubs of fondarific in many colors , and generally do n't have many problems if you are looking for a fondant to sculpt figurines out of , this is not the fondant for you it is , however , the best tasting fondant you will find , guaranteed it does not dry out which is lovely for covering cakes , but is the reason sculpting is impossible br br this last time i ordered a five pound bucket in wedding white , it was horrible it was so soft it was almost gooey i had my ac at 65 degrees , placed it in the freezer for awhile , and it was still stretchy and soft as if i had been kneading it forever i even added some gumpaste and a ton of tylose to try to stiffen it a little , to no avail br br i was in a bind and had no time to get or make more fondant , so my cake took 3 times as long as it would have , and it looked horrible i was very disappointed br br i guess i just got a bad batch this time i would suggest that you order ahead of time and check it first so you do n't get stuck like i did . 
i expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips in reality i get an okay taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors chedder and salt pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips i 've ever had if you 're just looking for a great tasting brand of chips with health as a 2 on the list there are much much better brands out there in the end i compare these chips to diet soda vs regular some wo n't tell the difference while some will immediately sense it and hate it . 
i was drinking yuban organic medium roast coffee until i could not find it anymore at my local grocery store so i tried this instead what a let down after drinking the organic coffee this just tastes like average grocery store coffee comparable to folgers but the organic stuff , now that 's a different story that stuff is good tastes damn near as good as the fresh stuff you can buy at dunn bros or caribou coffee houses do n't believe me try both this and the organic version side by side you wo n't go back to this again i promise you that if you have any coffee sense at all . 
we have a gluten free household of 5 no one in our family likes these my children \( 9 , 7 , 5 \) are begging me to throw the box away i think they are afraid i 'll sneak one in their lunchbox the cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth have a glass of water nearby if you try these i hate to leave a bad review , but there are way better gluten free options out there br br \( i wo n't throw the box away i 'll pass it on to another gluten free family i know and let them form their own opinion \) . 
like the switch beverage i previously reviewed , this is a moderately tasty drink the balance of the carbonation and the fruit juice is decent enough , giving more of a tickle to the tongue than the rush of bubbles that soda usually gives it 's definitely a lot more like juice than soda , which goes against its purpose of being a replacement for soda overall , it 's pretty drinkable , but i would never seek this beverage out there are better juices , and there are better sodas br br one major plus , though , was that it was n't as thick and syrupy as the watermelon strawberry switch br br 6 10 . 
i was really excited and surprised when i found this mix in my local wal mart given it was a good price , i figured id give it a shot before i whipped up a batch i figured id do a little investigating to see if there was any input suggestions on the mix wow is everyone using the same mix or what \? reviews from its great to its horrible like a total 50 50 split soooooo , before i wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself , i figured id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix , all on its own ummmmm , yeah it totally has a pretty strong bitter after taste and , like another reviewer , i had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener \( i dont like things very sweet , at all \) but its def not as i re read the ingredients i realized there isnt any sugar sweetener in this mix so , youd def need to add sweetening but , overall , i dont even plan on taking this mix that far im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away id strongly suggest avoiding this mix i hope the company works on this mix it has good elements to it \( i like the fact you can determine how sweet youd want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty \) and i think it could be really tasty . 
the purchase and receipt of the box of chocolates was very good , and made my home in plenty of time for christmas the box was opened the day after new years the cholocates were discolored and dry the box had expired two months before i made the order i made a complaint with amazon which was resolved in a few days with full credit to my charge card this company wanted me to mail them back the chocolates which i had saved along with the wrapper they would not reply back to my inquiry as to who would pay for the shipping the chocolates back to the seller i still have the out of date and bad box of cholocate and will keep them for inspection for the next month or so then trash can . 
this one tasted pretty good very tangy , but in a 'real fruit' kind of way i think they got this one right i still ca n't ever see myself buying a bunch of this maybe if amazon sent me more than a single can to try , i would have build a habbit of drinking them \( cough hint cough \) br br i do n't really understand any drink this size if i were thirsty at all , i would want way more , at least 12 oz the only other drinks this size are those crazy energy drinks , and those are obviously more of a 'means to an end' kind of drink i guess it is supposed to be more of a gourmet soda juice i guess there is a market for that , i'm just not part of it br br nice little carbonated juice , but still not really worth the effort money for me . 
when i bought this food , i saw the image and price and assumed that i would be paying a fair price \( 1 less per bag than the grocery store \) for low grade cat food the image and price combination led me to think that i would be paying 45 for 6 18lb bags a good deal when i received six 3 6lb bags , i thought there had been a mistake nope so , i spend 40 returning it \( i bought three 6 packs oops \) and now ozbo customer service tells me they take 2 3 weeks processing returns ! my kitties need food now , and these people want to sit on my 180 for that long \? do not buy from these scammers ! ! ! . 
i'm of russian descent and have been eating buckwheat for my entire life i live in the us and usually buy buckwheat in local russian or eastern european stores this is the first \( and last \) time i tried american made buckwheat here are things that i found br 1 it takes only 10 12 min to cook this normally , it takes 25 30 min and this item is not branded as an instant buckwheat br 2 it tastes quite different than usual br 3 there is a strong metallic smell br 4 this item is overpriced just go to the closest russian or eastern european shop and buy the same thing 4 times cheaper . 
if you like your flavored coffee to taste like coffee , this may not be for you i could n't taste the coffee at all in the travel size brew , but the smaller brew sizes were a bit better . 
when i eat junk food , i 'd like to enjoy it , the guilty pleasure it is br br these cookies are neither healthy or tasty stick to chewy chocolate chip cookies . 
what more can i say barley edible crunch on sugar did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it did n't sell or maybe bad batch does n't make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth kids probably do n't care hope this helps . 
this tea is so strong you might as well not waste time brewing and just chew the leaves right out of the container it 's strong not in a normal strong tea way instead it 's bitter if you use a keurig model that has cup size settings a recommendation is to go with the largest setting for the largest cup you can fit under the keurig and work backward from there until you get to the taste you prefer also note that while it 's in smaller print , there is a warning not to use a glass to make the iced tea which is a warning worth paying attention to . 
when i saw some of the earth 's best jars offered as a gold box deal , i remembered that i needed to offer a caveat to other parents br my children have previously enjoyed many earth 's best flavors , which in general taste quite good , so in february when there was a promotional offer through amazon , we ordered two 12 packs when they arrived , one of the 12 packs seemed ok , but the other 12 pack contained several broken jars and was leaking it smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12 pack br i noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12 packs had air filled padding on only the top side of the box , which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side br i do n't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery , but either way , i was afraid to use the unbroken jars too , because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too \? br for more durable items , i still order from amazon , but i canceled my subscription of the earth 's best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where i can check them first . 
when i received the package just earlier today i was excited to try it out immediately i'm already a loyal drinker of the yamamotoyama iced green tea powder and wanted to give stash a try , particularly the mint flavor \( yamamotoyama only has three flavors original unsweetened , sweetened and raspberry \) when i checked the ingredients of this product \( ground sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor \) i already expected that this would be unsweetened \( after all , mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said natural , i expected it unsweetened \) br br i do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle , however i could sense a bit of the mint maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content , you 'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong mint flavor br br but the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it \( well in this case it has natural peppermint in it \) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats , such as smoothies and even desserts just the other day i even added the yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my muesli hot cereal and it was delicious i plan to do the same with this stash mint green tea powder \( i'm an experimenting foodie so does n't hurt to try lol \) with my hot cereal and milk br br you can even substitute milk instead of water ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from starbucks and jamba juice before \? try it with this one \) . 
it 's got the typical jif taste , which to me is unremarkable it 's just peanut butter however , the single serve containers are convenient and transport well the consistency is great it 's not runny yet it 's also not a solid hunk a peanut butter with floating oil either good for dipping pretzels or celery other veggies , and in the absence of a spreder you can just tear off the top and squuush the contents onto bread br br the price is right . 
nice price , and glad to see a subscribe save option on k cups however this was undrinkable in our opinion did n't seem to be too watery like another reviewer said , just a bad off taste . 
the taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker which is not bad , except that i bought them because i wanted a cheese taste br br what was a huge disappointment \? how misleading the packaging of the box is the photo on the box \( i bought these in store \) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads \( expanding the length and width of the box \) wrong ! the plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2 smaller all around leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads br br what is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco friendly packaging fail ! they used a huge box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers not ecofriendly at all br br would i buy these again \? no i feel ripped off the other crackers \( like sesame tarragon \) give you a little br more bang for your buck and have more flavor .
