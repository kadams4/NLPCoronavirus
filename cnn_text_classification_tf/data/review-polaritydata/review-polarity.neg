product arrived labeled as jumbo salted peanuts the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as jumbo . 
if you are looking for the secret ingredient in robitussin i believe i have found it i got this in addition to the root beer extract i ordered \( which was good \) and made some cherry soda the flavor is very medicinal . 
my cats have been happily eating felidae platinum for more than two years i just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different they tried the new food when i first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food i 've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past unfortunately , i now need to find a new food that my cats will eat . 
i love eating them and they are good for watching tv and looking at movies ! it is not too sweet i like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so i can take my time eating them . 
the candy is just red , no flavor just plan and chewy i would never buy them again . 
this seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands , but it is somewhat mushy and does n't have quite as much flavor either it did n't pass muster with my kids , so i probably wo n't buy it again . 
the flavors are good however , i do not see any differce between this and oaker oats brand they are both mushy . 
this is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores there is nothing healthy about it it is just carbs and sugars save your money and get something that at least has some taste . 
this oatmeal is not good its mushy , soft , i do n't like it quaker oats is the way to go . 
we 're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy doubt very much habanero is used at all could take it up a notch or two . 
watch your prices with this while the assortment was good , and i did get this on a gold box purchase , the price for this was br 3 4 less at target . 
arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags ! ! . 
i purchased the mango flavor , and to me it does n't take like mango at all there is no hint of sweetness , and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice i 've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades , so i'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products i 've tried the mango flavor is one of the least appealing i 've tasted it 's not terrible , but it 's bad enough that i notice the bad taste every sip i take . 
if you 're impulsive like me , then 6 is ok do n't get me wrong , the quality of these babies is very good and i have no complaints but in retrospect , the price is a little ridiculous \( esp when you add on the shipping \) . 
buyer beware please ! this sweetener is not for everybody maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body you will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience nausea , diarrhea headaches can also be experienced i learned my lesson the hard way years ago when i fell in love with the sugar free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell i thought i 'd found sugar free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in the discomfort was unlike anything i had ever felt before i blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping as the symptoms passed , this too was very unpleasant though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit , all symptoms were gone when i stopped eating the chocolate my hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when i purchased some delicious sugar free popcorn at my local market the taste was amazing and while i was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy , new sugarfree treat taste so good , my heart sank when i followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener down to the very bottom of the label and read maltitol in tiny little letters ! thank goodness i 'd eaten only a little i still ended up with all the same side effects but for a much shorter duration some people can use maltitol to their heart 's content but others , like me , can have a bad reaction to it in case you 're like me , it 's not you it 's the maltitol ! . 
it is okay i would not go out of my way to buy it again . 
no tea flavor at all just whole brunch of artifial flavors it is not returnable i wasted 20 bucks . 
the taste was great , but the berries had melted may order again in winter if you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor . 
while my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food , for some reason their itching increased when i tried the lamb and rice i have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help the duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly , but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again i like natural balance for the quality ingredients . 
awesome dog food however , when given to my boston , who has severe reactions to some food ingredients his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night , scratching as soon as i changed to a different formula , the scratching stopped so glad natural balance has other choices i guess you have to try each , until you find what 's best for your pet . 
i fed this to my golden retriever and he hated it he would n't eat it , and when he did , it gave him terrible diarrhea we will not be buying this again it 's also super expensive . 
not what i was expecting in terms of the company 's reputation for excellent home delivery products . 
i was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix i usually like most of the low carb things i have tried , but was diappointed in this specific one . 
i love spicy ramen , but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation does n't go away for like 3 hours ! not sure if that is healthy or not and you can buy this at walmart for 0 28 , way cheaper than amazon . 
i must be a bit of a wuss , because this soup tastes to me how i imagine fire might taste typically i like spicy food if it has a good flavor i do n't find this to be the case with this soup any flavor is killed off by the burn . 
i might be mistaken , but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size if they did do that , it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal , having so many pieces after all the problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience as it is , you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size it is not the same . 
the salsa smelled delicious , as i think it probably was but , unfortunately , the person , at amazon , that is a packer \( there is probably several \) had very little stuffing to work with , especially on the bottoms therefore , the bottoms were broken on all three bottles as i reached for my computer i was told no returns \( cause it 's a food item \) i then looked for a customer service tag and i found none on their new face lift they seem to be proud of their new face lift but they should at least have a place to contact them in emergencies ! like i buy a lot of stuff and it all comes in styrofoam boxes never would i ship things br especially salsa in a cardboard box with just a stripe of large bubble wrap on it no matter how much the carrier \( fed ex \) is careful , it's going to break somewhere along the line especially in an all glass container ! barbara l s . 
these remind me of dog treats i made once using pumpkin and cinnamon they 're kind of bland and not my favorite back to nature product but my finace really loves them so that 's where the three stars come from . 
these singles sell for 2 50 3 36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles i'm not sure why amazon is selling it for 9 99 for a box of 24 singles hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite , but truly this is not a good buy . 
i have always purchased star kist tuna but thought i would try this brand for a change of pace the taste of the tuna was not pleasant , too much basil and other spices for me . 
seriously this product was as tasteless as they come there are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack you just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor . 
i do n't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere , but they were so old that they would n't cook i had to throw half of them out , because the skins were damaged , a clear sign of dried beans past their prime i ca n't even return these or ask for a refund , because food is not returnable will find a different brand to use for now , i have about fifty servings of beans to throw away . 
besides being smaller than runts , they look the same and have the same consistency unfortunately , they taste nothing like banana runts nor do they even taste good yucky stuff trying to return with vendor . 
the item over all was fine , but the banana heads are not just like banana runts they are alot smaller also when i received the item , the packaging was not great the banana heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope . 
we have been looking for natural ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule yes , we 'd probably be better served taking a yoga class , but this is a good second choice this helps you fall asleep and stay asleep i drank half the first night and that was plenty for me after about 30 minutes , i was ready for bed ! i woke up refreshed and with no sleepy drug hangover , so that is a huge bonus br br i gave the product 3 stars \( instead of the 5 it deserves \) as their packing job was marginal at best the product arrived with 2 broken bottles , which at this price is a 6 loss ! the bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box big packing fail , but the product is awesome . 
the coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright nescafe and mount hagen are better i bought this to try something other than these two , but i probably wo n't get this again there is just a slight vitaminy taste , but it 's not overwhelming it 's also a bit pricey for what you get . 
be careful not to eat too many of them in one day , as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a laxative ! ! ! lololol ! ! ! . 
even with small containers , they do n't fill them up these little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip off is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares \? or how about the cereal ploy , they were filled at the factory but settled in transport br can manufacturers be honest in their dealings \? . 
to me , these are nothing like the regular altoids and are not breath mints they are pleasant tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin , and that 's as far as it goes the mintiness is just not strong , and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis i'm not a dragon breath person , but still , one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath four or five will freshen my breath for a short while maybe 15 minutes at this point , i think the icebreakers frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints . 
too much of a good thing \? we worked this kibble in over time , slowly shifting the percentage of felidae to national junk food brand until the bowl was all natural by this time , the cats could n't keep it in or down what a mess we 've moved on . 
as with canidae , felidae has also changed their formula cats do not like change when it comes to their food and they just had to change it without putting it on their label we noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell \( as you will notice i have also reviewd the canidae , and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues \) br br prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home if cats get upset because of a change in enviorment , or a loud noise they can stop eating it depends on the cat two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight we took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal it has been a year since then and they are better then the formula for this food changed br br we started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us we asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food it was n't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and have n't suffered one bit like our dogs have br br cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it ! we have 5 rescued and fixed cats , none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula br br i urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the fda website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal as with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals , and tell me not to buy it this is just horrible ! . 
hey , the description says 360 grams that is roughly 13 ounces at under 4 00 per can no way that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can . 
my husband and i are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us it definitely makes you sweat a bit when you 're eating it it was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but i do n't think i would buy it again due to the heat we prefer the milder mccormick 's brand of fajita mix i 've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it was n't as spicy as this mix is br br if you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind to me it was more than medium hot but not by too much br br i gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it 's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it you take a plastic bag , a couple of tbs of vegetable oil , 1 4 cup water and mix the seasoning , water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes in the meantime , it says to stir fry your veggies \( peppers and onion \) but i found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and i do n't think it affected quality or taste i also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil br br i have one more package of this to use and next time i'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more . 
herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste it is only for people who like herbal taste i do n't . 
this candy is not as described the middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described br looks and tastes like it 's way past it 's expiration date br would never reccommend this paid a good chunk of cash for nothing . 
terrible ! artificial lemon taste , like pledge lemon furniture polish do n't do this to yourself just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest . 
the taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker which is not bad , except that i bought them because i wanted a cheese taste br br what was a huge disappointment \? how misleading the packaging of the box is the photo on the box \( i bought these in store \) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads \( expanding the length and width of the box \) wrong ! the plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2 smaller all around leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads br br what is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco friendly packaging fail ! they used a huge box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers not ecofriendly at all br br would i buy these again \? no i feel ripped off the other crackers \( like sesame tarragon \) give you a little br more bang for your buck and have more flavor . 
i 've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years , usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas , where many middle eastern stores carry loose ahmad teas , usually at 5 7 for a pound box i 've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea , with enough aroma and taste , and beautiful reddish color , perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own , but a decent base for mixes br this tea , however , is nothing of the sort freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell , and the brewed tea is weak , flat and tasteless somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore so , you get a lot of tea for the money , but the quality is such that you might as well drink lipton bags , they are not that much worse . 
the pork chops from omaha steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem . 
five minutes in , one tentacle was bitten off , ball inside cracked in half not durable enough to be a dog toy disappointed \( so is the dog \( . 
i felt energized within five minutes , but it lasted for about 45 minutes i paid 3 99 for this drink i could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money . 
yes , it 's probably healthier than 5 hour energy or starbucks shots but if you 're looking to avoid a caffeine overload , this is still not for you most energy drinks cannot be made w out a high dosage of caffeine i believe the caffeine content of 1 guayaki shot is 150 ml probably lower than other un healthy energy shot drinks but i believe most other people avoid the top brands b c they contain too much caffeine and or sugar if you do not react well to caffeine , guayaki is not a good buy either i definitely feel an energy boost w 1 full guayaki shot but not w out all the other caffeine side effects irritability , nervousness , mood swings caffeine overdose is why i stopped drinking coffee but it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe br br now you 're not sensitive to caffeine , then it 's a great buy it 's not loaded w sugar the taste is easy and pleasant it 's not loaded w a bunch of chemicals like 5 hour shots or starbucks drinks and the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body weight br br side note if you want to feel energized during the day , have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy , fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy ! . 
i so wish i would have read this review before purchasing two gallons of this oil for my health issues it reeks like a chemical rubber smell this smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid when i called to report the situation to the company , sabrina told me i would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab unbelievable good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund , including shipping the product is faulty period i will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership . 
this product has a strong after taste of crayola crayons ! br br i am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes upon opening the plastic container , the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room , and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it br br i suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as i have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased br br to date , my favorite coconut oil is distributed by barleans the flavor is fantastic however , they do not supply a gallon sized tub , and dr mercola has the best product in that size category . 
i have used and liked sugar in the raw for many years , after being introduced to it in a starbucks my most recent purchase , however , was disappointing the sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1 4th of the regular size having large crystals was something i always really liked about sugar in the raw it enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes i called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar they have had many complaints of a similar nature this , they claimed , also reduced the crystal size they said this problem should go away with their newer crop the representative said that the new crop sugar will have a 6 10 digit date code \( without any spaces \) that ends with a 1 and no letters the trailing digits are a date code using the julian calendar \( my recent bad purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a 51a \) bottom line their current product is not much better than much cheaper products when they get a better crop , i 'll go back to purchasing sugar in the raw . 
i used to buy this sugar for years i do not eat much sugar , but still this sugar is called turbinado sugar , but is misleading i picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar , and other brands \( in the local food store \) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something br br how did i find out \? i needed just a sweet water few days ago i put this sugar in the raw in the glass the water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just pure white sugar crystals ! ! ! ! ! what a shame on the producer ! u can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well br br i'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice . 
i thought this was a great buy , but as noted by scott d , the molasses content was not up to par i loved the higher molasses content sugar in the raw unfortunately what i purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and i have twelve 24 ounce bags i guess i 'll watch for the next crop . 
i paid 1 79 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today i bought them because brown rice is a good carb as soon as i tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip i checked the ingredients the name is deceptive these have masa corn flour listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste i wo n't buy these again i can get sunchips for less money and similar taste . 
howdy y'all , br br the actual product is very good i 'd rate the item a 4 on it 's own however , it 's only one dollar at the local grocery and twenty eight dollars per twelve pack these are running almost two and a half dollars each br br as i said , too expensive sigh i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost br br take care , br lee . 
nothing wrong with the product , but i sure had to mix it with lots of other ingredients to make it edible to me \( in texas i was called a baby mouth not into very spicy hot foods \) br br for comparison , i'm comfortable with tostitos medium chunky salsa 1 can of this milder rotel , mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes , was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips i used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though . 
i am a energy junkie and i'm not sure if this works or not , but what i do know is that the taste is not the greatest i do drink the steaz energy drink and i think i get the same results i like this products because it is more natural then the others . 
i purchased it because it was on sale in terms of the energy it provides , it works , but the taste leaves something to be desired i tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable . 
this is the first time i 've really been misled by other reviews on amazon i like 5 hr energy , i find rain ok and so i thought i 'd try this product based on the reviews boy am i sorry ! i gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched \( really \) and it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it ! but worst of all , within an hour i was yawning and drowsy unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea flavored cough syrup and do n't work , do n't buy this ! i do n't know what to do with the other 11 bottles big fail . 
the package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions i know how i normally cook couscous so tried 3 4 cup water to 1 cup couscous brought to a boil and let sit , covered for 5min it was mushy and tasteless we have thrown out the rest of the container . 
i would n't even think of buying this product unless i know the price per unit how can i compare other items online or in a store \? . 
i was amazed at how quickly it arrived ! it is a cute stocking stuffer , but only ok as far as user appeal you get what you pay for . 
toy was typical quality i expected i got taken for a major ride on the shipping ! . 
so we cancelled the order it was cancelled without any problem that is a positive note . 
i received the items in a timely manner upon receipt , i removed a pack to consume the pop tart was stale and left an awful taste in my mouth . 
taste like it is stale will not order this again i had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it this stuff tasted nothing , like the douwe egberts at the hall this is possibly stale coffee . 
serveice delivery with the seller was excellent the product was not will not order again bad taste iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes i throw it right away , i coudl not drink it . 
this product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned i could n't get the food pieces out to save my life i tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests . 
i love , love , love the idea of this product and my little one loves , loves , loves to use it she gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and i do n't have to worry about her choking the only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out granted , some foods are more difficult than others and some do n't cause that much of a problem bananas however , have pretty much destroyed a couple of them while i love this product , i think that next time i will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags . 
the munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product , it 's kind of like sucking on food through a cloth while my daughter was interested in it for a little while , she eventually lost interest i may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts . 
a very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and or honey definately not my cup of coffee oh , did i say it was bitter \? . 
the spicy version of this ketchup is n't bad , but it is too expensive the regular version is sweet as dessert horrible annie 's organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less even heinz organic is a better deal i gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass , not plastic . 
these condiments are overpriced and terrible the classic is disgustingly sweet the spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant . 
my cat will go for a day , probably longer , have n't tryed it , but he 'll walk right by this stuff every time , even when i know he 's hungery absolutely no interest i swear he 'd rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it ! ! . 
i have n't used the ham base it is loaded with msg i did not realize this when i ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item . 
i love the flour however amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product . 
this mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top there were no tears in the packages . 
just awful ! i thought food was supposed to taste good ! i had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth , it 's that bad . 
perhaps the worst bottle of wine i 've ever had i'm not even sure i would cook with this it is thin , no body , and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot the taste is just bitter not the complexity that i expect from a pinot noir of any price just not what i'm looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir maybe my bottle was n't sealed well and went to vinegar other reviews for this wine are favorable . 
a vile , miserable pancake i put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried i do n't know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix the buttermilk , baking soda \( sls \) and sea salt are not i am going back to nature 's path buttermilk pancake mix this one went straight into the garbage . 
honey dijon flavor okay flavor , but both my girlfriend and i thought they left a bad aftertaste the aftertaste is sort of like old cheese \( presumably some folks like this i'm not a fancy cheese eater \) , and it lingers for at least an hour i 'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5 br br we have also tried the ny cheddar flavor \( 4 stars \) , which we both liked better , and they did n't leave any long lingering or bad aftertaste br br i 'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars the chips are crunchy , but also greasy enough that i keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating kettle chips . 
i usually love kettle chips , and love salt vinegar , but these chips were way too vinegary for me ! they do have the typical kettle chip crunch , but are too aggressively flavored for my taste . 
ok , i did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful i took the plunge as i do like salty , and tangy flavors no , i had never had these before i took the leap and ordered a case at a super price they arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date feb 2011 umm , i'm in the middle on these chips , they are ok but not something i ca n't live without i love the crunch , the color , no trans fat they are a little too vinegary for my taste , which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet br br i have n't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience \) . 
i like kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked i bought a bigger sized bag from costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly so i do n't know why these were different br will never buy these chips from here again . 
i really love kettle brand chips , but these are rather disappointing there is very little sour cream or onion flavor . 
i took one and said good russet potato chip but i found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste , a bit oily and overcooked it may be because i am use to eating their great tasting a href http www amazon com gp product b000g6q4gm kettle chips spicy thai , 2 ounce bags \( pack of 24 \) a or perhaps because all the chips in the bags i received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning it is obvious the chips are flavored , but if i did not read the bag i would never have thought it had cheddar flavor and i love new york cheddar the flavoring included parmesan , cheddar , blue cheese , garlic and other spices a good chip even when overcooked , but i do not plan to buy them again . 
i agree with the other review , these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums the chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt vinegar combo unfortunately , every bag i received in that case was over cooked ! they were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag they definitely need to improve that ! . 
it was a great value and i like the package size but not vinegary enough for me wo n't order this brand again great chips otherwise . 
i was really looking forward to trying these chips since i love cheese but i was super disappointed ! i am a big fan of kettle chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain ! they are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that it 's annoying i do not recommend this flavor salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite . 
these are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth br br for my entire life sour cream onion \( and in this case chive \) chips were my favorite recently kettle brand honey dijon mustard took that slot so when i found out they had sour cream onion i just had to try them br br as soon as i opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk and indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful it tastes like rancid milk not just sour , but like sour cream that when rancid the powdery texture is also extremely unappealing i basically hated these chips i would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery , chalky texture on a chip , with a rancid \( and onion flavor \) and i have a hard time believing that person exists br br i plan on contacting kettle and sharing my thoughts with them hopefully they 'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips . 
kettle chips now look , feel and taste like lays these chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty now , no longer my favorite . 
this is the first time i tried sea salt vinegar chips not my taste make sure you like salt vinegar before ordering you may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before i 'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips . 
these were nasty , they were so greasy and too rich for my blood , plus they lacked major flavor , no spicy jalapeno flavor at all i was so dissapointed in these chips , i am always hearing great things about these chips but i am telling you , yuck yuck yuck give me pain chips any day maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but i am staying clear from these chips i wish i could give these zero stars if i could . 
these are decent , but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip , try boulder 's salt and malt vinegar chips those are awesome . 
being a salt free product is why i purchased this , but the chips are quite greasy . 
these things are just too darn cheesy if you like a lot of flavor , you 'll love these otherwise , you will overdose on their cheddary goodness . 
i once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy i discovered them when i was in england back in 2000 and quickly became a fan about a year ago i picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket i was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it after opening the bag i found the chips were not even close to the kettle chips i was used to they were all uniform whitish yellow in color , flavor was way off , the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and i was very disappointed so i e mailed kettle with the following what happened \? i bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste it tastes cheaper i do n't know how else to put it i also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as i did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor i am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product did i just get a weird batch \? i have been buying only kettle chips for about 10 years now so i am wondering i did receive a reply thanks for letting us know about your experience with your kettle brand chips it sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections , and we apologize our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color but our chips should still taste great ! thanks for providing us with the best before code from the bag this really helps when passing on your comments to our staff br we are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our kettle brand flavors or nut butters , believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase ! in case you buy this product again , we suggest avoiding the same best before date \( if you still have it \) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time br thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks please let me know if i can be of any more help well the next bag was good since that time i have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the bad bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost i did some research and found out that kettle was bought out by a private equity company so the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at kettle acquire company with high quality brand recognition , sell product to mass merchants , lower quality cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand stay away from kettle chips they are no longer the same . 
these bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces also felt very greasy had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin . 
the first time i tried these , i thought , wow ! but i quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart hard to enjoy the potato chippiness of them when your mouth is under seige . 
got these kettle chips sea salt vinegar \( 15 5oz bags \) and was not impressed tasted kind of flat i was eating some out of the bag , when i looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed then i started looking at all the unopened bags and many of them had this type same hole some bags had multiple holes one bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it the box they shipped in had no holes so they we 're packed this way so much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired needless to say i 'll never be eating anymore kettle products and expect a full refund from kettle or amazon br m martin . 
when originally produced in england these we 're the best chips i had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the us conglomerate they now taste plain nasty hard rather than crispy , are much thinner than they used to be and lacking any flavour , a real shame . 
after opening numerous bags i found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them completely plain and gross how does this even happen \? . 
these chips are okay personally , i find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange they 're not necessarily bad but they 're the kind of chip where you 're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty . 
i 've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning keeps you from eating too many ! occasionally i get really stale items from amazon com and this was one unedible beware of the quality of food items on this website that are on special as they can be very close to due dates or in this case , not expired but stale and unedible just the same . 
kettle brand chips used to be so good oily , crunchy , flavorful i suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse now they 're no better than any other big name brand chip try the good health kettle style olive oil chips instead they are as good as the kettle brand once was r i p , kettle brand chips \( . 
you can absolutely forget about these confirmed by other reviewers , these chips are now total garbage like chewing on styrofoam packaging peanuts positively awful , no hyperbole or exaggeration i 'll never buy anything from kettle brand ever again ! from a reportedly once great premium brand , literally any mass market chip i 've ever tried tastes better than these stale and rancid tasting , and virtually no salty taste whatsoever completely awful ! . 
these chips are nasty i thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag , no the chips were just soaked with grease nasty ! ! . 
unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar , i doubt you will like these chips these are the saltiest sourest chips i have ever had , and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because i paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food the brown chips are especially bad , besides being salty and sour , they also taste overcooked and burnt unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste , you will not like these chips br br i actually have a high tolerance for sour taste , so i can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty but normal people , please do not try this at home . 
i bought this brand as a trial since i am tired of the pingos br br it claims that it is natural i have no argument on this but the point is that more than 50 in the bag is over fried and in brown color i really suffer eating the over fried chips i open some other bags and it looks like the same so i just throw away all of them i do n't know if i was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same but for sure i will never buy this brand any more . 
these are better in england i do n't know why maybe it 's just nostalgia on my part . 
i ordered kettle chips in the following flavvors br salt fresh ground pepper br tuscan 3 cheese br n y cheddar and hers br br they all tasted the same to me if there is a variety pack suggest u order before ordering large size br br i wish i could return the unopened bags . 
i purchased these because of the low salt , and they were indeed low in salt however , many , many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil i have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands it was very unappetizing , and who wants all that oil \? i will never buy these again , and i would not recommend them to others . 
if you are looking for strong s v flavor these definitely are n't for you very mild in comparison to many others i live in tx and i can tell you i 've tried all s v chips i can get ahold of the best of the best are heb \( storebrand \) and world market bob 's and zapp 's are n't bad from a chip standpoint they have typically great kettle crunch , but if you 're looking for s v flavor these have just a touch . 
i do n't know if it was the case of chips we received or what , but everyone we allowed to sample the chips \( in a buffet style setting \) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side br one person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow , due to the amount of salt in these br br we had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the lay 's kettle mesquite potato chips , but these kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite br br sorry folks , we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side br br we are still looking forward to amazon finally getting the lay 's kettle mesquite potato chips in stock br these got a 2 star , because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique . 
these chips are greasy and taste burnt there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it \( especially at the bottom of the bag even if they are trans fat free , they need to be a lot less greasy . 
do n't waste your money on any of the kettle brand potato chips i bought a case of these , and a case of the cheddar and sour cream both cases ended up in the garbage can . 
defintely not as tasty as the madhouse munchies which are my family 's favorite kettle 's are dark burnt , more broken bits , taste greasy oily and not the light crunch oh well . 
i love sour food but this one i ca n't bear too strong sour taste and even when you open the bag , the sour smell is too strong i do n't like it . 
unless you really really really like vinegar avoid ! those chips should have been called vinegar and sea salt not sea salt and vinegar . 
used to eat the spicy thai flavor all the time msg makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was msg free now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage , a bunch more salt and msg stuffed in under the label yeast extract they removed the no msg from the label so they know very well what they did br br the worst part though is that they taste horrible instead of crisp , oily and full of character say as if they were cooked in like a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays the spicy thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid br br what a shame , no more kettle chips for me it seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore . 
the chips were great for the first few bags however , after the first bag or two , i noticed that the remaining bags were damaged there were holes in each bag and black , sticky stains on the outside other reviewers who bought around the same time that i did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips br br the chips came in a sealed kettle box , so it 's hard to say who screwed up but someone somewhere screwed up these chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag now \? it 's like a game of roulette . 
after waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive , upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse do n't know if it is still in the box , but it is outside on the porch when my son gets home , i'm going to have pictures taken and email to amazon the outside amazon box was intact , so it had to be either from the kettle chips people or the amazon warehouse , do n't know which i will never buy these again from amazon i cannot tell you how disgusted i am with this purchase it makes me sick to think about it ! br br i included pictures at the top of the page poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now br br update i forgot to mention that i offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to amazon but was told they did n't want them . 
terrible ! i cannot believe this , i received this item and every single bag was opened but 4 ! ! ! ! i'm stationed in afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions i was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box , gross ! and the box is filled with grease stains idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here , but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper i'm very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now . 
kettle branch potato chips new york cheddar these are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty , on the burnt side , and taste rancid , either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old i want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then but , after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips , these just do n't hit the spot for me . 
for those of you who , like me , had to order the kettle spicy thai chips from amazon because they are so hard to find locally , you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed they are just like regular potatoe chips i paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he did n't like the spicy thai , but these are fine for him br br yuck ! ! ! . 
while i admit that the oversalted chip is addictive , i really think this one has gone too far skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these i am surprised that they are still on the market . 
there is nothing too good or too bad about these chips if you like plain potato chips , you 'd like these they are thicker than most brands , fresh out of box , very crunchy and not too salty \( for me \) one bag has a lot , i generally cannot finish it by myself part of the reason is that they are too oily \( some chips almost look transparent , if you know what i mean \) the taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me if you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice , except salt , as the name says i do n't think i 'll buy these again the best by date on my bags are march 2011 and i ordered them at the end of october . 
i love this sea salt vinegar flavor from kettle when i saw this one on the daily deal here for 17 99 case , i put my order without doubt however , when i received the case , i found out that the whole case is expiring in december while i got it at the end of august i tried one package and i can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips i was disappointed and then i found out this item is not returnable ! how convenient ! although i love this chips , i wo n't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date . 
i dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did i checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me ! ! ! . 
the spicy thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market however , kettle foods has changed the ingredients used , with ginger being the most important that is now missing notice that they removed ginger with attitude from the bag sadly , the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me they are n't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non existent br br here are the original and new ingredient listings br br original ingredients br select potatoes , safflower and or sunflower oil , honey powder \( evaporated cane syrup , honey \) salt , garlic powder , jalapeno pepper , ground ginger , onion powder , habanero pepper , dried parsley , citric acid , cilantro extract , ginger oil , cayenne pepper , white pepper , lime oil br br new ingredients br potatoes , safflower and or sunflower oil , sugar , dried cane syrup , salt , maltodextrin , yeast extract , spices , garlic powder , onion powder , dried parsley , jalapeno powder , citric acid , natural flavors , lime extract br br i'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner , blue diamond they might want to get rid of great taste naturally from their bags as i do n't consider maltodextrin to be very natural br br great job kettle ! way to ruin a great thing ! . 
i was sent 3 week past fresh by date stock chips are noticeably not fresh in taste wo n't order again br br edit and just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it , black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat unfortunately i put a chip in my mouth before i saw the hole br br very bad form amazon . 
and that is the problem i order these by the case of 12 and when they are good , which is over half the time they are the best kettle chip , the best ! and then i get a case of the worse the potatos are mealy and old so i just throw them out and order again , expensive but when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best the last case is what prompted me to write this the potatos were weird like they were almost sour as in going bad and i even wrote the company that makes them so if you want the best kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are not the best try again ! br i , myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring . 
these chips are tasty but not what i expected from a low salt item they seem as salty as any regular potato chip , and they also seem excessively greasy by comparison , cape cod reduced fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy . 
yes , they are good however , they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff , which is initially satisfying then becomes too much and certainly is n't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues br br and the package ca n't be opened without a sharp implement i could n't pull it apart at the top as i am used to doing i do n't normally carry a knife or scissors and do n't have rodent teeth well , i was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key even then , the bag was wow thick and tough br br on the package it says these are krinkle cut chips turns out that means the corrugated kind , not what i wanted i do n't eat ripple ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth so this information is important br br these are good but so are other brands with which i do n't have these problems . 
miss vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available i'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and miss vickie 's are better imho . 
i want to like kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil \( which are both gmo , and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy \) , but darnit , these things bite back ! on the plus side , the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many on the minus side , a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it do they have to be so hard and crunchy \? what 's wrong with simply light and crispy \? i vastly prefer lay 's texture , but suffer with kettle due to the absense of gmos and corn soy i wish they 'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth , though . 
i am very disappointed with this product because i could not see how many calories it has at the time i ordered it i received it and now i can see it has 60 calories per tablespoon granulated sugar has only 45 calories per tablespoon how could agave nectar be better than sugar \? . 
i was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued kettle flavor , but was disappointed when i opened the box and found this substitution i am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor it is a very good bbq chip but i could get this flavor at the grocery store why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued \? \? \? the one star is for the substitution the country bbq is a 4 start chip , but not the chip i longed for . 
i guess there 's no telling what will tickle the palate i'm a huge tabasco fan , and i love unconventional snacks but these do n't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they 're made from i did n't find them to have much of a kick at all practically bland , in fact even with my strong aversion to wasting food , i had to throw out or give away most of the case do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12 . 
yeast extract is listed as an ingredient sounds harmless , right \? specifically , these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract , which is , on a chemical level , monosodium glutamate it 's just derived from a different source , but it has all the same toxic properties kettle still advertises their products as containing no msg while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with msg sensitivities . 
these were not flavorful enough for my taste it seems that all the seasoning falls off the chips and sinks to the bottom of the bag too bad , because i really liked the idea of a healthier potato chip i would not buy these again . 
i did not like these potatoe chips it 's hot , and sweet , with an overwhelming taste of garlic it 's also a bit salty . 
long story short these are very tasty we have purchased a number of flavors from this brand , this is my favorite br br but as noted by another reviewer these contain msg in the form of yeast extract br br it has become a popular means of hiding msg lately by calling it different things , as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what i consume i find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome br br also , the bag is not very large , but half of it is air this may well help in shipping , but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive . 
expiration date 1 13 smashed and stale edible , not real enjoyable for the price i paid , one of the best pretzel 's i had when br i purchased them from publix they stopped carrying them , i must find another addiction . 
unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously , i neglected to not look for the word supreme in this offer and since i was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered we \( that is my husband , guests and me \) knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed but , currently amazon featured the supreme babka and now i am awaiting to receive these in the future , i will read more carefully . 
i opened the can and immediately became concerned when i saw what looked like dried white crust , rather than fluffy frosting the package recommended stirring before use , so i gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo the best i can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in better of dead \( no raisins in it though ! \) br i tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it when lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knife br i opted for making my own frosting instead very easy ! a little sprectrum palm shortening , a lot of powdered sugar , a tiny splash of vanilla , a tiny bit of salt , and rice milk as needed for consistency , beat for 5 minutes , and i had the fluffy 'butter' cream frosting i thought i 'd get from cherrybrook br br i wonder if our can was overheated in the store \( whole foods \) or something br i 've read positive reviews of their frosting mix , so maybe i 'll try that next time . 
well , i opened it and it is grayish sticky mess i'm so mad at myself for wasting my money , and not trying to make it from scratch at home which would probably end up better and cheaper oh well , live and learn ! . 
i love cherrybrook kitchen and have tried almost all of their products i was excited to try the ready to spread frosting , as i do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting i am not a picky eater , especially if the item contains sugar but this was horrible ! the consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting it is not light and fluffy it is very gooey i cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey i did not even try it on a cake , because the taste and texture were so off putting seriously , do not waste your money ! . 
this product was such a disappointment ! as all the other reviewers said , it 's a gluey , sticky texture more akin to elmer 's glue than to an edible food product the flavor was sickening sweet i actually thought that the frosting had spoiled it was that bad ! save yourself the time and \( i paid 4 99 \) and make your own frosting or go with another brand cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good it 's hard to believe they even sell this . 
i am glad i found this on the reduced rack for 99c the taste was not bad but no way i could frost my cake it stuck to the knife , ran down in strings , what a mess i too thought i had gotten a bad batch my gds birthday cake looks like crap who would buy this mess horrible . 
i recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store now i know why it was on sale ! br br this is not a fluffy , creamy white frosting you 'd expect to find when opening the jar now , i was n't expecting it to be just like betty crocker , but it was pretty bad like others said , it is a gluey tacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on it reminds me of taffy that has n't quite hit the right stage in the candy making process the taste is n't that great either , and it 's sickeningly sweet \( even for frosting \) the only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns \? i still do n't think it would be the right consistency . 
i can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought it 's kind of generous to call it frosting , it has more the consistency of rubber cement and since we were in a time crunch , we did n't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting , so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it horrible experience , bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever it spread about as easily as chewing gum , stuck to everything it came in contact with , and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it on top of all this , it did n't even taste good by the time we were done decorating , we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family so we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre made cake our cake , which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey , was used as a centerpiece a really ugly centerpiece , that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried . 
a watered down perversion of the acai berry br br this juice comes on strong and harsh with tart aftertaste and no texture br br that 's because it is mostly apple juice , grape juice , pomegranate juice , blackberry juice , blueberry juice , and tart cherry juice oh yeah there is some acai berry juice mixed into this concoction br br you shall not find that distinctive smooth chocolaty acai flavor here there is no milky mouth pleasing texture neither for that exotic unique acai experience try zola or samzon brands br br i'm not saying that this lakewood juice product is n't nutritious that 's not my point i'm saying that it 's a juice blend that does not taste anything like the real acai juice . 
this product is made by annie 's inc in berkely , ca made in the usa the product maintains excellent organic integrity , and it is stored in 100 recycled paperboard packaging br br the manufacturers also support family farms use organic milk , butter , and yogurt the product takes approximately 10 min to prepare the product contains dairy and wheat , and it has been exposed to equipment that also processes egg and soy products br br the ingredients include organic whole wheat shell pasta , organic valley organic cheddar cheese \( organic cultured pasteurized milk , salt , non animal enzymes \) , organic whey , salt , and sodium phosphate br br this is a mildly flavored whole wheat macaroni cheese dinner this mac and cheese is a wonderful comfort food the pasta is firm , and it has an excellent flavor br br there are no artificial flavors , synthetics colors , or preservatives the pasta was produced without antibiotics , synthetic hormones , or persistent pesticides br br this pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture there are 2 5 servings per box \( 2 5 oz \) each serving contains 250 cal , 4 5 g fat , sat 2 g fat , 10 mg cholest , 570 mg sodium , 43 g carb , 5 g fiber , 6 g sugars , 9 g protein br br however , the cheese envelop is not exactly sufficient even when you add the butter , milk , or yogurt to add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese , you will have to add your own organic cheese br br the cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta i give this mac and cheese a 5 5 on packaging , 5 5 for maintain organic integrity , 5 5 on texture , and a 2 5 for flavor . 
my husband and i were very disappointed in this coffee , very weak , watery cup of coffee a definite waste of 13 00 . 
this item , werther's sugar free hard candy , if consumed , will give you or your friends , loose bowels i purchased 12 bags and discovered more than a bowel problem you ca n't return them need a laxative \? i have ten unopened bags you can have for free . 
this coffee is good but , for me , it 's nothing special i will buy it again because it 's a nice , mellow blend , and my favorite daily coffee , nabob , must now be shipped from canada however , on my first order to the canadian company , it 's taking a long time to be delivered \( still have n't gotten it \) br br the reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this kona coffee is actually only 15 kona if you look very carefully at the photo of the disc , you can see that information , and there 's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description so it 's my fault for not reading more carefully , but i was happy to see what i thought was 100 kona and was n't careful i 've bought the 15 kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the tassimo discs , but i just read the product title and ordered br br as i said , the coffee tastes good , the amount of coffee is the usual amount , neither the small cups of some european coffees or the extra large size , and i would recommend the coffee just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15 kona and do n't expect it to come in a flash , as it did when amazon prime delivered it . 
this kind of tea not good ! taste and smell so wear it 's not like tea , and feel like some thing chemical . 
the laddoos turned bad in a few days after we received it no other item inside our fridge turned bad . 
bought this at a local specialty item store because i adore chutney because of the higher price and being sold like a gourmet item i wrongly thought it would be better than the affordable brands sold at the supermarket wrong it is mostly gel \( jelly \) with a few fruits sprinkled throughout and tastes like cheap thickened jelly you put on sandwiches i 've had much better and that 's just talking about the supermarket brands very disappointed money does not buy quality . 
this is not disco dust which is edible and made for baking do not purchase this product for such purposes ! . 
i was very happy with the quick shipping as i needed it for a school product for my daughter but when it came in the roof was broken and the corner of the house was broken i could n't send it back as i needed for a project . 
this is n't as easy as it looks , does n't came with enough yellow frosting , and the frosting does n't stick very well my 5 year old did like making it though . 
i am a preschool teacher and do a g is for gingerbread unit every january i was on vacation during christmas and when i got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found which is odd i needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week i looked everywhere and could not find ont so i had one overnighted from amazon on nye and it came yesterday i pick this one because of the rudolph theme the gingerbread itself came broken like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken it 's non returnable i called amazon , they were nice enough to order me a second one since i spend a ton of money each year with them this one also came broken i order a lot from amazon and things do not come broken i think only one time have i had returned something because it was broken in 100 's of orders but two of the same thing in a row \? ! i think it 's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped i will say most come ups and overnight comes fed ed but it 's bubble wrapped very well i think the gingerbread is n't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off the rest of the kit is very cute the first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box but the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags too bad but i would try something else , stay away from this one . 
i was disappointed in this product because i thought it would be bigger br also , it did not come with enough icing i had to use my own . 
the whole idea of a spongebob ginger bread pineapple is really great , but the sticker that says use by has a 10 jn 16 date on it if thats 2010 this is not good ! i think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration , but my son is going to want to eat it the least the seller could do is to check the expiration date ! its right on the front of the box ! not happy at all ! ! ! . 
this tea carries the flavor one would expect from the smell terrible it invigorates like a puncture wound , and the only revival is that , after drinking , you discover that you are still alive br br well , one tea bag was enough for me my mother in law said , oh , that smells kind of like wine okay , kind of like wine , with a hint of rot and a moldy aftertaste if she likes it , she can have the whole box . 
if it were possible to give this product zero stars , i would have done so i am a huge fan of twinings teas , and was very excited to try this new blend after arriving home from the grocery , i immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner between sorting , washing , and chopping items , the hot water was added to the bag to steep preparation continued , until a distinctly off odor hit me i thought one of my ingredients must be rancid ! i hunted around for almost four minutes before i realized it was the tea even after cleaning up , and airing out the kitchen , my roommate later came in and asked about the smell save your money to purchase any other twinings product . 
of course , we all know how delicious ghirardelli chocolate is ! ! ! ! unfortunately , after i purchased two of these gift bags online , i found them in a local store for half the price lesson learned \? \? \? ! ! ! . 
are people really paying 10 bucks for these chocolates \? \? \? ummmm go to any grocery store and by them for 2 98 a bag wow . 
this was really a disappointment while the products included are fine , the real disappointment was the travel mug it is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it ! so it is basically just a cookie package ! yeah , that is really what i want to use as a travel mug i agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store the product description says the polka dot tumbler is definitely a keeper what \? it is simply cheap packaging ! not something of quality to enjoy had i known that i would not have purchased the set i really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis i like the products inside and the basket is ok , but really this what not what it appeared to be . 
it looks pretty , but the contents are very minute and seem to not be of very high quality there 's a plastic cup for the tea that looks like it came from a dollar store the basket is nice , though . 
trident strawberry twist sugarless gum is very disappointing , both in taste and consistency the strawberry flavor is very artificial tasting and , though i guess it is a good thing , not very long lasting the gum also gets stringy fairly quickly br br i chew a lot of gum , but will not be buying this flavor again br br not recommended ! br br cfh . 
besides that mentioned in the title , the only other remarks i have about it is the price is hard to beat , the taste is akin to a flintstone strawberry vitamin \( for those of you that have tasted them \) , and taste lasts for not very long i 'd say , on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a 3 also , the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time . 
the us made version of this cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the uk version of the chocolate which i have been eating since childhood i did not like this new taste to all my friends from india buy this chocolate if it is either made in uk or india otherwise you will be disappointed as i was . 
cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured new zealand is uses more cream than australia , etc this version by hershey is not what you expect from england , australia or new zealand cadbury it does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently br br if you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non hershey version br br hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality cadbury chocolate to usa . 
the taste is harsh as it is a lesser grade of yunnan it is ok to drink , but not to really enjoy i only make it for when i am in the hurry and will not be able to fully enjoy my tea anyway . 
to my mind , a fine caramel should be creamy and melting these are grainy the flavor on these was fine , although a little sweet to my taste . 
not my idea of a good caramel flavors of ginger and pistachio dominated same for the chocolate walnut and orange honey varieties i missed the mix of rich , buttery , dairy flavor with caramelized sugar that i expect in caramels . 
if you are concerned with an aluminum free product , then this is the product for you too bad that baking soda does not in any form contain aluminum this is , however a concern for baking powder which can , depending on manufacturer , contain aluminum save your hard earned money and buy bob 's red mill regular baking soda arm hammer is great for general cleaning purposes , but for natural beauty and health care , this brand is perfect br br just thought you 'd all like to know i almost fell for it myself until i did a little digging around \) br br p s so as not to let all of amazon com land feel i am one of those haters who do n't really know what they 're talking about , i love bob 's red mill co and shall continue purchasing their excellent products . 
i ca n't eat these oats , they have a funny taste to them my kids also think they taste funny my husband thinks they are ok , so he has 50 pounds of oats to eat on his own ! . 
the chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with oneanother the product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting japan . 
i think the pocky did not get stored rightly the chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick , and does n't taste as it should many of them stick together , and whenever i want to split them up , it just becomes very messy now i need to clean up my desk every time after i have it . 
the individual pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped . 
this product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packaging award the box only contains 5 bars and the wrappers are smaller than normal , so at least 50 of the interior of the box is air then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60 the length of a normal snack bar the rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper if they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25 of the space inside the box br br as far as taste goes they are so so on the dry side with a hint of berry flavor celiacs , who are used to inferior products , wo n't be disappointed in the taste of this one br br i 've also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging the picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie but when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter br br i really want to like this company they seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process that is why i 've continued to try their products i bought their granola many times , always wanting to like it , but it is some of the worst food i 've ever had the clusters are hard as the partially popped kernels at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for gerbils than people br br all in all i would not recommend enjoy life foods . 
i have recently stopped eating a number of allergens \( dairy , soy , nuts \) and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions unfortunately , these were pretty gross miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry i threw them away i would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free . 
my daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant toddler and we bought these bars consistently she still has the nut and egg allergy so i like that i can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars \( all varieties \) they have been hard as a rock and my daughter wo n't eat them i have tried them myself and thought i might break a tooth i had them on subscribe and save which i have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat i agree with a previous post i want to love these bars and i love everything the company stands for \( and actually really like their cookies \) , but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing i hope they address the issue and i will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture a total bummer they were better in the past but something changed with the taste , along with their new packaging ! ! . 
i was extremely disappionted when i opened my shipment of enjoy life on the go bars \( very berry , carmel apple , and cocoa loco \) the boxes are now a plain , generic design you know , the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper i then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes i still had at home guess what \? ! cheaper ingredients ! next , i taste tested , and let my 3 year old help he would n't eat the new ones and i ca n't blame him they are oily and bland i thought enjoy life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good tasting product i was wrong in summary , these are way too expensive to be made with low quality , unpalatable ingredients . 
refer to the picture i posted above the bar is half the size you think it is going to be it is literally a two bite bar very deceptive advertising that and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star my 10 year old son ate one and did n't like them i ate one and agreed as did my husband could n't give it away ! everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as i'm concerned . 
they are ok , but my husband only eats them when we are in car we keep them there for a celiac snack \( hard to find when roaming around \) he wo n't eat them otherwise they are definitely raspberry , but are kind of dry br we have never tried any other snack bars , so in all honesty they may be the norm i do n't know br we do like enjoy life 's other products br they are gf , have no msg or related products or aspartates . 
imagine taking some kids' playground chalk , perhaps that tan colored one and grinding it into powder with plenty of chunks then scoop it up and put it in your mouth br br that 's how disgusting this bar is br br i have no idea how and who is rating this as flavorful , it has none i 've done nutritional coaching for 30 years and watched healthy foods progress from painfully bad to barely edible to excellent br br this neanderthal era gluten free bar is so bad i want to go to my local grocery store , take all the boxes off off the shelf and hide them in a different part of the store \( perhaps , if there 's a trash compactor \? \) just to protect people from the experience my daughter had with this product br br save your money for these ridiculously expensive and spend it on anything else br br enjoy life bars \? being ill is better than putting this garbage in your mouth . 
the first ball worked pretty well , it just looked a little beaten up since then , half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water \( all of them do after sitting for a bit \) if you do n't mind the rate of failure , the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being steeped for a long time \( especially considering that it is white tea \) . 
both our twins love this one right from the start but it 's not loaded with lentils \( see ingredients below \) we introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they 're 10 months i'm glad they are eating something green because we could n't get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at 7 months , but we got them to eat the peas later at 9 months br br their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and we 've also tried sweet potato with cinnamon they love all the fruit varieties br br i'm glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein , although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredients br br this one also has carrots and i 've heard all babies like carrots i do n't know if they would like it without the carrots i have n't seen this one lentils and brown rice in our local stores , so i'm glad to get it here along with some others , we get this one with the subscription of course , with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and we 're so busy that it 's great to get these delivered br br the packaging is excellent i 've ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive broken br br ingredients per label water , organic apples , organic carrots , organic brown rice , organic lentils , organic canola oil br br this has 70 calories , 10 protein , 100 vitamin a , 4 vitamin c , 2 calcium and 4 iron br br i'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult . 
i liked getting this one for my twin 10 month olds because it has such interesting ingredients , particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans i like the fact that it 's vegetarian yet i believe it has a complete protein since it also has brown rice this list of ingredients looks excellent and it 's a green color naturally br br the babies liked it they have liked everything that has carrots br br i have the subscription for this one as i really like the ingredients and the fact that i'm giving the babies food that is naturally green br br ingredients per the label water , organic corn , organic zucchini , organic green beans , organic brown rice , organic carrots , organic garbanzo beans , organic canola oil br br this has 70 calories , 8 protein , 40 vitamin a , 10 vitamin c , 2 calcium and 2 iron i 've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult . 
earth 's best turkey vegetable dinner hits the spot with apples with turkey you can add cranberries if you want to take it to the next level i just ca n't find non sweetened and non dried cranberries even at the better food stores br br apples , carrots and turkey taste good to my 10 month old growing twin girls babies love carrots since they 're sweet to their taste , so that made a great addition the whole barley flour absorbs the water to give it an acceptable consistency br br the ingredients per the label water , organic apples , organic carrots , mechanically separated organic turkey , organic whole barley flour br br in addition to 12 protein and 50 vitamin a , it has 6 calcium and 4 iron br br i'm very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through earth 's best i 've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult . 
wow , i am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the jars the other posters say they notified earth 's best about this in august and they are still selling it without checking or recalling ! ! no more earth 's best for my little guy i am taking my business elsewhere and i am very sad that organic company is selling baby food with plastic and bpa in their jars they gotta do better than this to get my business . 
would be a quality product if it were n't so thin nearly the consistency of soup it just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be . 
my triplets will not eat this , eventhe one who will eat anything the consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon . 
my baby loves sweet potatoes i can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what i wanted to mix in there it was horribly runny , like spooning formula into his mouth ick . 
i normally love earth 's best products \( as does my son \) however , tonight after i 'd given him half the jar i thought i would try some since it was a new flavor and i realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it i was appalled ! as this is my first child and i do n't have any experience with this kind of thing , i called poison control they said he would be ok and once i knew he was fine , i got really angry i looked it up online and found that earth 's best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it do n't buy earth 's best ! really disappointing . 
i introduced my daughter to earth 's best organic turkey vegetable dinner at 4 months a bit early , but she 's advanced , as she was 6 weeks overdue she loved it at first but , i bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite i 've tried some of it as well of all of them , this is also my least favorite . 
we received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today i always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature \( i put them in a bowl and microwave for 6 9 seconds \) and taste ok when i tasted this , i made a face because it was so yucky ! i added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon to her credit , my \( 8 month old \) daughter ate some bites , but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors i like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein . 
only three jars came in a form edible to babies the rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water it also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture br pretty disappointing and a waste of money . 
little baby picky will only eat this sometimes this one is more watery than the others , so keep that in mind reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different , so i hope letting you know the consistency and texture help . 
to be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible up all night screaming from gas pains garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies . 
i usually make my baby 's food it 's so easy , steam fruits veggies and puree but sometimes i do n't have enough time to cook and i buy earth 's best baby foods baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but did n't like this one she refused to eat it when i tried it i understood why , i would n't eat it myself either it tastes nasty my poor baby immediately i made her a homemade potato , zucchini , asparagus puree and she loved it i would n't recommend this flavor ! . 
this is my daughter 's most favorite baby food by far this is the only ones she 'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds however , the taste is very bland , for me as an adult at least after you put the unfinished portion in the fridge , it may become sort of watery at which point i throw it out it is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has , especially zucchini br i had to update my review today , because i saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food plastic in baby food \? i notified earth 's best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing , but i am not giving my baby this food any more , even though she likes it , that 's it for us . 
i just wanted to post here that i found small bits of plastic in this food as i was feeding my 9 month old plastic ! ! ! in food ! ! ! ! baby food ! ! ! so please be careful if you buy this or are considering it br br my daughter loves this food it 's actually her favorite this is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over 2 months . 
i first tasted sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it so i started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form after several weeks of investigation i called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea i was told is was pappy 's sassafras concentrate i looked online and found it at amazon com as i was ordering it i also saw the sassafras teabags i thought i 'd order a box to try i was very dissapointed it did n't taste like the flat rootbeer i was expecting it was more like black licorice , which i hate , with a very mild rootbeer undertone it also did n't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root br br i 've never had real sassafras tea made with the root so i do n't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not bottom line i wo n't buy the teabags again . 
i did not care for this product at all , i thought it was the same tea my sisters and i use to drink when we were in elementary school i found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree . 
i purchased this because i read that it was a natural cure for hives um , how about not it did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful luckily , a co worker of mine loves this stuff \( reminds him of his grandmother \) and i gave it to him yucky , yucky stuff . 
these are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety , which can be hard to find br br one thing to keep in mind though , is the expiration or best by date for example , if you order these in april and the batch you receive has a june use by date , it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you since they 're roasted in oil and unsalted , these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety , even if refrigerated upon receipt br br amazon does n't seem to specify use by dates for the food products they sell , so it 's a gamble for the purchaser i'm assuming that amazon wo n't ship stuff that has expired , but they probably ship out the oldest stock first , and the use by date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice . 
i purchased this for a friend who loves to cook only to find out that i paid 3 times more than what i should be 13 95 for 4 cans is highway robbery now that i know that i can purchase one can for around 1 09 now as far as the item itself , this brand of panang paste is excellent the beef panang dish my friend made using this paste was as good as the ones in the thai restaurant i would recommend the paste but not the price . 
omg i would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal degusting is n't even a strong enough word a horrible horrible mistake an expensive mistake they advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why i bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when i just wanted plan peanut butter cookies however when i received them i found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but i thought okay i 'll try them and omg i almost threw up from the taste horrible , horrible , disgutingly , medicinal taste do not buy ! ! ! if they had a zero before the stars i would rate it a zero instead of 1 star . 
not hot at all like the other low star reviewer , i got suckered by seeing 'habenero' in the name and the 12 oz size some people might like the flavor , citrus y and it has some fish sauce in the mix \( according to the ingredient label \) , but if you 're looking for hot this ai n't it . 
i have to admit , i was a sucker for the large quantity , 12 oz , when shopping for hot sauces but now seeing the size of the bottle , it reminds of wing sauce bottle sizes plastic bottle it does have a convenient squirt top but overall , not very hot or tasty , and made mostly from jalape ntilde os if i had seen the ingredients list i would not have bought it br jalapenos br water br vinegar br brown sugar br lime juice br fish sauce br cilantro br habanero br garlic br spice blend br salt br potassium sorbate br xanthan gum . 
these little animal crackers taste good my doggies like them , but i wo n't be buying again they are like the human animal crackers have flour sugar other bad stuff for dogs i will continue to buy the healthy treats for my doggies which they also love without sugar you might want to try wellness , blue buffalo , natural balance , zukes , just to name a few . 
the smell at first was just like a bed of fresh roses even though the rose content is very minimal i found the smell overwhelming i did not like that this brand of spices does not have a seal in place and only a loosely screwed on lid there is no shaker lid either you open it and it dumps i am questioning how only a few minute pieces of roses could produce such a perfume odor i hope it is not chemically enhanced with the lid being loose and not sealed i have doubts about the safety of the product . 
i was hoping these were more true caramels , not caramel flavored truffles , but they 're still delicious would definitely order them again , and maybe extra for gifts the salt just makes them extra amazing br br bummer about the shipping shipping on this item is reasonable , but we bought the chocolate covered pretzels at the same time , and shipping was charged for both items even though they arrived in the same box there was n't even anything fancy about the packaging ! br br edit okay , these actually bother my stomach a little after one truffle the package was n't shipped with an ingredients list , and i had to go to the company site directly and find a well hidden and hard to follow ingredients page to discover there 's a lot of shady ingredients , including high fructose corn syrup for 40 a box , i expect no corn syrup i also do n't expect propylene glycol \( antifreeze \) in vanilla , which i expect to be 100 vanilla beans , and not artificial vanillin \( which sometimes comes from the anal glands of beavers \) i'm disappointed in the ingredient quality br br http www premiumchocolatiers com ingredient info php br br review goes from 5 stars to 3 i 'd make it 2 , but the extra star is because they are quite delicious . 
ive been craving some deer jerky for a while so i gave this one and some others on amazon a try this one was very sinue and a little too sweet for my taste not going to buy again im still on my search for the salty dry version im after . 
the noodles in the box were all broken the sauce was over salted and did not have a good flavor i threw out most of the skillet i would recommend not purchasing this product . 
on a trip to italy , muesli is what all the hotels had for breakfast as their cold cereal and i loved it imagine how excited i was when i saw that kellog 's sold this product what did i learn \? despite the similar name , this cereal is quite unlike european style muesli while the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar , this cereal is mostly a flake cereal , while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all br br real muesli is made of rolled \( not flaked \) grains this has pluses and minuses on the plus side , milk does not turn european mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals on the minus side , european mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so \( i e while you are in the shower , or while the coffee is brewing \) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side for those that are concerned about eating processed foods , rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones \( rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted flaked grains are fully steam cooked until they are mush , pressed into flakes , fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend time to mushiness \) and certainly only the kellog 's product contains hfcs br br you owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from amazon \( or better yet , single boxes from a local health foods store if you have one \) and see what you prefer i eat the bob 's red mill product available on amazon \( and one of my local grocery chains \) instead of this , and am much more satisfied i have n't tried familia \( but i'm not crazy about the idea of the fruit flakes \) , and the dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me the other products are a hair more expensive than the kellog 's , but i'm willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product br br i'm surprised quaker does n't sell a muesli product given that they have to be the largest producer of rolled grains in the u s , you 'd think it would be a natural fit for them . 
recently purchased this cereal assuming it would contain nothing but healthy ingredients , then i read the label and discovered it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup . 
i really like the mueslix cereal , but the amazon price is awful br 22 73 for a 5 pack is over 4 50 a box br this product retails in the stores here for around 4 a box \( publix , kroger , ingles \) br so the amazon price is higher than retail br br mueslix is almost never on sale though , unlike other kellogg 's cereals br 1 2 times per year , publix grocery has all kellogg 's cereals for half price br 2 box is an incredible price and we stock up for the next several weeks br br i expected the amazon price to be more like 3 box , since it was a 5 pack br but boy was i wrong . 
it 's no secret that high fructose corn syrup is detrimental to your health unfortunately , it 's also no secret that it has replaced other forms of sugar in a disturbingly large number of manufactured foods even worse is that most high fructose corn syrup is made from genetically modified corn br br since the late 1980s , hfcs has replaced regular table sugar , honey , and similar sweeteners in practically everything prolonged consumption of hfcs is now the topic of much debate and we are learning that it can cause long term damage to the body br high fructose corn syrup dangers br br 1 significant risk of weight gain obesity br 2 increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes br 3 hypertension and elevated bad cholesterol levels br 4 long term liver damage br 5 mercury exposure from hfcs br br kelloggs and other manufacturers know this and are slowly getting rid of this sweetner look at the cover of post rain bran they are advertising that it contains no high fructose corn syrup i applaud them for this high fructose corn syrup is made from genetically modified corn from monsanto which uses systemic pesticides in their seeds which is causing colony collapse disorder in bees i am a bee keeper and have been avoiding all products with hfcs in them to save my family and the bees watch vanishing of the bees , food matters and food inc they are all sold on amazon excellent movies which will change your health dramatically and the way you think and eat . 
i bought the liter size bottles of this dressing on amazon , so i am assuming they are the same since they have the same name and the nutritional facts are identical this dressing is definitely too sweet for my taste my wife agrees otherwise very good i use it on tossed salads only . 
coffee beans did not seem fresh no oil on them what so ever i have tasted much better and fresher will not order again . 
tossed this out after trying it texture and taste were far below expectations seemed kind of mushy and pasty pricy to boot . 
they claim this product is unadulterated , which would make you think oh ! sweet ! it 's going to be the best , because nobody else 's coconut oil says it 's unadulterated i checked out their website , and for those of you who do n't know you want to go for cold pressed oils if they 're not cold pressed , it means they 've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats , which as anything goes , can and usually does , kill any good minerals and vitamins their site posts information on their extraction process as of today , this is what it states br br manila coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary , state of the art mechanical expeller \( manila virginflo \) , thermo stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible \( 0 1 \) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press induced , without chemical solvents , no bleaching , no deodorizing , no hydrogenation , no fermentation enzymes to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste this method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high \( up to 170 degrees celsius \) heat temperatures br br mechanical expeller is their form of extraction and they also say it sustains unique character blah blah blah when subjected to high heat temperatures therefore , in my personal opinion , it is not as unadulterated as their information on their products on amazon make them sound i will be steering clear of their products br br i'm sorry if my review offends some , but if you 're going to pay good money for something , you should know about it i would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one i was looking for larger quantities , which is why i looked at this product , however i will be sticking with nutiva as their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open the information below is direct from their website br br what makes nutiva 's virgin coconut oil so special \? much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed within several hours of the coconuts being chopped , the meat is cold pressed , unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing nutiva 's approach preserves as much of the oil 's natural color , flavor and aroma , giving you the best results for any use br br if you do n't care about how it 's processed , it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils if you want to read some scary things , look up the dark information on how those are processed yuck ! talk about horrifying br br thank you for your time br amy br br ps i used to be one of those organic \? what kind of fruitcake are you \? think you 're more special than anybody else \? people but i have learned so much in the past year and a half , dealing with my son 's allergies and intollerances there 's more to it than oh it 's more expensive , so it 's just making me feel special because i can afford it no there 's way more to it than that i urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods it 's a way of life , a healthier way of life we all deserve to live healthier if you live healthier , even though it costs more , in the long term you 're saving money because you are healthier so that means less doctor visits , less expensive \( and nasty harmful \) medications , etc . 
i was expecting to receive only starburst when i received this it was half skittles which i did not want or need i needed only starburst next time i will just go to the store . 
the good br br walker shortbread cookies are my favorite , i love them i bought the highlanders and each set of cookies came individually wrapped with two cookies each if this were the end of it , a five star review br br the bad br br unfortunately , amazon shipped them in a box that was about the same size as the container they came in from the walkers cookie company after ups was through with the shipment , my cookies were reduced to crumbs i contacted amazon about this problem without ever receiving a response since i bought these shipped and sold by amazon , i wo n't be purchasing these cookies from amazon again . 
my cookies were in such tiny broken pieces , they were useless upon complaint , a second mailing arrived several weeks later the cookies were again in crumbs the cookies were packed in a box with a pitiful single air bubble i gave this feedback and expected some effort to improve on the packing but no , same packaging , same useless cookies having enjoyed these highlanders in the past , it was both a disappointment and a big waste of money . 
it 's a good idea to have raw sugar type cubes , but this was 3x the cost of granulated raw sugar . 
i purchased this product because of its name , rumford naturals corn starch \( the word naturals appears large and clear on the pictured product label \) also , the amazon description said it was made from non genetically modified corn the label on the product that i actually received does not say rumford naturals , but it is still made with non genetically modified corn i say made with because this product now contains more than one ingredient its ingredients are cornstarch , calcium sulfate , and one of the suggested servings \( 1 tblsp \) contains 15 of the daily value of calcium that makes this product potentially a good source for dietary calcium supplementation on the other hand , for persons who must restrict their calcium intake \( example , some persons with kidney stones \) , it can pose a potential problem , even danger amazon provides themselves with a nice out for this they list the following legal disclaimer actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website we recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels , warnings , and directions before using or consuming a product but , it is not fair for amazon to not at least list the correct ingredients and photo of the package so that you do not have to order the product in order to read labels and find out what you have purchased br br i will not buy this product again br because i do n't need extra calcium br because i do n't believe that the calcium sulfate was added out of interest in the consumer 's health br but to make the product cheaper to produce so it can be priced competitively with other brands br and still be touted as having been made from with non genetically modified corn br and just on principal because i ca n't afford to throw it away and did not want the hassle of returning it br br i am very , very displeased with amazon 's incorrect listing of the product , which was brought to their attention when i purchased it in february 2012 , and so far nothing has been done br br although calcium sulfate is considered a safe food additive it is basically the same thing as plaster of paris and , if you use too much of this product \( basically the same amount as i had previous used of pure corn starch \) , the very stiff sediment in the bottom of the cooking container \( i make pudding in pyrex in a microwave and usually stir it only every 30 seconds \) will remind you of damp plaster ! . 
was really bummed to find out that these chocolates had melted before they got to my daughter for her bday seems that they should not be sold online if there is not a way to keep them 'safe' \( . 
all my fault i thought this would be a carton of 3 boxes of cereal instead it was 1 box of cereal for 12 99 who sells cereal for this price plus 8 00 shipping \? i feel stupid ! buyer beware ! . 
this is not jerky , this is processed , hard like a rock , very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you ca n't break into anything smaller than 2 inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat ! the dogs 45lb dogs that will eat anything were not impressed , it was hard to chew , and it sounded like they were crunching rocks , most of them spat it out after a few chews , left it there , this would be the first time they would not eat something in their entire lives , these dogs will work for lettuce where is a zero star button \? . 
i ordered both the beef and turkey flavors my dogs would not even take these in their mouths both flavors were very dry and had no real aroma to them try a small quantity first i donated the entire order to the humane society . 
this does not reflect on the product but my shi tzus took them and left them laying on the carpet normally with chicken or turkey snacks , they go nuts i donated both containers to the humane society i 'd try a smaller quantity for a first order .

i originally ordered two teas from art of tea the silver needles and the coconut creme when my package came in , they had shipped the coconut creme and mistakenly bundled it with this mandarin silk tea by accident i contacted amazon and they refunded the silver needles and told me i could dispose of the mandarin silk oolong as i saw fit well , since i'm never one to turn down tea , i chose to dispose of it by , well , drinking it br br this is n't a bad tea , first off i do n't have too much experience with oolongs , but i do like the flavor of this however , i do n't taste too much of the mandarin it almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea , and it has a similar light green yellow color i drink it with a little honey br br all in all , it 's a decent tea i do n't think i 'll order it again , but i 'll certainly finish off this tin . 
4 bags of chips were open when i received the shipment i am hoping that the chips were br blew open during shipment in flight no more chips for me through amazon otherwise , br the chips are good to eat and very salty . 
we have ordered uncle rays bbq chips many times before always been pleased , except this order ! just not the same br seasoning as usual generally lacked much for taste ! not sure if they have reduced the seasoning , in their processing \? but out of case we bought , we have opened and thrown away 3 bags already , very disappointed with this order ! . 
i have loved ketchup flavored potato chips since i was a kid and spent my summers at my grandparents in canada this is a very popular flavor there and seems to be always available i recently got back from a trip to montreal , where i ate at least a pack a day i decided i really wanted some around and was happy when i found these on amazon unfortunately , the flavor is nowhere close to the brands i 've tried before there 's a sort of smoky , barbeque sauce thing going on not that they 're as good as bbq potato chips \( which i love \) , they just do n't taste like ketchup i tried to get through a bag over a couple of weeks to see if they would grow on me , then just threw them all out yuck ! . 
after reading all the good reviews on these chips i have to admit i was disappointed perhaps i just ended up with a bad batch , but i could barely taste the vinegar and there seemed to be far too many burnt \( and i mean black \) chips in these bags hopefully the other flavors are better , but i'm going to stick with other brands from now on . 
these had heat and had good enough coating of the seasoning the first 2 cases were amazing best i had ever then they restocked and tried 4 5 cases and they taste either like plain chips or slight hint of seasoning on them what a shame they seemed to cut back on quality to save money bad uncle ray ! . 
the flavor combination of the ketchup chips was very good however , the coating was applied so heavily that the chips were gritty , and thickly encrusted with it the flavoring grit coated my lips and mouth with grit and crumbled and fell off all over my clothes messy and unpleasant needs lighter flavor coating . 
the uncle ray 's bbq potato chips are comparable to lays or most commonly available chips in local markets the bbq spice ia a bit too much the one pound bags consisted of about half broken chips i wo n't think about buying these again , even with the discounted price and will pay a bit more for a much better kettle fried potato chip . 
bought uncle ray 's wavy 's 16 oz potato chips because purchased uncle ray 's 16 oz barbque potato chips in the past and was very pleased oh how wrong we were do not purchase the wavy 's chips ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! they are the quality of buying a no name bag of chips from a roadside service station store broken , brown , very poor quality very , very disappointed do not do not do not purchase uncle ray 's 16 oz wavy potato chips br br october 03 , 2012 br br bought uncle ray 's sour cream and onion flavored chips for the 5th shipment with extreme disappointment the other \( 4 \) four shipments were very good which is why we continued to buy this flavor br br the additive that when you like an item and start to buy a lot , it will change for the worse is proving to be true for us this shipment of chips are awful bags are extremely deflated , so was expecting to be stale however , was not so cannot not explain the semi flat bags chips seem to be the bottom of the barrel flakes you know when you try to salt your food and the top comes off , the seasoning on these chips is like that it appears that the top came off a full bottle or these are the bottom of the barrel crumbled chips where the seasoning has covered the chips too , too much we just opened \( 3 \) three bags just now because the first bags was awful , opened second bag awful , opened 3rd bag also was awful left with 6 more , probably not edible , bags the chips really appear to be the not so fresh , burned bottom of the barrel , get rid of leftovers very , very , disappointed will not buy again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . 
just in case , if anyone does n't know what white tea is , as opposed to green or black , let 's quote wikipedia white tea is fast dried , while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan \( while kept moving for even curing \) oolong and black teas are fermented before curing what does it mean \? for me , it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day objectively and scientifically speaking , white tea is said to have more anti oxidants and less caffeine so , in my view , it 's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties br br this particular product , while it comes in tea bags , it 's not exactly your 'supermarket' variety unlike the cheap teas , black , green , herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags , the 'choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped , biodegradable , nylon like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves , not some indistinct crushed powder br br this being a white tea , 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case i found the added flowers to be a little too strong , bordering to overpowering for my taste the lychee and osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste think of sweet , green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma if it 's not 'love at the first sip' , give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors or not br br ingredients br br organic , fair trade certified white tea br natural lychee flavor br organic osmanthus flavor br contains caffeine br br the somewhat off balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer time will tell but at this time 3 stars \( meaning 'it 's okay' \) seem to be the fair rating . 
be careful ! i ordered a pack of 6 , my invoice says pack of 6 , but i received only 1 stick . 
even though the item says pack of 6 , i only received one i called them up to see where the other 5 were , and they said that amazon put it incorrectly seriously \? \? they are issuing a refund , but still i wanted 6 , which is what the item says , and instead and only getting the 1 should we just not trust what 's on amazon now \? \? \? . 
as the ingredients contained in this food are not the optimal food sources essential to a cat 's well being , i do n't actually feed my cats this dry food br br corn is the first ingredient , which is a food my cats really do n't crave there is a meat source as the second ingredient , but unfortunately , it is a by product although there are a couple of other meat sources listed in the ingredients , the addition of artificial preservatives and coloring make this cat food a less than desirable food staple for any cat br br however , the amazon price is good and with amazon prime 2 day free shipping directly to work , this is a very convenient food for the shop cats i feed while the ingredients are n't the best , feeding it along with canned food , it is a balanced diet and seems to keep the shop cats healthy . 
my cat will not eat this food i do n't know why , but it was a waste of money i was looking for something cheap so i guess you get what you pay for . 
i like the fact that this vanilla flavor has no alcohol in it so i could add it to my baby 's pancakes it does not taste the same to me as the regular stuff it is rather bland in my opinion . 
i just received these bricks today and was very disappointed to find that both of the bricks were broken and unusable as a serving cooking plate they were busted completed in half they were packaged in one sleeve of small bubble wrap in a shallow box with no other protection or packaging in the box i went online to try and return them and they are not eligible for return this is the first return i 've ever tried to do in over 7 years of purchasing items off of amazon \( to the tune of several orders a month ! \) and yet the one time that i want to return a defective product , i ca n't do it i will be much more careful about what is eligible for returns and what is n't in the future . 
items in this gift basket was delivered to people who called me to say could not eat any of it , because everything was old and stale i was sad and disappointed time and effort , as well as money to get this , only to find out terrible . 
very disappointed with purchase the dates were so dried up where it tasted like leather instead of dates must have been sitting there for a long long time . 
i ordered three of the trays \( being a date nut \) and found that two were old or stale i admit to not checking the out of date on the exterior package , but still dried out fruit \? ! the last tray was fresher , but the experience was soured at that point i'm disappointed .

this tea is a new flavor of black tea by tazo it 's better than some other brands but not even close to being as good as their old flavor of black tea with citrus \( which they took off the market \) i do n't think this tea is worth sending away for because you can buy it locally in most grocery stores . 
this vendor is unscrupulous she ripped off her cultures from other collectors and shamelessly claims them as her own she has no conscience and i would highly recommend that you do your purchasing elsewhere . 
after searching for a more constant and less expensive supply of real licorice over my favorite \( more about that later \) , i decided to try this one based upon other reviews and the description i have to say that i was disappointed it is not intense enough and a bit too salty for my preference since all that i noticed was salt and more salt until it got down to the licorice flavor which i would charactize as modest my all time favorite licorice was discovered years ago while visiting a st louis mall has been and remains an excellent choice made by bissinger 's chocolate company and they call it french long licorice it is not noticeably salty and packed with flavor without being a sicky sweet candy i say that and caution licorice lovers to know their favorite type of licorice this is important when reading reviews and purchasing i was looking for something not american style junk candy , with actual licorice extract not anise , chewy , lasting , with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtones br br as far a bissinger 's is concerned , they do not make this licorice year round nor advertise it on their website or in their catalogs so you have to call their toll free number and ask if it has been in production it is expensive but well worth it for excellent flavor and lasting ability \( i can enjoy one for at least 15 minutes if i do n't chew \) these are my favorite thing to have when reading a great book and i limit myself to 2 at a sitting for my fix okay , sometimes 3 if it is a superb book d br the last time i ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thank you for being a customer that troubled to find their particular product because i do not live near one of their stores and unless i visit say st louis \( where it is headquartered \) i have to mail order anyway , i prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when i get an order \( 56 for 2lbs \) i leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off that makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference it frezes without problems so i will just have to go back to that and pay for my pleasure and stock up \) licorice gotta have it ! . 
i do n't know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime , but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough . 
this was a disappointment i use other products from this line manufacturer on a regular basis i bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid stevia in my purse the first time i went to use it , the liquid was a dark color almost black and i had to throw out the latte i was trying to sweeten all the manufacturer 's other liquid products are clear , and , in fact , this is titled clear liquid it must have been outdated spoiled i had already thrown the packing out , so do n't know how it was dated i tried calling the amazon supplier , but the call rolled into voice mail it 's not enough money to spend time following up , but it was disappointing . 
cans are lined w material that contains bpa which means the effort to grow the tomatoes organically was a waste of time br br 12 5 10 i did n't see the liner when i opened a different can from the same case i'm scratching my head . 
i ordered these lollipops for a friends wizard of oz themed shower the arrived packaged well but i noticed the box said they 're from oriental trading company if i wanted a cheap product that i knew was low quality and from china then i would have bought them directly from their site at 7 for 38 of them ! ! ! however , from the picture these looked well made the picture is very deceiving and so is the description they show 16 same colored lollipops mine came in a variety of colors they also gave dimentions that the lollipops were 6 x2 i noticed they looked a bit small and when i measured they did n't even come to 5 long , not any of them even though they 're all differnet lengths this was very disappointing since i planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops overall , i'm very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product they 're providing to consumers . 
i purchased these to give to children who come to my place of business when they arrived , it says clearly on the back of the individual wrapper made in china no way i'm giving these to children if they were manufactured in china , following the whole poisoned pet food debacle the fact that these are made in china needs to be highlighted much more clearly . 
i ordered 48 lollipops to use as party favors only to be disappointed that the front and back of the candy had writing on it so i rewrapped them using clear bags purchased from michaels also a few were cracked or broken , so luckily i ordered more than enough unwrapped they are so adorable ! . 
i purchased these for my candy buffet at my wedding and i'm not impressed at all i could have saved money by ordering them directly from oriental trading company which is clearly where they came from they look cheap and they 're not as colorful as shown in the picture the oriental trading company information is on the back of the wrappers on the lollipops most of the lollipop sticks are bent and two lollipops arrived broken the box only has 12 lollipops , but in the description it says there 's 16 i would have expected that if i knew they were coming from oriental trading company , but that 's not in the description , so i feel ripped off . 
these lollipops are not as pictured they came in assorted colors , some really drab , not the rainbow brights shown in the picture they are also completely flat rather than being the rolled old fashioned candy style so they look cheap i need them for a birthday party and i was really disappointed when i received them . 
i opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke , i was very disappointed they did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking you are better off buying them from a store around your area . 
this muffin mix is awful , all you taste is flour and sour cream , which is used to make these it just tastes wierd i 've tried and tried , br there are no good tasting low carb treats , esp for diabetics . 
these are tiny packets i bought them thinking they were the regular size and are not my kids love the product , but this particular package was outrageously expensive for tiny packages i sent them back . 
for christmas i ordered some coupons from my daughters school for 30 00 off ohama steaks i was excited to try them as i have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and i was ready to test them out i went on line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them i made my choice and fell for some of the last min add ons , by choice i went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time , having 2 for 15 00 i naturally thought i was getting 30 00 off the total with that said i was still willing to go ahead with the order 129 00 later i had ordered one of the package deals and the add ons i received my order ups in 5 7 days packaged in a styro cooler packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks i am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week , so i know a little about meat , and how to cook it first this is not high end dry aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher the steaks are about 30 00 a pound after shipping and the high prices the hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry i am so disappointed in the quantity and quality , i really have no words to describe how disappointed i am with this whole deal to top everything off i received a e mail coupon for 20 00 off my next order so the coupon that i purchased was 5 00 more than on line deals wow do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store ! ! ! . 
these are actually pretty good little potato puffs , and best of all no cheese ! \( unless you like that sort of thing , which we do n't so it 's nice to actually find a potato side dish with no cheese in it \) br br anyways these are surprisingly good and they toast up nicely in the oven in like 10 minutes worth it for 10 . 
not happy with the product once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and did n't look any thing like the product picture that was seen the shipping cost as much as the potatoes did ! . 
these potatoes are good but i do n't know if i 'd get them again the garlic taste to me was off and strong and i love garlic hoping i just got an off batch . 
omaha steaks 8 \( 5 75 oz \) stuffed baked potatoes br ''' br the stuffed baked potatoes were unimpressive and br lacking in flavor br br i tasted no bacon or chives br br however , they do make an attractive addition to a br meal . 
potatoes were good two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly 10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality like i said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for x mas dinner today or i would n't have had enough 24 oz of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol \( not omaha 's fault \) . 
a 5000 00 diamond would be cheaper to ship than a 5000 00 car ! i do n't buy from any supplier that ships by price br this item is 7 95 then you pay 11 95 for up to 20 00 for shipping \? no way i would pay that for one jar . 
where 's the ingredient list for this product \? thought all foods were supposed to have it would never buy any food without first knowing what 's in it ! . 
loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form this tea is black tea with prickly pear flavor the shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea if there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when i drink it it just tastes like regular black tea very disappointing . 
so disappointed with this frosting the first time i used this frosting i was disappointed , but a year has gone by and i thought that maybe i had gotten a bad container i really should have thought twice about buying it again , but i wanted to give pillsbury the benefit of the doubt boy was i wrong in doing that both times that i used it , the frosting pretty much 'sagged' off of the cake ! my cakes were definitely cooled i had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers after thawing it in the fridge , i began to ice it sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake \( again \) ! this product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting , the recipe needs tweaked , or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together shame on me for trying it a second time ! . 
i bought this because of the good feedback and bad luck that i have had with canned crab i was hoping that this product was different than previous canned crab that i have had alas , it is just a little better unfortunately , canned crab just seems to be not very good and i have to stick with fresh expensive crab . 
this was very pricey for what is essentially a small bag of hard crumbs br maybe my dog is just spoiled , but she treats these like third class treats it is definitely on the bottom of the doggie treat hierarchy more often than not , she will simply walk away from these glad other people like them , but i will not be buying them again . 
i remember well the beer nuts i used to savor those were the days of the big 'redskin' type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang i remember so well these nuts i now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of beer nuts in any way yes , there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real plus , these nuts are simply the common inexpensive 'spanish peanuts' in short , i would just ask beer nuts 'what happened \? ' . 
i ate beer nuts all through my childhood years and into my 20's after that you couldn't buy them in upstate ny when a great friend of mine said he was looking for them , i checked out the net to find them on your site br they are horrible what a dissapointment they taste more like spanish peanuts with out the salt the beer nuts i remember where sweet and salty , just like the label says these peanuts are bland , bland , bland . 
the flavor of the old beer nuts is almost entirely gone the beer nuts are now just plain spanish peanuts with a slight flavor , hardly noticeable extremely disappointing . 
it is not the best way to buy beer nuts br br perhaps the product had been exposed to high heat and a whole lot of shaking most of the coating and flavoring was off of the nuts even though the individual cans are sealed , it is like the nuts had been sitting out in a bowl for a long time on a hot , humid day . 
the current product , certified organic raw cacao powder from ecuador , sold by saaqin , is of terrible quality somehow , reviews for a similar item , produced by alive and aware , were associated with this product the cocoa i received when ordering through this page is made by organic herbal essence alive and aware is delicious organic herbal essence is not another warning after receiving the 5lb bag of organic herbal essence and hating it , i ordered alive and aware certified organic raw cacao powder from ecuador 2 pounds , shipped by halaleveryday i thought for sure i 'd get alive and aware , given it 's in the product title , but halaleveryday actually shipped me organic herbal essence grr . 
as another reviewer stated , many of the reviews for this product are actually for a different raw cacao powder from alive and aware , ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder that is what i ordered about 3 months ago and it was awesome ! i am almost out and when i went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product , from saquin \? \? , which is not what i ordered , and it is more expensive the same base price but i got it with free shipping , not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase i know it was still from alive and aware mid february , but recently something changed br i am really confused irritated how my review for alive and aware raw cacao got switched to a different brand from a different seller \? ! \? ! i mean , ca n't they just say out of stock or currently unavailable like they do with other stuff why would they switch reviews around \? br seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one , especially since as the other reviewer stated they are not comparable and this stuff from saquin is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware also the price increase is pretty shocking ! i guess it is the market , and raw cacao is in higher demand too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao br i did recently order alive and aware 's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those they are as the description states , from alive and aware , not another brand br frankly i am beginning to wonder about some of the brands and vendors that ship from amazon i know they have warehouses in different parts of the country , but it is a little suspicious and i just wish there was more transparency about what comes from amazon and what comes from a different company seems like halal everyday , alive and aware , etc , are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday saquin are these really different companies , under the auspices of amazon , or is it amazon by a different name only \? like the other reviewer said , he ordered something that said alive and aware in the description and when it came it was from saquin halal everyday who knows i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon br br for now , i am going to seek out another source , not through amazon , that stands behind their cacao it is very important to me , for health benefits and the ecological social impacts of where it is harvested , to know that i am getting top notch , certified organic , raw cacao if amazon is going to be so wishy washy and sneaky , i'm going elsewhere \( wagging finger at amazon ! \) br br i think for now i will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back br br heavens to besty , this stuff rocks ! ! it is such a good value too , maybe the best out there as i have def shopped around i have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder , and this is certainly top notch kudos to alive and aware for offering it at such a reasonable price ! ! br i am not a raw foodie per say , but i try to follow a neo paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao properly prepared , with just enough natural sweetener , i think this is a truly guilt free pleasure it is loaded with antioxidants , as you probably know so go ahead , get the big bag you can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food of the gods \( theobroma \) as they say \) br my favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa i just whisk it into gently heated fresh \( raw \) whole milk or cream \( so it 's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible , i know it 's not 100 raw but hey this is how i love it ! \) , add just enough sweetener \( i like sorghum molasses , a scant t spoon \) , a bit of maca powder , a dash of real salt , and after that 's thoroughly whisked i top it off with a spoonful of evo coconut oil yumm ! ! ! i have converted everyone , even the kids i babysit \( who used to prefer swiss miss \) or i make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk , lightly sweetened you better believe it goes fast ! ! i love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins a , d and the x factor \( read weston a price \) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry i am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy ! ! br also process it with evo coconut oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil i often toss in soaked , dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars just process in batches so it 's kind of homogenous like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw br go for it ! buy this huge bag , share the goodness and you 'll be healthier and happier for it i guarantee ! ! peace be with you ! . 
this product , described as organic raw cacao powder from peru , is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder i have had the taste of this product is definitely not as good this product has a bitter , muddy , thin taste as compared to the fuller , richer taste of the real thing from other vendors as soon as i tasted this product , which is destined for the trash bag , i understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors it is nowhere near as good spend a few dollars more and get the real thing . 
ya know , when you 're on a gluten free diet , you yearn for those forbidden treats like licorice ! \( and malted milk ! \) realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future , we need to alter our expectations for this treat br br i had tried this company 's raspberry laces and strawberry laces pretty good , although not easy to chew \( think bubblegum \) not real licorice you understand , but pretty doggone good as an alternative br br so i thought i try these too how bad could they be \? i found them pleasant to chew not tough at all but the taste \? nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful br br so i'm stuck with 11 packs br br see if you ca n't find a source where you can buy just one pack to try out your tastes may be different than mine , and you might enjoy them . 
maybe these a better when they 're very fresh you could ruin dental work if not careful chewing these they taste great . 
i bought this for my husband since he loves ranch he uses ranch dressing with everything before i bought it , i read a review that said it taste good inspite of the fat free well , my husband had it and says it 's aweful i guess to each his own everyone 's tastebuds are not alike someone else may like it , so i am not going to discourage anyone from trying it however , i had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes ranch in the family , does n't like this one i guess he needs the fat \) . 
i sent this product to my brother in law , so i have never seen the product and know nothing about it all i heard from him was that he was not impressed other than that , i can say that it was delivered i ordered two of these going to different addresses and we got immediate feedback on the first one , but until we spoke to my brother in law , we had no idea if the product had even been shipped would i order again \? probably not br br thanks anyway , br curt u . 
i have mixed feelings about nunaturals nustevia white stevia with maltodextrin powder and will probably not purchase it again do n't get me wrong , it 's a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use , but it is just 6 4 percent stevia and 93 6 percent maltodextrin filler in other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder in my opinion , this is unnecessarily dilute however , it does make it exceptionally easy to measure if the labeling said 6 4 stevia extract , i would have passed on this from the beginning as i can get 70 dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia if this is your first time buying stevia , go for it as it 's easy to use and tastes great if you 're accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts , you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this product 's mixture br br pros br 5 star taste br easy to measure br perfect for first time stevia users br 3 4 tsp 1 tbsp cane sugar br br cons br only 6 4 stevia br not cost competitive with 70 or pure dry stevia extracts br 3 4 tsp 1 tbsp cane sugar br br overall , a good product but not the best value i would given it 4 stars if the product labeling did n't try to hide the fact that it 's just not very potent for about 1 3 to 1 2 the cost of this product , you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead \( or just use them full strength , which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia \) br br in case you 're wondering where i got the 6 4 \( by mass \) value from , this is how i calculated it on a precise scale , i found the density of this product to be 2 5 grams per teaspoon the label says it contains 40mg per 1 4 tsp thus , 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder the concentration \( mass \) comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6 4 percent by weight pretty weak stuff , but still much sweeter than cane sugar . 
this was my favorite stevia product and i had it on subscribe and save until i queried customer service about nunaturals gmo use yes , nunaturals uses gmo products so , i 've canceled my subscribe and save order and am now using a href http www amazon com gp product b001ell3u0 stevita stevia clear liquid extract , 3 3 ounce container \( pack of 3 \) a . 
maybe my tastebuds are different but i bought this at a local healthfood store and i'm not completely sold on it i tried it in my tea and it did leave me w an aftertaste just like most sweetners shrugs . 
i bought this 4 pack to have some inexpensive caviar to use for garnish over the holidays the other night i decided to go ahead and use one for some dip it was so bad i could n't believe it it was n't spoiled , it just had an odd flavor with a terrible aftertaste it did n't even taste like caviar i threw the jar away . 
this stuff is n't bad at all but you know how you can just eat spoon after spoon of really good caviar without toast points or crackers or anything \? this roe is more for sprinkling over fish dishes , morning eggs or a caesar salad all in all , for the price , it 's pretty good , . 
i use red lumpfish caviar in a couple of dishes , and this brand is as good as any i 've found , though the red coloring is perhaps a little much ! . 
i ordered this for gifts around christmas time i actually was hoping to use it for our christmas day meal two out of the four jars i ordered were rotten and inedible i never did get to try it and i was very annoyed and disappointed ! . 
this stuff sounded perfect way too much red dye and no taste according to me and my 3 friends who tried it kind of salty basically , i would stay away from it i am tempted to toss it out , but paid too much to feel right about it . 
caviar taste awful maybe it 's because i bought from a cheaper brand or maybe because cavier is just bad no matter who you buy it from or how much you paid for it \? why do people like to waste money on these things \? . 
thought these were the larger sized ones you see in stores but i was mistaken these pops are about 7 inches long and a little less than 1 inch wide flavors are comparable to flavor ice , not necessarily better my wife and i enjoy these throughout the year instead of ice cream , but we can only find them in our local grocery store during the summer months glad we can get them via amazon ! these were on sale for 5 48 per box of 100 with free shipping , so i think we got a good value without the sale pricing , i'm not sure if we 'd choose these over another brand , but if they do go on sale again , we would probably buy them again not bad , just a little small eat two ! \) . 
i would never have ordered this had i known i was only going to be sent 12 , and one of them was open and leaking powdered spice out i complained to amazon , and i know from experience that they always have awesome customer service since i just got my package today and just opened it now , i have to wait a bit to hear back from them on this issue will keep you updated i just wanted you guys to know that even though it states 144 packets , it is not must be a misprint \? double check with amazon before you order this what sounds like an awesome deal is a meh deal if you are getting only 12 of them . 
i found this product doing a search for edible gold leaf i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it however it is clearly marked not to be consumed and for decorative use only so this is a misleading product . 
are you familiar with the hormel compleats line \? if so , put this one in the middle of the pack it 's not as good as the meatloaf or the meatballs noodles in cream sauce it 's better than the horribly taste free chicken dressing about even with the turkey is that all i 've tried \? i forget but you get the point it 's medium compleat br br are you just thinking about trying a hormel compleat for the first time \? ok , then just remember these reviews on amazon particularly food reviews are all simply opinions of customers , no scientific analysis intended \( i hope \) br br compleats are quick , easy \( except for pulling the plastic off the top \) and generally edible there 's not a whole lot more to say about them i eat them because i'm an old guy living alone and too often i'm just lazy these do come in handy for a quick light meal light depending on your appetite and the size of your tummy br br this is a good one to lead off with if you 're just now getting into compleats just note that , in my opinion , it 's middle of the road for the line not a lot of flavor but goes down ok . 
i 've tried several of the compleats line , including this one , and they all have one thing in common the picture on the box looks like a lot of food with a moderate amount of sauce on it , but the box actually contains a moderate amount of food with a lot of sauce on it br br the chicken and rice flavor has some shredded chicken with rice , carrots and peas and a whole lot of chickeny flavored sauce it 's very salty but not lacking in chicken flavor the texture of all of the ingredients is decent , neither too firm nor too mushy , except for the ratio of sauce to solid food being too saucy overall , i 'd say it 's fine in a pinch these shelf stable meals are easier to find than most but if you have other options available , these are only fair to middlin' . 
like the majority of other meals in the hormel line , this one is excessively salty that alone is tolerable though if only the meal was n't swimming in sauce this ends up being more like a soup than a rice meal which is an utter shame because everything else is fairly nice and the enormous amount of sauce ruins it br br but it 's very quick and easy to make and fills you up so even a blah meal like this fits the bill it 's not my favorite of this type of meals but i would n't turn it down for lunch one hungry afternoon . 
me and my wife have tried a wide range of the hormel compleats , and this is by far the worst tasting one of the bunch i could complain about the lack of chicken but the horrid taste even br overshadows that minor drawback i know its a cheap meal , but i do expect something at least a little edible if you are looking to the compleats then go with something at least worth you money , pick up the far superior tasting spaghetti or turkey dinners , and feed this thing to the family dog . 
not bad , but like others say a bit too salty i do notice a strange after taste , tho i like boyardee 's better and wo n't buy this again . 
this is a starchy soup rather than the meal portrayed on the outside there is very little taste and very little chicken it is mostly rice in a weak chicken stock thickened with potato and corn starch br br it is not repulsively bad , if you want a light , convenient snack br br the chef boyardee microwavable meals are tastier and more substantial , and also more convenient because you just have to pull off the lid , which comes away easily with these hormel compleats , you have to pierce the top first , and then peel it off afterwards , which is not so easy , especially as it is hot . 
this is ramen , a cheap , easy , and fast noodle meal that is pretty cheap its got its pros and cons , but mostly its pretty alright the chicken flavor is good some people find it too salty , i like it as is the price here on amazon is comparable to some groceries when its not on sale , higher than others still , if you 're like me and want to avoid the stores as much as possible , maybe paying a 1 more for 24 is n't such a big deal nutritionally its pretty meh you could do a lot better but its also a versatile base you can always add lots of veggies , meat , other spices , pretty much anything to this to dress it up and make it a better meal option we keep it in the house for quick lunches when no one wants to cook a meal just for themselves . 
the taste is n't good , at least is n't good for japanese and chinese br its taste is basically sort of american japanese taste br plus the price is n't competitive br br i 'd suggest asians never buy it . 
i like the concept , and i like asian food , but the roasted peanut noodle variety of this mcdougall 's entree does n't have enough peanut flavor for me sauce is rather thin , too , and the flavor 's fine just not sure i could identify it as peanut i 'll try a different variety next time , i think . 
tastes great price is okay received in timely manner , but two of the soup packages were bent hope the price comes down . 
for a 220 calorie dish that can sit in your desk drawer indefinitely , this really is n't bad it 's certainly better than chef bouyardee or easy mac or actual cup of noodles i 've only ever had one other dr mcdougall 's product which was the tortilla soup and i much preferred it i found this one to be a bit bland it was pretty much just dried cup of noodles type noodles with some peanutty powder and a few green onions i think the peanut flavor could have been more pronounced and i was n't crazy about the texture of the noodles i guess i was hoping for a bit more than ramen with peanut sauce br br i only gave this three stars because i thought it was a bit of a let down i liked it but i did n't love it as much as i should have given my love of peanut sauce i would maybe buy it again at a grocery store if it was on sale but i certainly do n't see myself buying them in bulk from amazon my go to desk drawer food is still annie chun 's udon noodle soup bowl the calorie count is pretty similar \( i think annie chun 's is like 280 or so \) but the texture of the noodles is far superior because they use the vacuum sealed pre cooked noodles however , if you 're not in the mood for soup , these peanut noodles may be a better way to go after all . 
first time i 've tried this item , it 's just ok , the broth is tasty but the noodles are pretty bland to me . 
the noodles for this product are what make me gag i am not a fan of this meal at all and i lt 3 asian food for those looking for a delicious snack who are not already 100 vegan i would either a \) go try 1 first or b \) skip buying this package as it is not delicious . 
i read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy , decent tasting cup of noodles needless to say i found this not to be true first , the consistency is gross and second , the taste is awful maybe i am just not accustomed to eating crap think twice before ordering this product i wish i did . 
this coffee supposedly is premium , it tastes watery very thin not good at all maybe old \? \? br not sure , it was a waste , and i'm using it line the bottom of my sitting shoes and trash cans and rained on luggage , to absorb the smells so i used it , but not to drink do not buy . 
my sister and i did a blind taste test with these to see if the price was worth it , and we could n't tell the difference between these and the two other brands i had on hand i would n't buy them again . 
i never got the product and complained about the non receipt so i bought some in the store klefje lskejfewl lsfjewldf . 
makes nasty loose poo ! the dry food does the same thing i 've tried the adult version and the puppy version and both gave my adult dog and my puppy super soft and stinky stools . 
i have purchased locally many other flavors of da vinci syrups , and ordered blueberry online to try it , because it isnt available locally and i love blueberry ! well , this was a disappointment to me very very sugary sweet with little blueberry flavor not to mention i paid 4x what i would pay locally br very disappointed . 
i am a big fan of most of the freeze dried fruit and veggies , they are crunchy and flavorful and have nothing added the tomato fragments are extremely dry and tough , more like old sun dried , and for me they are only good when used in cooked dishes i do appreciate that these are organic ! . 
it is a good tasting product it does not raise my blood sugar as much as regular pasta but you still ca n't eat a whole box and expect your glucose levels will be normal . 
this coffee is absolutely horrendous i cannot believe it has any favorable reviews and agree with the other reviewer who believes positive reviews were written by employees i cannot stress enough how bad this coffee is it does n't even taste like coffee the best way to describe it is a cup of chemicals i am really bummed i cannot returned this a complete waste of money it all went in the garbage . 
the flavor of these pods is horrid i ordered them only because senseo was out of stock for so long , and i needed some decaf pods , and these had received a couple good reviews \( which i now suspect were written by baronet employees \) i have never tasted such awful coffee before a big yuk for baronet . 
how come you sent me instant choc fudge pudding br the order told you to send me the cook serve choc fudge pudding br you show the picture of it br why could n't send it to me br it makes me wonder if i should order anything else from you br pissed . 
i tried the martha white turtle fudge chocolate chip cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies i have ever made either there is someone on the staff of martha white who has a lopsided sense of humor or their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation i wasted my time , a lot of money on chocolate and pecans , and my effort martha white either needs to tweek this recipe or take it off the website so no other unsuspecting housewife will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies my husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage . 
not bad for a prepackaged and quickie meal if you 're looking for authentic thai , this will give you only half the flavor , so the name that it is only a taste of thai is quite accurate cartons are fancy , but big for the amount they hold it is definitely enough for a meal , but if you 're looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat , you had better grab two it is tasty enough for a meal , but if you can get yourself to an authentic asian supermarket , i guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price \( ie 6 boxes of noodles for 6 \) and i'm not talking about cup o' noodles or things you find at american supermarkets but overall , my husband and i , being the noodle mongers that we are , did enjoy these as something new for the palate however , we will probably opt to order thai takeout for fresh noodles next time we have a craving . 
it 's like eating a large box of paste i enjoy the flavor but i usually cook them and then mix with something else i'm eating as it 's a no go straight out of the box ! . 
i simply do n't like it it is easy to prepare , but when i eat it , i feel that i am eatting a lot of artificial ingredients i cannot even finish one fourth of it . 
overall , this was good , but not great the ginger sauce seemed like it need an extra something to get it a fourth star i think i was expecting a little more ginger taste i 'd buy it again , especially if i can find a good way to punch it up just a little more i may try that egg tip ! . 
we enjoy a taste of tai 's peanut noodles they rock that peanutty flavor mmm so we decided to try these um , ginger , not so much nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor , and the ginger is a bit overpowering br br take this review in stride though , if you 're a ginger lover \( and i'm not talking gilligan 's island here \) , then these may be right up your alley just a bit outside for me , though \( if i may mix my metaphors \) . 
i bought these at walmart for less then 2 00 dollars a box there over 2 80 a box amazon for \( box of six \) then you need to add another 7 00 dollars to your order to get free shipping i would not buy these again could be better if you added chicken or an egg like other reviewers mentioned my box does say gluten free so maybe there are 2 versions . 
a year or so ago , i use to buy these quite often because they were gluten free last month i decided to order some again and this product no longer says gluten free on the packaging and contains wheat i did n't want them to go to waste , so i ate one anyway i became very sick i do enjoy this product but will not be purchasing again because of the wheat just a warning for those of you who also have issues with wheat gluten . 
thanks for the egg tip , it works very well and really helps this product nevertheless , i ended up giving away three of the six containers because i was not thrilled with the nutritional information . 
i had recently tried a similar product from trader joe 's and , not having a tj 's around me presently , i decided to try this more readily available variation i did n't really like this thing too much for starters , there is too much packaging for my liking too many things to throw away and i agree with a previous reviewer that they 're kind of big cartons for how much they hold inside the container are 4 packages one for noodles , and three for various seasonings then you have to add water they give you a fill line , but it 's kind of awkward then microwave for 3 minutes then stir , then microwave again for one minute the one from trader joe 's only has two packets one for noodles , one for sauce and no water involved just microwave for 2 minutes and you 're done and those are a lot tastier i did n't like the texture of this thing \( everything clumped together too much \) and it really did n't have much taste , especially considering the three different packets of seasoning i put in time to try a couple of the other brands of these things . 
i bought these for my son to take to work for lunch apparently his co workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again maybe it was a bad batch . 
i do n't plan on reordering it , but it was definitely edible and filling since i added chicken . 
i tried these as i love thai food , ginger and coconut that was my problem , as this mess does not even vaguely resemble thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste plus , the noodles stick together , even when prepared as suggested , and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them br br also , the nutrition label is misleading i am dieting and read labels very carefully this says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz \( half a cup \) i figured , as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving , that after adding water there would be one serving per package not so , one package is actually two servings , or over 500 calories this is far more than any other pre packaged noodle meal i have seen br br the excessive calorie content might have been ok had the product tasted good , but it does n't i would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess . 
found this product for sale on vacation in north carolina and loved it great maple flavor ! ! walmart sold it for 3 99 for the 24oz pack wish i would have bought some more while i was there because i'm not paying 15 for what walmart can sell for 4 that is just robbery very disappointed in zon for their insanely high price if price was reasonable would love to buy more and rate much higher ! ! . 
i had high hopes when i ordered this tea , as years ago in san francisco i used to buy a lovely rose black in chinatown which was my favorite tea ever unfortunately , this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine i prefer the opposite , a full bodied tea i can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof but for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch , this might be a good choice . 
i was giving my shihtzu the fromm adult gold dog food she did n't seem to want to eat it though so i thought i would try something different i found the harmony farms and thought i 'd give it a try she actually liked it it 's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients i could n't believe how she gobbled this up but after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days her hair also was n't as soft this kibble did not do well for her . 
i read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup br they will not touch it even if i mix it with home cooked food br br they like the dollar store dog food better than this br br amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name . 
these popchips were something i wanted to try because they were baked the barbeque ones were okay but the rest of them were terrible . 
i bought two bags of popchips at whole foods \( original and barbeque \) and loved them when i went to amazon to order lots more , i liked the idea of single serving bags rather than the larger ones , which i 'd consume too quickly i knew i was taking a risk but when the order came , i really disliked about half of the flavors in the assortment in addition , only the original and barbeque nutritional values calculated at 2 pts the others were all 3 i still like popchips but will only buy bags of the flavors i know i will enjoy eating and not have to choke down i recommend that you try a bag of each flavor before you spring for a volume order . 
i agree with many of these reviews the product tastes good not fantastic but good i do n't like real , greasy potato chips and prefer baked lays however if you do enjoy real , greasy potato chips , please see the review referencing pringles and steven baldwin very funny br do buy these if you like an ocassional salty snack but do n't want to devour a large bag of fat filled chips do n't buy these if you are looking for a healthy alternative to chips eat a banana or apple instead \( and not those apple chips or banana chips because they are high in sugar \) br if you do get the big box just put it some place inconvenient like the basement where you will have to exert some energy in order to get them and if you do , bonus ! you just exerted energy and maybe earned a chip or two . 
yum ! i had tried the original and the bar b q and really liked them so decided to get the variety pack for whatever reason the 24 pack is cheaper then the 12 the flavored ones do contain a yeast extract which is similar to msg and gave my grandmother a bad headache so if you know anyone that has a sensitivity to msg , do not give them these these are tasty and a nice substitute for a greasy potato chip but they are not filling you are better off eating a granola bar . 
i bought these and tried each flavor i could not even finish any bag but the barbecue i really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross and the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me how is this the 1 best selling item \? amazed anywho to each his own ! godbless and enjoy but if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind ! . 
definitely better than pirate booty and slightly better than baked chips very tasty but you feel as if you 're almost eat something with the same texture as cereal it 's a small payoff to enjoy chips \( albeit faux chips \) the vinegar and s p ones are nasty ! . 
very tasty chips \( original and other flavors \) , but ones with salt flavor way too salty not sure who likes so much salt in chips . 
i hate to type this , because there are so many people that really enjoy this product , but take a look at the ingredients in this so called all natural product i have the cheddar cheese flavor right in front of me , so that is the only flavor i can vouch for right now about halfway down the list of ingredients you 'll see yeast extract unfortunately , this is the new msg many people are still unaware of this fact and natural food companies are taking advantage it is a chemical flavor enhancer whose potential side effects are very scary google msg yeast extract for yourself , or check out . 
these are to potato chips as pringles are to chips as instant coffee is to brewed coffee and stephen baldwin is to alec baldwin same family but scant resemblance so i 'd buy a single , small package at your grocers and try them out not for everyone , and certainly not for my family which includes two teenage boys even they take a pass on these unless they are truly desperate crispness is ok even mouth feel is good , but there is a lingering \( not good \) taste again , kind of like pringles ps the flavors are ok but definitely taste like they were made at that flavor factory along the jersey turnpike . 
purchased the 0 8oz bag \( seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased \) , but did n't realize it was 0 8 ounces as compared to other bags just be aware might be perfect for some , but not for us having a bag with 10 potato chips in it does n't cut it for me might be perfect for kids but just a heads up . 
i order these chips on a regular basis if you are doing weight watchers , these chips are 2 points a bag when this particular shipment arrived at my house , it was poorly packaged i received a case of crumbs instead of a case of chips this is the 1st time in the four times that i 've ordered these , hopefully it wo n't happen again . 
i do n't know why everyone loves these chips they are healthy but taste disgusting only the original flavor tasted good , so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea i would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these pirate 's booty makes popped chips that are way better . 
i am interested in these but was wondering if someone that has them could post some nutrition info on them \? mainly , fat , fiber , sugars , and then any vitamins \? thanks so much ! ! . 
i decided to try these based on the reviews they are pretty good especially for a more healthy option , but not sure i 'll get them again . 
despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks , i see no reason to buy them again read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non profit consumer organization for reviews they contain a lot of wow ! with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer weigh the others as you will , but the proof is still in the pudding br br the texture is their best asset \( if you like that sort of texture \) that 's about it for me they appear to be an extruded potato product \( many of those out there \) with various seasonings that do not impress me , either the most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the tiny 8oz package if you were a deer , you might eat them for that alone the fat is reduced , that much is true but br br unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium , it 's no deal but wait baked kettle chips , in a 1oz serving , up the fat to 3g , the same as the 8 of the basic flavor you got 2oz free on that one the baked kettles possess 135mg sodium , vs 160 these chips give you 1g fiber in 8 vs 2 in 1oz of baked kettles this product loses again br br the only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips , 15 for these , but remember you have 2oz extra in the kettle 's nutrition info just about a wash br br and then , topping it all the cost 0 92 an oz vs 0 44 for baked kettles in subscription wow these wonderful snacks cost 14 72 per pound , packed as they are the prices will fluctuate but think about the things you can buy for that money instead these are microscopic bags \( that does not help the environment , either portion control aside \) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices br br the most positive thing i can say is the product is packed very well lots of air in the bags to protect the chips , and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags you wo n't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags , so that is a good thing br br but bottom line expensive junk health food wow ! . 
two words potato flakes not sure what the buzz about these is try one bag before you buy a case ca n't be returned . 
ok but would never buy them again my husband ate some br br i thought they tasted a lot like the chips they used to call muncho's ! br br just not for me ! . 
i 've heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips i could n't eat them though , they just do n't taste good to me personally my grandmother loved them though and i gave the rest to her . 
i decided to give these a try since one of my good friends and her son raved about how good they were bad idea ! i almost ordered two since they were such a good price , i am so glad i did n't ! we do n't care of these at all ! the concept is nice , chips that are crunchy and better for you than most , but they taste funny ! they have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable we have been slowly \( and i mean very slowly \) making our way through the 24 the box brought \( we still have 19 left and we received them over two weeks ago \) so they are not so horrible that you ca n't eat them , its just like forcing us to eat them so we do n't have to throw them all away ! if you have n't had them before , i suggest trying them before committing to 24 bags of various yucky flavors ! . 
not anything to rave about they were okay i think if i truly had a craving for chips i would just buy and eat regular ones wo n't buy again . 
although they are mildly healthier , they do n't taste as good as baked lays br br also , having a huge box of chips around is n't necessarily healthy because i ended up eating them more often br br they are worth a try , but they just seem a bit overpriced \( even with subscription savings \) and over hyped . 
they 're okay , but not the most amazing thing ever br br the good br good flavor , no too strong or weak br crunchy , but not too dry br plenty of chips in each bag not just filled with air br not greasy , so makes a good on the go snack br all natural , using no artificial flavors or colors br br the bad br sill plenty of fat per bag \( 3 5 grams per bag of the sour cream flavor \) so do n't get them expecting them to be low fat br tastes like a low fat chip , but with all the fat of regular chips br br conclusion br i'm 50 50 on if i 'll order them again i have a finicky stomach , and so i'm fine with things that taste low fat and healthy , since those are mostly what i eat but these have all the fat and calories of chips that are fried and even more than those that are baked , so i'm undecided on if i want more chips that have a healthy taste with all the fat the all natural ingredients are what make this chip different , and what might bring me back for more it 's definitely one of those snacks you have to try for yourself , and see if you like them or not . 
i love shrimp chips and i love healthier alternatives as well so i thought these would be a match made in heaven not so much the flavors were too strong most of the time \( i am a huge fan of pepper but even i had a hard time enjoying the salt pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is and this is from someone who currently lives in the uk and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here \) and too bleh in others the only flavors that my husband and i both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we did n't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again br br i wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say , i will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on . 
i expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips in reality i get an okay taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors chedder and salt pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips i 've ever had if you 're just looking for a great tasting brand of chips with health as a 2 on the list there are much much better brands out there in the end i compare these chips to diet soda vs regular some wo n't tell the difference while some will immediately sense it and hate it . 
popchips are good and great for diet snack but on amazon the price is nearly double the cost of costco an 18 pack is only 7 89 at costco . 
so for a healthier snack it sure is salty but then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories each bag is 100 calories with 10 sodium intake for the day br br the chips are not bad , i just would n't get them again because most of the flavoring comes from the salt . 
i really wanted to like these all the reviews made it seem supernal , and , well as advertised , it 's not fried nor baked br br however , even though it is advertised as being healthy but still with plenty of flavor , that flavor just means each chip is loaded with salt i only looked at the nutrition facts after i felt they were too salty , and i discover that a 100cal bag contains 10 dv of sodium br br i'm not a health nut , nor am i trying to diet these were my first food purchase from amazon , and i bought them because they were at the top of the search list and seemed to be a best seller however , i just could n't get into these chips br br i realize that the flavour of the chips is up to each individuals' tastebuds , and so i will say that these are perfect for those who enjoy chips with strong flavor i personally enjoy chips where i can taste some potato as well . 
i love amazon and i love the reviews from people , i 've been introduced to alot of great products b c of the reviews , but this time \? total , complete let down ! popchips having 4 5 stars is just down right perplexing ! \? ! the should not get more than a 3 , but generally 1 2 i sorta want to give it a 1 , but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so i through in the extra point br br i ordered these thinking that 'd they 'd be maybe a slightly better version of baked lays man was i wrong i 've tried most of the baked lays flavors , my go to 's at first were 1 \) original baked lays and 2 \) sour cream baked lays \( since those are my favorite regular lays \) but then i discovered bbq baked lays and seriously , those are fantastically great bbq baked lays are packed with so much flavor br br these popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips literally they do because they are n't as good as baked lays i can definitely see eating much less of them \( which could be a benefit \) , but i say just use portion control and zip lock bag a bunch of baked lays br br i'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail , but there 's really not much more i can say br br summary br br how do popchips taste \? like slightly burnt air chips \( it 's sort of a weird taste , takes alot of getting used to \) br br would i suggest buying them \? no if you 're eager to try them , i say buy a bag from your local grocery store a week or so after i ordered these on here i saw them at m local krogers , so they 're definitely expanding br br nutrition information 1 bag \( 8 oz 23g \) 100 calories , total fat 3g \( 5 \) , sodium 210 mg \( 9 \) , total carbohydrate 16g \( 5 \) , dietary fiber 1 g \( 4 \) , sugar 2g , protein 1 g , vitamin a , vitamin c , calcium , and iron 2 br br if you buy a big bag of bbq popchips and big bag of bbq baked lays , here are the nutrition information side by side br br pop chips br serving size 1oz 28g about 19 chips , calories 120 , total fat 4 5g \( 6 \) , sodium 280mg \( 11 \) , total carbohydrate 20g \( 6 \) , br dietary fiber 1g \( 4 \) , sugars 2g , protein 1g br br baked lays br serving size 1oz 28g about 19 chips , calories 120 , total fat 3g \( 5 \) , sodium 210mg \( 9 \) , potassium 230mg , total carbohydrate 22g \( 7 \) , dietary fiber 2g 8 , sugars 3g , protein 2g , vitamin c 4 , calcium 2 br br so these two are very close , but baked lays wins because it virtually has not sodium , since potassium 230mg offsets the sodium 210mg , leaving 20g of potassium plus there 's more fiber and more vitamin c and most importantly they taste better br br i for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that baked lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit br br at the end of the day make a decision for yourself , but i 'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both baked lays and popchips i can almost guarantee you that baked lays will win hands down br br \( hopefully amazon starts selling well priced variety single serve bags of baked lays soon for now i found one from a seller , but the price seems a little high \( but there are 40 bags instead of 20 \) a href http www amazon com gp product b003tvdhio smart mix variety pack , 30 count 7 baked lay 's classic , 6 baked cheetos , 6 baked ruffles , 6 baked doritos nachos cheese 5 rold gold tiny twists \( pack of 2 \) a \) . 
i have not ordered yet , my question is , from the description , it is 24 bags at 0 8 ounces how does this equal 192 ounces in total weight \? . 
i first tried the bbq flavor at a restaurant , which was good then , i was carried away with the 1 2 fat part , which made me pay without realizing my mistake ! br br the salt pepper is ok ! only ok , after trying another one , i changed my mind ! br br the bbq is good , but not that good ! br br the rest is pure trash ! i did not like them , what so ever nor my other 4 friends ! br br the price is wayyyyyy high , and not worth it for a small single serving , as others such as utz is wayyyy better and cheaper ! br br 3 starts is too much for this over marketed , less of flavor , and over priced snack ! br br avoid ! br br 2 stars off bad flavors br br 1 star off pricy as sh ! , and not worth it ! . 
the flavors are kind of funky salt and pepper \? tastes like someone just pored a jar of black pepper over the chips and the salt and vinegar , thee two varieties just make one go yummm ewwwwww tossed out those verities but the others were very good less chip and more like a cracker with a chip flavor still a good item but i would n't suggest the variety pack unless you living dangerous and have lots of water to gag them down with . 
i bought those chips after reading good reviews but i was very disappointed with the taste it was nothing like what i expected \( granted that i expected good old kettle cooked potato chips \) i bought the 6 flavor variety pack and there were many flavors i did not care for it was worth trying them but i am not going to purchase them again in the future . 
pop chips are basically a horribly over priced version of munchos which are baked potato chips and have been around forever period . 
i bought these chips thinking that they are all natural per their description of no preservatives , no artificial flavors or colors when i received them i checked the ingredients , and they contain yeast extract , which is synonymous with msg \( yeast extract contains processed free glutamic acid \) i will never purchase this product again . 
the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor all the other flavor was just so so . 
i was at a charity fund raising event where they were handing these out they seemed pretty tasty , so i bought a couple bags at target the ones i bought \( barbeque and salt and vinegar \) were awful ! i ended up throwing away most of them , neither i nor anyone else who tried them could choke them down the ones they were handing out as samples were clearly very different from what they are selling do n't waste your money . 
these chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco , for 2 , you can get a big bag with 10 times the amount of chips compare to these 0 8oz bag chips , so for 5 in safeway , you can get 30 worth of popchips , these bags are so tiny , it 's like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something , for me , i never gain weigh , i rather go buy big bag of chips , these are expensive ripoff chips , will never buy again br maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazon com , maybe elsewhere is cheaper , but chips as junk food , should n't be that expensive compare to local stores . 
i'm not as crazed about these as everyone else , but for a low calorie snack , they 're fine they certainly do n't do much to curb the appetite though i'm typically just as hungry after finishing as before not like with protein chips \( also available through amazon \) . 
the texture is like rice crackers , which i personally do n't like taste is n't too bad , but every single bags are too salty , even the original flavor i 'd give four stars if they make low sodium chips the salt is one of your worst enemies i bet it does more harms to your body than msg 's . 
these chips are too salty ! ! ! br i like the crunch , size of the bags , and variety br but i cannot finish the case due to how salty these chips are . 
this seemed like the perfect way to limit my addiction to potato chips small , single serving bags i really like the plain , unflavored popchips , but the rest of the flavors had an aftertaste i plan to set up subscribe save for just the plain . 
bought these based on the glowing reviews \( 4 1 2 stars \) , and the fact that they were heavily discounted from the regular price first of all 8 oz per bag equals about 15 or 16 chips per bag , which is not many while this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories , fat or sodium , the fact is that 8 of an ounce is not much , and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time due to the discounted price each bag was around 55 each , not to bad until you figure that equals 10 per pound at the regular price its about 16 per pound as far as the taste , all of the flavors were good , none that i absolutely disliked , but none that really rocked my socks either bottom line , at the discounted price i paid i was not disappointed , but if i had paid the regular price for these i would have felt cheated . 
i actually purchased these i myself find that they taste just like those like rice crisp with salt and flavoring from the reviews i thought they was more like munchos they are not bbq to salty but if you like a little twang its ok according to the family plain is horrible salt and vinegar was the best overall my family gave it 3 stars i will stick to kettle chips . 
i like to take my lunch to work and this is perfect to give me just enough chips that i can munch on with my lunch i love the flavors and the packaging is perfect worth the buy ! the price is right , the flavors are just what they want , portion size is good thus it 's a win , win situation for me and them . 
i really like the pop chips , but i do not like all the flavors the only ones i like are the originals the rest of these flavors were really not good at least not in my family i gave them away to a senior center and most of the seniors didnt like them sorry but it is a matter of taste and most things should stick to the originals , they are the best br br this snack \( originals \) fits into my daily ww program for allot less money then snacks made for the programs specifically br br i will continue to buy the originals and leave the others to others . 
good texture they are crunchy and not sharp \( will not cut mouth \) br br flavor they do not taste like potato chips if i had not just opened the bag i would suspect they were stale but no this is how they taste many others have remarked about the odd flavor as well br br healthy good for dieting i suppose , low oil , and low salt br br i will not be buying these again . 
these chips arrived in terrible condition the box they were sent in was a display box with all the usual perforations on the box for display why someone would send a box like that in the mail and not have put it in another real box is beyond me the box we received was heavily taped to keep it together since the box came open on the display perforations and looked like someone had driven over the box as well , which gives you an idea of the shape of the box the chip bags inside were pretty flat , there were no chips , but plenty of crumbs for any use you would need crumbs for this is how many of the packages looked , flat there were a few with edible chips , but not many not sure what to think of shipping chips in this type of a box , common sense should have been used \? \? . 
next time i will order only the original flavor the other flavors did not suit me too much of an aftertaste . 
the only flavor we could stand was the barbecue \( which was the reason we purchased them in the first place \) ! i had to give the others away ! ! ! i wo n't be buying this again for lunches although the size packaging was great i just wish the other flavors tasted better \( plain , salt , pepper , etc , were n't really kid friendly \) . 
these taste alright , but they are health food by no means at least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices this products is made of processed potato by product and is natural by no means the calorie savings is n't even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil \( if eaten in moderation \) because of the healthy dose of balanced fats in my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits if you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip if you feel these taste better than the above , then by all means enjoy , but do n't be tricked into believing these are healthy at all br overall 4 stars for taste and 2 stars for the marketing scam that they are . 
i purchased these because i was hoping for a healthy alternative to chips well , they 're fairly healthy absolutely no oily residue on the hands and very light and airy however , i just could n't get over the taste , which i can only liken to slightly burnt popcorn if that undercurrent of burnt flavor was n't there , these might have been more palatable , but my taste buds kept zeroing in on that one aspect also , the seasonings were n't consistently strong cheddar was o k bbq was probably the closest match to regular potato chips the flavor was straight from a bag of lays however , i was very disappointed with the sour cream and onion which was just too light in flavor and the vinegar and salt which did n't have as strong a tang as i would have liked br br overall , i would recommend these to someone who wanted to eat healthy and did n't mind a watered down version of a fried chip however , i just could n't stomach them i gave away the unopened bags to coworkers \( none of which were impressed either but they 're not on diets lucky dogs \) for now , i 'll stick with my baked goldfish and bunny crackers . 
these chips taste so dry and gross , i would rather eat carrots or something than these they just did n't satisfy the salty craving and were n't worth the calories . 
i bought this because i had been seeing this pod in magazines and other places i thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro however , this is very poorly designed i could not open it whats or ever , even after searching through reviews after reviews finally , my genius boyfriend found the solution ! basically , you will need to open it from the bottom you will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it you will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there 's water in the pot if any one who is reading this still having problem opening it let me know i 'll try to explain it better there but anyway , this is a pretty useless product for its productivity , but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own , and wants a prettier fridge you can make you own with a cup \( or any container \) filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb \( so unless you have money to waste , do n't buy this useless pot \) . 
i bought this as a gift for my mother she likes it but says it is hard to open when she unwrapped it i remember having to help her figure out how to open it it took me a minute if you have arthritis you wo n't be able to pry this open ! . 
i have had the herb pods for about 6 months they are a great concept , but have a poor design the plastic cover is very hard to take off and snap back on i'm constantly afraid that i'm going to break it the pods do keep herbs fresh for several weeks in the fridge as long as you replace the water unfortunately i do n't use them half of the time i buys herbs because they are more trouble than they are worth . 
with no clear instructions on how to open and close the unit , the first few times are an act of frustration when i finally realized that if i grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield , about one third from it 's bottom and squeeze the sides , the bottom lip pops out nicely br i will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley , basil ect the company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly br all in all i like it , i took away one star for the lack of instructions br br 3 2012 after a few months i have thrown this thing away it became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs i use most i have seen some newer , larger units that do n't have the issue with opening it like this one has i'm going to order one of these br br i no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to 2 stars . 
despite reading the reviews of others on how hard this was to open , i was confident i knew the secret so would be fine not so no matter what i did , could n't pop off the clear plastic lid instructions showed the bottom part screwing off , did n't husband could n't even do it and he opens everything for me he finally got it open , only held about half of the aspargus which is what i wanted it for so tossed it in the garbage and then bought one from progresso that we both can open note to self , pay more attention to what people are saying . 
the reviews on this are so true great idea , but such a pain to pop the clear lid off from the side , even once i figured it out i keep waiting for it to break in my hands because it does take some pressure to pop off the lid but it feels fragile and likely to break with too much pressure i would consider buying one of the new designs that seem sturdier and open from the top \( not the side \) . 
i rarely write reviews , but these pods are so awful , i was hoping to save even one person from wasting their money like i did the little green plug barely stays in even after twisting it so the water is always sloshing out and the clear plastic cover is absolutely the worst design it is nearly impossible to remove and actually snapped into shards when i tried to open one of the pods \( and i can attest that those plastic shards are sharp ! \) if you are able to actually open the pod , be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs \( which they do n't really do \) , they would not be worth the aggravation or cost like another reviewer said , just put your herbs in a cup with a little water in the bottom and a plastic bag covering the top works perfectly and costs nothing please do n't waste your money on this ! . 
i 've had a couple of these for a few years but find that i do n't use them all that often because their size design limits their usefulness for bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch , and it 's difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it it works great for asparagus , but only for small ish bunches and if the spears are n't too tall br br more often than not i simply use a canning jar 1 2 of water with a plastic bag over the top , which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access these pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bag topped jar , however , and the clear front makes it harder to forget what 's in there br br they are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over and the little drain port is fun to use br br but it only works for small bunches . 
i got one of these for xmas and to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive container br br the main problem is the container is difficult to open it does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go br br the thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it \( you do n't need to open the bottom just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out firmly \) do n't worry you wo n't break it it is pretty sturdy plastic br br the real issue is when it is filled or has water in it its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling br br i 've just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill port then popping it br br prepara please read these reviews and improve on the next design ! ! ! . 
even with the tips shared on how to open it , it 's still pretty difficult to open i guess i have weak hands my husband usually has to open it for me , and even he does n't do it with ease i would recommend getting the larger prepara herb savor instead of the pod it 's much easier to open and can hold more i could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod \( considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and i only use half \) . 
saw this on oprah 's favorite things and thought it would make a great little christmas gift for my friends that love cooking as much as i do since they come in packages of three , i kept one and gave two away i could n't open mine to clean it , so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time i thought it was just too tight from the factory my basil looked great after ten days but when i went to use the basil , i could not open the pod husband not home neighbor not home dog missing thumbs i tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle \( okay , maybe a little harder than 'lightly , ' i was pretty frustrated \) luckily i had emptied the water , so i only had a small mess to clean up the pod went into the garbage forcefully i checked with my friends friend 1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it friend 2 has now been warned there were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments i 've read , we 're not the only ones who have had this problem i think this was designed by the same guy that invented the security wrapping tape on music cds ! i 've gone back to my old method a wide mouth mayo jar with pretty hair band holdingdown a circle of fabric it works ! . 
i wanted very much to like this product , but after using it for more than 9 months , i just ca n't the clear plastic cover is very difficult to get off , especially when the pod is filled with water it 's also difficult to get the cover on , especially when you 're trying to store bushy herbs like parsley or cilantro the o ring that is supposed to seal the bottom of the pod does n't seem to seat correctly after removing the bottom of the pod to clean out dirt left behind from some rooted herbs , i 've never again been able to get it to be water tight consequently , every time i use my pod , i have to store it in a bowl or else i'm mopping up water from my fridge shelf on the plus side , the leaky bottom helps to remind me to change the water every day ! . 
i 've been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb vegetable salad bins inside to grow vegetables and i thought the prepara herb savor pod looked like the perfect precursor wrong the detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere similarly , the plastic plug at the back does not hold a good idea , a nice looking product , but poorly executed refrain from purchasing plastic bags are much , much better . 
i threw this away after about a week of ownership could n't get the clear plastic cover on and off without spilling water all over , and half the time , i could n't get it off at all it only works for long stemmed herbs , and all need to be about the same height . 
the prepara herb savor pod is advertised holding asparagus that was why i purchased it , thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh in reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short the ad is misleading i 'll keep it for storing herbs , but asparagus is out of the question . 
after i enptied the can , i noticed it was black in an area at the top of the can and appeared to be corroded of course i was afraid to eat the fruit , so i threw it away i am waiting for a response from native forest to ascertain the type of metal can and if it is harmful one would expect if they went to the effort to be certified as organic , they would use safe canning i will post an addendum w their response . 
after reading a previous review i carefully inspected the cans when they arrived the cans were immaculate and very clean so i felt relieved after cooling in the fridge i ate the first can the fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth i eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me only days later my teeth and gums were infected and i had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad he found infection and i had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before i was finally ok again after about 2 weeks sheesh ! needless to say i threw out the remaining cans of fruit ! the problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean quality control must really suck i'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided this is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there i would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health ! . 
this product was a complete disappointment tastes like mushy pineapple there was no papaya taste . 
i will never buy this item again ! ! i was addicted to it until the last order ! ! fruits had foul smell , tasted rotten ! ! was the expiration dates forged ! \? . 
i tried tropical pineapple it was delicious i gave a bad review for tropical fruit salad becuase it had watermelon and pineapple in it i think the two of these were competeing for the flavor i see now thats what i think it was , probably not a bad product at all sue . 
this fruit would be fine if it were not for the soft slimey textured watermelon and some other fruit that is in this can that is just slimey and icky there are certain fruit that should n't be canned , and otherwise the crunchy pieces are fine much of the soft fruit i had to discard albeit , this item is good frozen and added to other fruit to make smoothie 's then you do n't have to taste the slime . 
edit i just noticed each bag is only 1 76 pounds , not 2 2 my review is not 2 stars instead of three br br first off , as you can probably guess by the pictures , these are sour gummies that is n't said in the description also , each one is about 2 to 2 1 2 inches in length and 1 2 inch wide br br texture and flavor the came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings the sourness is average , not overwhelming but not too little where i took off the 2 stars was the flavor \( most important part \) as i chewed them , a few different flavors hit my tongue , none of which tasted that great i could n't make out any of them in particular \( not good at that anyways \) but the combination was just plain strange br br i could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews niece after all , they will eat anything sugar coated right \? . 
what are the white flecks floating in my recently ordered bottles of dirty martini olive juice \? . 
i purchased this item because it was cheaper than other olive juices i was looking for a good quality olive juice for martinis i was pretty disappointed the juice is very strong i followed the instructions and put the ratio on the bottle into the shaker and made a martini the ratio was 2 part vodka to 1 part olive juice it was way too salty the olive juice was over powering i made a decent dirty martini with 2 parts vodka 1 4 part olive juice i would not recommend this item . 
ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid read the ingredients the main label says olive juice by no such thing i am going to suggest that amazon take this off the website . 
this product is simply for cheap liquor since taste and quality is not important ! i prefer to drink my grey goose straight however , on occasion it is absolutely delicious with a very tiny splash of olive juice this product was a a quick fix for me to stop purchasing olives in order to use the juice it 's not worth it ! ! the after taste is worse ! ! . 
sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill this is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti caking agent into your food , and no iodide the anti caking agent is n't event that effective , so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit stay away ! . 
this candy tasted like sugar without much rose flavor at all br br i ended up throwing most of it out because i do n't like so much sugar i prefer strong flavors like a href http www amazon com gp product b001kyoene altoids twin pack mints , wintergreen 2 tins a br br the center of the candy does have a licorice flavor because it 's an anise seed but there are better licorice candies out there like a href http www amazon com gp product b0029jtzlk twizzlers twists , black licorice , 1 pound bags \( pack of 6 \) a . 
i have never had sea salt before but the 95 sodium free got to me it has to be an acquired taste because i do n't really like it perhaps if i used it regularly i would not want to go back and , perhaps if the salt came from other seas around the world it might taste different as well . 
the pork chops from omaha steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem . 
i too was a little disappointed with the mix of the donut sampler in my case i had 12 of the 35 were decaf but i guess this is what you get when you purchase a sampler pack through the amazon warehouse deals section all the k cups had a best used by date of 6 2012 i was happy about that atleast . 
i have had the regular donut house coffee before and enjoyed it , but i had never had the flavored kind i was looking for a sampler pack to so my roommate and i could try the flavors as well as get some of the regular stuff i do n't drink decaf , so i knew that some of this pack would not be used i figured that the rest of the cups would make up for the loss on the decaf i was wrong this sampler pack was a joke 18 of the cups were decaf , and 15 of them were the standard house brew i got 1 cup of chocolate glazed donut and 1 cup of cinnamon roll now , i will not be using most of the k cups in this package because it was , again , mostly decaf ! ! ! ! ! this is what they consider a sample pack br br 8 donut house regular br 9 donut house decaf br 7 donut shop regular br 9 donut shop decaf br 1 donut house chocolate glazed donut br 1 donut house cinnamon roll br br some sample . 
my husband just bought a keurig coffe maker in the box was samples , his favorite was donut shop i ordered the 35 k cup for him i was so disappointed , out of the 35 k cups 11 were decaf , giving me 6 k cups of each of the 4 flavors br i also ordered the wolfgang puck sampler , i got 12 flavors 4 each how cool is that ! br i would order donut shop again , just not the sampler . 
i ordered this because i have had the donut shop coffee before and really enjoyed it and wanted to taste some of the other flavors they offered after receiving my order of the sampler pack , i was very disappointed ! over half my order was decaf coffee and i only got 2 cups of the flavored coffee which was the main reason i ordered it i love this coffee but am disappointed in the so called sampler pack or the lack of variety pack ! . 
i got this on the warehouse deal so i was n't expecting much however , be advised you will get no regular donut shop and instead you will receive over half of the box as decaf i love the flavors of all of these though , so that 's ok but i will think hard about getting another variety pack . 
i have been using these treats for quite a while and both my dogs love them but both dogs are also way off their food and have been for quite some time and both have been acting kind of off nothing major but just not exactly right well , i just happened to quit using these treats for a week or so and noticed both dogs came back to life and they 're eating like crazy i cannot for certain pin it on these treats but it 's something to keep in mind if you are using them and your pet seems a little off kilter . 
if you like werther 's hard candies , you may like these the pretty good caramels but they are hard , and really sticky like do i have all my fillings \? sticky br br eating a bag now but i wanted caramels , and these really are n't the are closely related , but so different , in terms of texture br br not my cup of tea if you like your caramels really hard \( not hard candy hard , but still \) , you may love these if you think caramels should be soft and chewy , you may not br br now , i just tried warming them up , and that really helped almost tempted to raise it up to 4 stars do n't microwave it though that turns them into a bubbling mass of goo ! . 
i used to buy bob 's red mill organic 7 grain pancake waffle , whole grain mix until i saw all these rave reviews about stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix i decided to order from amazon and tried it this morning br br this pancake mix is very fine and powdery when i made my pancake mix , the mix was all over my kitchen floor the mix is almost foamy like when it is done mixing the waffle recipe from the label asks for 2 tbsp of melted butter , which i never use that much when i use the rob 's red mill pancake mix i could only make two perfect 7 round pancakes from it even though it claims the serving should be 3 4 pancakes the pancake is indeed fluffy as others claimed in the review however , i also tasted a lot of chemicals in it i guess one reason it is so fluffy is a lot of baking soda in the ingredient looking at the ingredient label did i realize it has more chemicals than other brands and i do not understand what artificial flavor it has to be added in when this pancake mix is just the normal type with no fancy flavors like cinnamon and apple , etc br br in short , i am going back to my rob 's red mill brand , at least i know what i am digesting in my stomach . 
didnt really enjoy these after wanting to try something other than aunt jemima 's from dominicks the pancakes tasted strange and sometimes forgettable , but it might have been due to the poor packaging they came in along with the syrup . 
stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix is definitely a mouthful in name but , in taste , not so much do n't get me wrong , it 's not bad but , you could find any number of mixes that taste just as well and some even better i know my taste buds are n't the same as yours so , what 's just decent to me may be great to you i also wish i had bought just one can instead of 2 huge 33 ounce cans i finished the first can , i 'll give the other can away and , i 'll continue trying other mixes until i find the best mix out there br br so far i seem to only be satisfied with a homemade mix for my waffles my preference is for waffles over pancakes but , this did n't make it on either count i even tried adding things to it but it did n't really help maybe it 's just me try it if you like but remember , buy only one can just in case you 're like me you can always buy more . 
i love this pancake mix can not find this exact one in any stores so i always order online and keep in stock at home all you do is mix with water \( i add fresh chopped banana 's or strawberries for a healthy option , and swap syrup for honey \) and cook in a lil butter and you have an awesome breakfast . 
i have an immense love for pancakes i have been on a search for the best pancake mix for about a year i did not write this review prematurely as i wanted to give the product a fair chance i tried it with whole milk i tried it with buttermilk i tried it with blueberries i tried it without blueberries it is by far the worst mix i have tried thus far the flavor is not good , seems like it needs more sugar with blueberries , it is very hard to get the pancakes to cook all the way through without overcooking them i really am telling you all the hype on this product has got to be from people that either work for the company lol or have never tried another high quality mix i honestly would rather eat pancakes from mcdonalds do n't waste your money ! \( robbys mix is also wayyyyyyyyyy better and i believe it was cheaper \) \( may be better for waffles since i'm stuck with two cans i may try that ugh ! \) . 
the best thing about this pancake and waffle mix is the can in which it comes i really like the convenience of the can and the fact that it reseals easily br the batter cooked up nicely and the texture was ok however i was very disappointed in the flavor there were stong overtones of chemical flavors br i will be experimenting with my own recipes in the future . 
been curious about stonewall since reading all the amazon reviews but not sure about spending for a pancake mix the other day , found a big can at sur la tab store in san francisco for only 10 95 , so i thought , why not , this is my chance to try i was so looking fwd to saturday morning and made it first thing today all i can say is , underwhelming , nothing special i tried it following the instructions but using low fat milk and healthier butter , it was alright , but not great esp considering the price then i doctored it up a bit , added madagascar vanilla , flaxseed and psyllium which i usually do with my pancakes , tasted a bit better overall rating , 3 stars , just ok , stuck with the can so we 'll eat it , but will not purchase again i will probably try it next time with full fat milk and butter as it recommended to see if that makes a difference , it probably does i highly recommend garvey 's organic pancake mix , also here in amazon , tastes so much better and fluffier if you like 100 whole grain pancakes , we also love kodiak buttermilk mix , also here on amazon healthy , hearty and so good , even my kids love it and best of all it 's just add water , makes it portable , we even took it with us on vacay to hawaii . 
when i read the reviews from other customers , i was excited about ordering and trying this mix this morning we made waffles with both stonewall kitchen mix and bisquick the waffles from stonewall were ok and so were the waffles from bisquick the waffles were served to several people for tasting and everyone felt the same br br the agreement was that stonewall kitchen product was not worth the significant extra cost furthermore , it is not available in our local super market whereas bisquick is stocked this will be a one time purchase for us . 
i am constantly on the search for delicious buttermilk pancakes because they are my favorite food in the world i like to make my own or get them at the original pancake house \( which has the best buttermilk pancakes i have ever tasted \) i decided to try this box mix variation even though i am not a fan of box mixes the stonewall brand has a very aromatic scent but that 's where i ceased to be impressed these pancakes hardly rise at all and have a decent flavor and texture but are nothing to gush over then again i guess i'm one of the few who would gush over a plain bettermilk pancake anyway ! ! they 're ok but not worth all that money . 
every week i make waffles or pancakes for my wife and daughter their opinion is that the waffles taste different from but not better than those i make with jiffy mix as jiffy mix costs a lot less , i will not likely order this product again . 
this expensive pancake mix tastes so processed and fake a less expensive bisquick from your local grocery store beats the taste , no doubt it 's a yucky product . 
this mix makes nice pancakes they smell rich and vanilla y , but you do n't actually taste it as strong as it smells i wo n't buy them again because there are easier mixes out there that taste pretty darn close i'm just as happy using a krusteaz brand mix that only requires the addition of water \( no eggs or milk or flour necessary \) heck , if you want that vanilla smell and taste , add an eighth or quarter teaspoon of some extract to your batter br br edited for grammar 's sake . 
this mix produced some pretty bland pancakes followed the directions on the canister and the batter was pretty thin which in turn produced some pretty thin pancakes considering the ingredients that needed to be added , it would have been just as easy to create my own buttermilk pancakes from scratch i debating trying to figure out how to jazz up the remaining canisters i have left \( maybe some pumpkin pie spice \) but that wo n't help the thicken up the batter . 
makes okay pancakes only marginally better than the standard bisquick recipe they are edible \( i should say that my kids liked them \) br br not that great , in my opinion . 
we did n't care for this product at all it seemed to have a funny after taste to it was n't worth the cost we were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty . 
what am i missing \? br br this mix creates a pretty much tasteless pancake i 've tried adding vanilla and cinnamon i use real maple syrup on top i cook them in fresh bacon grease the pancakes are still , just , blah it 's like they absorb and negate the flavors br br the pancakes cook ok the texture is fine just absolutely no flavor br br wo n't get this again considering pitching the rest of what i have . 
i bought the mix at the same time as the oster 3874 waffle maker and have been pleased with the results light , well baked waffles that tasted good my problems with the mix were first the expense , secondly that the mix is very finely ground and flies around when poured and there may some sort of perfume added to it it simply smells too good br br i am happy with the product but will probably not reorder it . 
part of me wants to ask for a refund i bought this package of k cups because i wanted a mix of teas when i got my package i was very disappointed to see hardly any teas in the package i know they substituted based on availability but i think it 's completely misleading to substitutes with products that do n't pertain to the packaged theme i got a mix of gingerbread and eggnog disappointing ! . 
this is not a summer sampler br br the majority of this sampler was hot , including hot eggnog , hot apple cider , hot gingerbread coffee , hot caramel apple , and golden french toast coffee br br sound like the perfect brewed over ice k cup to you \? this was the totality of iced drinks vanilla iced coffee , peach iced tea , and unsweetened black iced tea br br additionally , there were only 8 varieties rather than the 9 listed on the description br br i literally thought they might have mixed my summer drinks for holiday drinks , but it was clearly labeled summer sampler br br even worse , this item does not generally qualify for a refund beware ! . 
thought i was ordering summer tea flavors , got leftover winter garbage i will not buy from this seller again i hate iced coffee , much less gingerbread and eggnog flavors ! i cannot believe i just spent that amount of money on crap that i will not ever drink should have waited until walmart carried it ! does keurig know this stuff is being sold under such false advertisements \? yes , i know it says flavors may be substituted that would be fine if they were more teas if i had wanted gross iced coffee flavors , i would have ordered such ! br br on the up side , the peach tea i received was very good otherwise , do n't waste your money ! . 
i got two teas and one type of iced coffe and the rest were holiday coffees and apple cider ! spicy eggnog \? gingerbread \? bait and swtich the only redeeming factor amazon was great and issued me a refund . 
there should be an option for a 0 star rating because that is what i would rate this item br first , the sampling was to include 9 varieties but included only 7 it appears that the two flavors out of stock were not substituted with two other flavors but instead a few more of the remaining flavors were tossed in the box i had expected that when a limited edition coffee flavor such as island coconut was out of stock , it would be replaced with a different limited edition coffee flavor same thing for the half and half lemonade br second , the order was not balanced of the 7 flavors i did receive , only 2 were coffees , the remaining 5 were teas br the concept of a summer sampler set is a good one but the execution here was an epic fail the order is being returned today . 
we definately got a nice assortment of k cups but were really looking forward to trying the peach tea which was not included in our shipment i overlooked the line stating some flavors may be substituted but one of our substitutions was a hot coffee mix of eggnog , french toast , and a third winter type flavor slightly misleading from what is pictured . 
do n't get me wrong , i wanted to try the holiday sampler \( mostly coffee \) but i ordered the summer sampler with teas there were just a couple peach teas , sweet teas , and unsweetened black teas i did n't send it back because i wanted to try the holiday sampler almost everything i got was the eggnog coffee , apple ciders , ginger bread coffee , and french toast coffee the box was labeled summer sampler , so i'm sure that this was an accident i did n't contact the seller because i ordered it while i was gearing up for finals and now there is no contact seller button so seller , if you see this review message me and we can talk . 
really amazon \? ! nothing says delicious summer treat to me like a nice cup of egg nog and when i am not craving egg nog in the summer , it 's gingerbread i 'd really like do n't buy this , it sucks i'm probably just going to toss it if there was the ability to rate this with a negative number i 'd say 3 . 
i do not consider gingerbread , spicy eggnog , caramel apple cider , spiced apple cider summer items you cleaned off your self at my expense ! very disappointed ! . 
i was hoping for the gift box , instead i got a cardboard box full of a mixed bag of k cups do n't get me wrong , if the price is right then i have no problem , but the price was a little misleading i was under the impression that this would be in a sampler box , not a warehouse box it looks like a mix and match of k cups that fell out of other packages or were returned buyer beware . 
the teas seem to brew really strong so use a large glass or dilute after unless you really like strong tea br br it 's a good pack to figure out which flavors you want to buy in bulk . 
i got a bag of these and the veggie sticks have n't tried the veggie ones yet the sweet potato didnt taste like sweet potato to me just tasted like rice flour and cinnamon and brown sugar tastes like that cereal cinnamon toast crunch i put the the so called skinny sticks in a bowl and added milk taste better ! . 
i ordered ka me rice crunch crackers , plain i received ka me gluten free rice crackers , original , all natural unfortunately , they have soy products in this cracker and therefore i ca n't eat it this looks different from the picture that came with the crackers i ordered apparently i ca n't return the box of crackers . 
you wo n't believe how many ways this product has saved my life ! i only gave it one star because i'm so dehydrated from drinking regular water all week because i ran out of money before my penta ran out when i can afford another shipment , i 'll jack it back up to 5 stars ! br seriously , folks some waters just run through your system and you pee them all out right away not penta ! it sticks to your ribs like oatmeal , restoring your body 's natural tendencies to develop sympathetic electrolytic rehydration but it wo n't weigh you down ! br other things i have noticed about this product br br i accidentally dropped my cell phone into a glass of it , and when i pulled it out , it had better reception ! br i was going to discipline my kids after they tried to clean my computer with it , until i discovered that it improved its functionality ! br i threw some jumping beans into the bottle , and the next day i had a pair of baby pogo sticks growing in my refrigerator ! br br hey , if you fill up your solar shower with this stuff , you wo n't even need soap it comes at a price , but it 's so super ! br br if you are tired with the uninvigorating , boring old swill other people call water , or are lethargic from all that unenhanced blah that 's so bad they ca n't attach a higher market value to , and you 're so over the cheap , readily available and monitored crap your mcburbia proffers , then look no further . 
the site does n't list the ingredients for their products online had i known the product was full of trans fats i would not have ordered it watch your labels partially hydrated partially hydrogenated you have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public in the future i will not order a product that does n't list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchases br br did try the product and found it tasteless no heat spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth , must be from the wax i was going to send it to my son in college but tossed it in the trash instead the sad thing is that they do not have to use trans fats to get flavor they just do n't care . 
i first tried these in a bundle of other gluten free products , and it was so fresh so i decided to buy it in bulk , and the expiration date was only three months i ended up given most of it away because i did n't have time to eat all of the 12 packages i received the taste is ok , not too sweet , but i found myself getting sick of it fast . 
i bought this because it 's organic cheese puff my son love gerber cheese lil' crunchies i thought he may like this too i subscribe it once a month now there is 4 cans not open the idea of mixing cheese and carrot is great , but there is no taste for this cheese snack there is no cheese flavor in the puff my son opened the can and keeps giving the puff to me my son love happybaby 's yogurt melts , beef stew , happy baby banana beet blueberry and spinach , mango and pear this cheese puff does not work for him . 
the title of my review says it all \( as long as it did n't get cut off \) these have a lot more air in them than the gerber little crunchies these crush extremely easily and get dust crumbs all over the place also , they do not taste nearly as good as the gerber little crunchies they might be better for you , and i like that it has a hint of veggies in it , but my 17 month old is n't very happy with them she 'll snack on them if that 's her only option and she 's really hungry , but she definitely will not choose them we first got these several months ago and she 's had the same reaction to them every time since then . 
i really wanted my kids to love it these are very convenient on the go and should be delicious or so it seemed unfortunately , none of the kids cared for it it tastes like stage 1 baby food \( very bland \) and is very runny too , so it can get quite messy if you squeeze a little too hard or if the child drops it . 
i know these are super trendy right now , and i totally wanted to love this product \( or , to be more exact , i wanted my toddler to love this product \) he took one taste , handed it back to me , and said , why you gave me baby food , mom \? i tasted it , and he is right it tastes just like jarred baby food same consistency \( not any thicker \) , too if your kid likes the packaging , great if your kid does n't , then it is just really , really expensive baby food i'm going to give the rest to my baby , as the toddler is not the least bit interested . 
this flavor is awful ! we absolutely love all the other flavors but goji cacao maca is really difficult to get down i give all the other flavors 5 stars ! . 
we have been feeding this to our dogs for over a year over the past few months , we have had a problem with the cases of grammy 's pot pie cans some cans were full of chunks of fat and a thick lard like gravy with no veggies , and some cases were fine with chicken and veggies , etc what happened to truth in labeling \? we also had the problem with the cans being only half full sometimes our dogs were getting bad diarhea from the fat in the food so we had to stop giving them merrick br they need to start testing their food again it used to be great look at the old reviews from last year and before . 
i 've been feeding this wet food to my dogs for 3 years , and as my husband has said if you through it in a crock pot and served it to me for dinner i would have no idea it was dog food but i am a little upset with the fact that the cans are n't full in this last case some were even only half full i have 4 dogs and this stuff is n't cheap . 
please think twice about purchasing this product , especially if you have a small breed dog i was lured by the cute , gimmicky labeling and sold by the ingredient list , but i twice fed merrick canned food to both of my dogs , and both times , both dogs were diagnosed with pancreatitis an illness which is dangerous , extremely painful to the animal , and which requires hospitalization i'm not sure if the fat content in those particular cans was high , or if merrick uses an ingredient additive that somehow sickened both of my \( unrelated \) dogs , but this food made them very ill after their second hospitalization for pancreatitis , i spoke with other folks who had stopped feeding merrick to their small breed dogs for the same reason the food caused vomiting , diarrhea , and lethargy in their pets . 
i had heard this was wonderful canned food , so i tried it for my very fussy schnauzer i was first surprised to see a layer of fat on the top when i opened the can i scraped that off and added a couple spoonfuls to her dry and she sniffed it and walked away she does seem to like the merrick bg dry food i chose the buffalo flavor and my girl says this is a winner . 
my little lhasa apso mix was diagnosed with diabetes a couple of months ago , so i found merrick 's grammy 's pot pie to be low glycemic , and decided to try it he loves this food ! it has chunks of potatoes , carrots , and peas , not to mention chicken and apples the only downside about ordering it from amazon is the delivery method the day the food was delivered , a van pulled up in front of my house and left the 5 cases of food i had ordered outside of my chain link fence next to the mailbox needless to say , someone could have taken it if i had n't seen the delivery woman drop it off i'm also disabled , and if it had n't been for my next door neighbor being outside at the time , i could n't have gotten the cases of food into my house without her help many of the cans were also extremely dented delivering items this way is not acceptable i would have given this review 5 stars if it had n't been for the delivery . 
i have a special needs pet and searched for the right food since amazon has been a five star resource i chose to have pot pie shipped many of the cans are dented so i have to toss them or return this is a big hassle but would not ever feed a dented can to my beloved boy best to purchase at the pet store , evidently . 
i ordered through source in the past and cancelled my membership due to the excessive charges every month i was happy to look on amazon and find that i could purchase for much cheaper and use my prime account this tea is not the same as the one that came in the black box the orignal tea is brown and this tea is green the pamphlet is the same inside as the other and the fragile tea bags are the same but the tea is different this one comes packaged much preetier but it does not taste the same i have lost 20 pounds in the last 2 months by drinking this tea in the morning and only water throughout the day that is my only diet change i used the other tea for a month and half and this new tea for 3 weeks now i dont want to stop taking the tea just is in case it is the contributor to my weight loss the next order i will try the other tea that you have to pay for shipping on i hope i can find this orginal stuff because this is not it . 
so far , nothing extremely impressive the taste to be honest is n't anything special \( i 've had much better \) and for the price you get what you pay for a bit annoyed that the string is super cheap and always falls off but it came nicely packaged and arrived much faster than i expected \( by like 5 days \) so i suppose that 's a plus all in all , if you 're looking for something extravagant , keep looking as for the 'benefits' , have n't really noticed anything new but i 'll keep drinking for a couple weeks and see how that goes , then update my review till then , yeah maybe i should i invested in something else \( but since it was barely any money i guess i did n't do too bad \) . 
just got my teabags today , and the first bag i made tea with the part of the teabag where the string is connected to the bag tore across the bag after seeping the bag remained intact though the second bag , while unwrapping the teabag the tag ripped the bag right open br br the tea tasted fine , not very strong like most other oolong teas the quality of the tea bag is like some flimsy material two out of two broke i guess i need to be more careful with the others . 
holy cow ! i have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this ! also , it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs ! use it in your garden , do n't eat it ! . 
i had high hopes for this product when i first opened the package because the noodles had a great texture and the sauce looked appealing the food was easy to prepare at my workplace however to me , the taste was very oily and flavorless i'm a big peanut satay fan and was expected more spice in the flavor . 
i love peanut satay this product is truly terrible in no way does it resemble that dish oily , salty and tastes lousy do n't waste your money on this brand . 
this is not real peanut satay but for the price it is not bad i like to get these and keep them in my desk at work for the days that i do n't have time to go out to lunch these are really easy to make just mix together the cooked noodles and the bag of sauce and microwave for about 2 minutes you will not get a restaurant quality meal out of this but it is decent for just over 2 00 a box the box says it is 2 servings but if you are not mixing in any meat or anything , it really is only 1 serving . 
very bitter and not nearly as thick as expected very runny , actually there are better brands out there . 
hi , br br my first grandson was born and i wanted everything under the sun to celebrate ! this is a wonderful idea that has been around for a very long time ! however everything was fine and wonderful except the fact that they just were n't fresh these little bubble gum cigars were as hard as a rock ! the moral of the story is that being a fun item the shipping was as much as the cigars themselves at least they could have been fresh and not hard . 
i purchased this item to celebrate the birth of my grandson i should have opted for real cigars , they might have tasted better these cigars were very hard and hurt my teeth to chew not to mention that these gum cigars were much too sweet . 
ordered some from an amazon fulfilled associate normal amazon shipping etc the cigars were cracked and stale how does chewing gum shatter and break \? no way it was fit for consumption br easy return process . 
i 've had a lot of san marzano tomatoes in my day , both fresh and canned , and typically they are the best tomatoes on the planet i opened the first can from this order , and the tomatoes were n't very good at all nothing like i was used to i later noticed that the can does not have the d o p certified label , like the photo on the amazon page does these tomatoes are not d o p certified , and are not real san marzano tomatoes they are a cheap imitation the seller tried to mimic the label of real san marzano tomatoes so they could sell them for a higher price i would recommend you stay away from these you can get better tomatoes for a fourth the price at your local grocery store . 
the label is misleading cento actually sells two kind of san marzano with the same label other than one that says d o p certified you will receive the one w o the d o p if you order from amazon i have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing cento sells ones are d o p and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late the true d o p ones i have to say make the best sauce ! you can taste the difference . 
buyer beware ! the label on the amazon site clearly states d o p certified but the product received does not match the site label and does not state d o p certified this is bait and switch and i will file a complaint with amazon . 
you order \( and pay for \) d o p certified san marzano tomatoes but you will receive certified which means absolutely nothing a true sm tomato will have an eu d o p emblem on the label plus the corsorzio san marzano stamp this is false advertising if you enlarge the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the stamps you will not receive this dop label you will receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the cento name typical marketing hoodwinking amazon refuses to take returns on this item , so beware . 
since a dop product is not readily available at my local grocery stores , i got really excited when i saw the photo of this product at the amazon website because the photo states that this product is d o p certified br br but when i received the shipment , it was a huge disappointment it was a different product than what the photo promised \( i can buy the one that was delivered to me at my local grocery stores very easily \) very disappointing . 
i 've used cento san marzano dop certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoes br that said , this is the 1st time i 've ordered this item from amazon and all 12 cans arrived completely dented and banged up ! br terrible presentation for an expensive item br as an aside , none of the cans i received has a dop certified label but only certified and no serial on the side of the cans so i'm not sure if these tomatoes are actually dop certified or not \? \? \? . 
the amazon product info claims they are a certified organic product the picture claims dop certified neither appears to be true the cans i received were just certified , and it did n't say by who there is no usda organic label either i also knew all these things before i bought them since they are well documented in the amazon reviews already , so i was n't surprised by what i received br br on the plus side , they are better tomatoes than i can buy canned in the grocery stores locally , so i'm happy enough with them , and i used reward points from my amazon com visa to buy them , so they were essentially free to me br br would i buy them again \? maybe if could n't get any of the strianese d o p certified san marzano tomatoes , then yes i probably would as i said , they are tasty and i do like them better than what i can buy locally , but they are n't the top tomato when it comes to what i can mail order . 
the can that is shown says d o p certified but when my relative ordered them from amazon com , the cans that were shipped only indicate certified one can buy these non dop at any walmart what do they mean by certified \? certified as to what \? br br unfortunately , the venders are making fools of amazon com as a consequence , i am staying away from cento products entirely fool me and amazon once , shame on cento fool me and amazon twice , shame on me and amazon there is no way i can make this review fun ! . 
these are not dop they 're just certified which means nothing significant they should go a step further with a little more nonsense and write department certified real dop tomatoes are much better . 
they tomatoes are certified san marzano but not dop like the item shows in picture i called amazon and they sent me another box of 12 for free to fix issue the new shipment was still certified not dop so please know this tomatoes are ok but not the best fyi . 
i purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago , and the cans were so badly bent and warped my can opener wo n't open them i complained to amazon and they shipped another case out right away but those cans are worse than the first case ! i wo n't order again . 
the product image is misleading the image has the tomatoes as d o p certified , but the tomatoes i received are not . 
merchandise was not damaged during shipment but supplier send me damaged and incorrect merchandise 3 4 of the cans were badly dented and the cans they shipped were not dop certified they sent me lower standard merchandise received full refund from amazzon . 
received different than pictured labels just say certified not d o p certified do n't know if that is the same and after a couple of orders i am not going to put the effort in to find out br also came with basil i want tomatoes only not basil br a couple cans dented like others have said br my case was 44 now its 60 br i'm over the tomato thing i 'll buy what i want in the store . 
of the 12 cans shipped 11 of them had very , very serious dents in them i'm not talking dings , i talking serious dents so dented that i truly thought of throwing them away my husband stopped me though because at 5 a can he felt that it was too wasteful in my local grocery store , items this dented are put into a reduced price bin , because they usually do n't move otherwise a href http www amazon com gp product b002c4hz00 cento san marzano certified tomatoes , 28 ounce cans \( pack of 12 \) a . 
it 's a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies ! i'm very disappointed when i noticed that the same kind sold in china is even better . 
do you really want to be feeding your baby a bottle of corn syrup \? \? \? br i used this until i realized that i switched to gerber , its so much better for your baby . 
if your child is truly lactose intolerant , this product is great if fussiness gas is an issue , then consider staying with similac advance or another formula that is made primarily with milk this product did seem to create less fussiness in our baby , but honestly i think the dr brown bottles made a bigger impact make your own trade off between fussiness vs nutrition , just be aware of which formulas are made with corn sweeteners and which are truly milk based br br it 's misleading for the company to label the product as milk based when it has minor ingredients derived from milk read the list of ingredients \( below \) i found the ingredients on the parent company 's website \( abbott nutrition \) do n't try to find the ingredients list on the simlac website it 's not there \( perhaps for good reason \) br br similac sensitive ingredients br corn maltodextrin , sugar \( sucrose \) , milk protein isolate , high oleic safflower oil , soy oil , coconut oil , galactooligosaccharides less than 1 0 of the following c cohnii oil , m alpina oil , beta carotene , lutein , lycopene , calcium phosphate , potassium citrate , modified corn starch , potassium chloride , magnesium chloride , monoglycerides , soy lecithin , carrageenan , calcium carbonate , ascorbic acid , choline chloride , sodium chloride , ferrous sulfate , choline bitartrate , taurine , m inositol , dl alpha tocopheryl acetate , zinc sulfate , l carnitine , niacinamide , calcium pantothenate , cupric sulfate , thiamine chloride hydrochloride , vitamin a palmitate , riboflavin , pyridoxine hydrochloride , folic acid , manganese sulfate , potassium iodide , phylloquinone , biotin , sodium selenate , vitamin d3 , cyanocobalamin , potassium hydroxide , and nucleotides \( adenosine 5' monophosphate , cytidine 5' monophosphate , disodium guanosine 5' monophosphate , disodium uridine 5' monophosphate \) br sourced from milk \( gos \) br a source of docosahexaenoic acid \( dha \) br a source of arachidonic acid \( ara \) br br similac advance ingredients br nonfat milk , lactose , high oleic safflower oil , soy oil , coconut oil , galactooligosaccharides , whey protein concentrate less than 0 5 of the following c cohnii oil , m alpina oil , beta carotene , lutein , lycopene , ascorbic acid , calcium carbonate , potassium citrate , soy lecithin , monoglycerides , potassium chloride , carageenan , magnesium chloride , ferrous sulfate , choline bitartrate , choline chloride , taurine , calcium phosphate , potassium phosphate , m inositol , zinc sulfate , niacinamide , d alpha tocopheryl acetate , calcium pantothenate , l carnitine , riboflavin , vitamin a palmitate , cupric sulfate , thiamine chloride hydrochloride , pyridoxine hydrochloride , folic acid , manganese sulfate , phylloquinone , biotin , sodium selenate , vitamin d3 , cyanocobalamin , sodium chloride , potassium hydroxide , and nucleotides \( adenosine 5' monophosphate , cytidine 5' monophosphate , disodium guanosine 5' monophosphate , disodium uridine 5' monophosphate \) br sourced from milk \( gos \) br a source of docosahexaenoic acid \( dha \) br a source of arachidonic acid \( ara \) br guanosine 5' monophosphate , disodium uridine 5' monophosphate \) br sourced from milk \( gos \) br a source of docosahexaenoic acid \( dha \) br a source of arachidonic acid \( ara \) . 
i decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy however , this formula made him more gassy the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby i tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that did n't work . 
if your newborn cries inconsolably , you should try a lactose free formula right away even though they 're so expensive however , the ingredients may not look so good it 's important to shop around if you 're going to use a lactose free formula lactose free formulas always are the most expensive and this one is loaded with processed corn syrup solids br br from wikipedia baby colic \( also known as infant colic , three month colic , infantile colic and colic \) is a condition in which an otherwise healthy baby cries or screams frequently and for extended periods without any discernible reason you 'll know it if it happens to your baby , and it 's awful to not be able to do anything to immediately relieve your baby it contains dha , ara and iron , but all baby formulas do because it is required by law br br lactose free formula is expensive is because it goes through a very specialized and difficult manufacturing process , i'm told by the company 's public relations representative so much food in the u s is prepared with corn syrup solids , so that should n't be a worry , i'm told ok , but i notice the obesity rate is high . 
we just changed to gerber good start gentle due to sugar in this product this did seem to work better than a couple other formula but i decided to try something else when i read about sugar we just changed over to gerber good start gentle and it does \( so far \) seem to be working better he is still gassy but he has less pain and doesnt seem in nearly as much discomfort when eating \( he is a little colic but still loves to eat \) i do this this is a good product and i'm sure the sugar is safe , i just would rather not give extra sugar at this age \( 8 weeks \) good luck ! ! . 
the description of this product is disceptive this product was represented as a powder , but it is not a powder , it 's a granule it is nothing more than shredded coconut and does n't even dissolve in a high speed commercial blender br br unless you are using this product to manufacture a dark chocolate coated coconut patty , to me it is useless my intention was to use it as an additive in a healthy shake it ended up ruining the shake as i had to resort to chewing the undissolved , tasteless coconut pieces rather than drinking the shake br br additionally , the way the product was packaged , there was no protective cardboard preventing the slashing the top package when the box was opened br br if i could have rated this product zero stars , i would have the only redeeming quality was that it was rather inexpensive i gave one package away for free to a patient who loves coconut and she gave it back to me two days later complaining that it was terrible ! . 
i bought this same brand from an online indian grocery store that usually has excellent products i was able to turn it into cream butter , using my super blender and adding some water , but it barely had any flavor i usually buy the chao kah brand of coconut cream \( which is quite tasty and flavorful \) and read another review for a different product for making your own coconut cream my complaint is not the shreds or texture mine was just virtually tasteless . 
i bought this for our young son and was disappointed in several aspects of this dispenser br br \( 1 \) it 's made of cheap plastic and arrived w the globe scratched and cracked br br \( 2 \) the top does n't screw on it just pops off w very little exertion br br \( 3 \) part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is coin operated what the description on amazon does n't tell you , however , is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy furthermore , when the crank is just barely turned , the candy \( usually two pieces \) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w o your hand there to catch it a young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy br br \( 4 \) the dispenser only came w enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe br br \( 5 \) it is very much over priced at 29 99 . 
i was disappointed when i received this dispenser it said a large dispenser it looks like something for a child to play with i bought it for my husband to put in his man cave he is a huge m m fan i buy him a tree ornament each year from the m m collections i was hoping it had more substance to it i also did not realize i was unable to return this item . 
traditional english muffins are usually fat free or having very little fat this little challenger should be called something else all together br br closer to what i would say a croissant is , having all of the buttery taste and fat to go with it br br terrific if that 's what you are looking for in an english muffin but not what i'm looking for i would rather save the fat for a chocolate dessert . 
i really like the frozen corn muffin tops , but the mix resulted in a dryer product i used the paper muffin liners and i think these might have added to the dryness . 
i found this muffin to be dry and very disappointing if i cut it up and put it in a bowl with yogurt , it was ok would not order this flavor again . 
the picture shown is for three packages and the price is fair for three but i was only sent one but was charged for three also the item sent was not the item shown i can buy the item shipped all day long at any local grocery store i went to amazon because i was looking for the type shown br br when i contacted the seller and told them about this they said they would give me partial credit for the item but nothing for shipping seeing as how i was shipped something i did n't order i should be entitled to a full refund including shipping i was not offered that br br if i could give this seller negative stars i would any future buyers beware . 
too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest . 
the tea bags work well with loose tea and buying the pack of six makes this a good value but what you 're not told is that the bags are the large size , better made for large pots and not single cups . 
was shocked at the skinny size of this item ! ! they are five inches long as i expected , because that 's the size i wanted and ordered , but ca n't be any bigger around than even a pencil and that 's a big stretch ! ! wow , i'm sure disappointed considering the cost 7 and shipping wo n't be ordering these again br of course my dog likes them ok , but would n't call them her fav by any means \( will i send them back \? do n't know if it 's worth the hassle at this point but i will not recommend them either because of the size quality and high price compared to so many other products to choose from ! keep looking is my advice \) br the other beefeaters' products i ordered well met my standards this one was a dud ! ! what 's the old saying \? buyer beware \? i fell into that trap big time ! br here 's the product link at this time br br a href http www amazon com gp product b00176aidu beefeaters great fillin porkhide rolls with meaty chicken filling , 5 inch a br br wish you luck if you try this product but again buyer beware ! ! br br update 2 15 2012 my little dog got very sick not too long after i wrote this review i contacted cust service with even more reason to not like this item and they refunded my money ! ! how 's that for customer care \? \? \) great ! ! thank you amazon com you are terrific ! ! . 
the treats were ok , my main complaint is they were small about the size of a lifesaver which made it hard to give them to my medium size dog as a treat one treat just di not do it this package should be labeled for toy or small dogs . 
too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest . 
i bought 2 bottles of this tart cherry juice because they were cheaper than tart is smart they may be providing the anti oxidents that they say but they completely failed me in helping to sleep better at night i returned 1 bottle to amazon went back to tart is smart i used to wake up 3 4 times a night have trouble getting back to sleep being nearly 80 retired , i can sleep in if i choose with my tis formula , i get to sleep fairly quick , wake up 7 hours later get anothert hour or two after visiting the bathroom this product may work much better for you but i found one that works for me will stick with it forever i hope to read your opinion of this product soon \? . 
too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest . 
i ordered this item in a large quanity , but wanted the items packaged as shown they were for favors in a holiday bag for the company employees when they arrived a few were packaged as shown but the bulk were loose if i had know they would come like this i would have gone to costo or some other discount store for the purchase the cute little box that would have helped make them special and what i thought i paid for was missing . 
when tea is decaffeinated , is all the flavor removed \? or is this just lousy tea \? in any case , all you get from a couple of these tea bags in a \( 12 oz \) mug of hot water is hot water ! true , the hot water is slightly brownish after five minutes of steeping , but there 's no tea flavor at all very disappointing . 
i love these cookies , but this paticular batch was stale , very hard , i had to dip them in my coffe to eat them easily . 
if you are ordering cookies , beware , the 'cookies' arrived in crumbles , so , if you want a box of stale crumbs order away \) . 
two of aunt gussie 's cookies contain 23 of daily fat allowance ! the cookies are so full of grease they fall apart they may be sugar free and gluten free , but they make it up with mostly fat ! i ca n't even give them to my grandchildren ! . 
they taste nice , but they made my stomach hurt and gave me a bit of flatulence issues \( because of the chicory root fiber \) it also made me bloated . 
carabou mahogony is the worst tasting cup of coffee i have ever had , and i 've been drinking coffee for over 4 decades it tastes just like a piece of burnt toast the only way i can make it palatable is to put it over ice , add lots of vanilla sugar syrup and milk i 've got to find some way to justify the purchase and icing it seems to help . 
too mild for me i like a strong flavor my wife likes this coffee has enough flavor and boldness to keep it enjoyable and not feeling like water downed coffee if you like strong , bold coffee , you will be disappointed for a mild coffee , i found this good , but not good enough to warrant the higher cost over many of the other brands br br i will not be re ordering caribou mahogany my wife prefers donut shop brand over this again , not strong enough for me , but still makes a good cup of coffee . 
this coffee is inoffensive , but not strong enough for my tastes i do use cream , and i'm sure that makes a difference . 
this coffee is not really bold in my opinion it falls more along medium roast flavor it 's a decent , smooth coffee , but i did n't think really bold like all k cups though seriously overpriced ! . 
if you like strong coffee , as i do this coffee is over rated i found it weak , with a sickening after taste . 
this coffee is very full bodied , and has a great aroma however , it is the only k cup coffee i 've had that has a bitter aftertaste i would still drink it if someone offered me a cup , but i wo n't buy it again . 
honestly , i'm not sure why so many folks like this coffee in their reviews it 's a little weak but mostly just does n't have a rich flavor it is really missing something i drink coffee black maybe it tastes better with cream and sugar \? before buying this coffee , i had been drinking starbuck 's french roast and folger 's black silk , both of which taste so much better than this coffee . 
we loved this product and i just received my new order i noticed the packing changed which made me check the label the ingredients and nutritional information has changed ! br br old ingredients nutrition \( sample \) br natural coconut water br natural pineapple juice br cane juice br vit c br natural fruit flavor br sodium 115mg br potassium 299mg br sugar 16g br vit c 172 br calcium 1 3 br iron 1 8 br br new ingredients nutrition \( sample \) br coconut water br pineapple juice br sugar br ascorbic acid br natural flavor br sodium 45mg br potassium 425mg br sugar 20g br calcium 2 br iron 0 br magnesium 2 br vit c 210 br 96 juice br br maybe the new box is misprinted as it says 96 juice and the packaging clearly says a splash of pineapple and other natural flavors br br no thank you i 'll be cancelling my subscription i do n't why the change . 
please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product ! we just cancelled our subscription of 8 cases per month because the new formula is disgusting ! not buying again unless the change back to the old version ! . 
ugh i tried this as a replacement for the coconut water with pineapple that was available before in the automatic ship program this stuff is awful it 's got added sugar , which is not needed at all and actually makes the drink taste pretty gross never getting this stuff again \( and i do love coconut water , in general , as it is a fantastic hydrator and tastier than gatorade well , usually not this stuff \) . 
almost gagged at first taste i have used other coconut based products \( water , milk , cooking oil , etc \) and this is the first time i have been disappointed my teenage kids hated it my son is health food nut and drinks all the protein shakes and he could n't stand it i am sure done is not the healthiest , but one you try that , there is no comparison in flavor tolerance . 
to me , this tastes more like pineapple juice than coconut there is an underlying hint of coconut , i know the water is n't strongly flavored , but i was n't expecting so much pineapple this is tangy and sweet it is alright package is smaller , but i do n't think i could handle too much more of it in one sitting i am not thrilled with their unflavored coconut water , it is too tangy sour to me , so with the pineapple it helps cover up that funkiness for me not sure i 'd buy this again still in search of the one i first tried and fell in love with , but so far not finding anything as light and fresh tasting . 
i did n't expect coconut water with a splash of pineapple juice to taste quite so salty , even if it does replace electrolytes , so that was off putting it 's not really bad , especially over ice , but i wo n't be ordering any more of it . 
this is good but not as good as the standard coconut water in this brand the container is smaller , there is no straw , and i like the taste of the plain one better it is ok . 
i 've had amy and brians coconut water yum ! , vico 's plain in the tetra pack great ! \( the ones in the plastic bottle and some in the larger tetra packs are from concentrate blah and yuck do n't get those ! \) , and the ones in the glass bottles green cover ca n't remember the name , but pure coconut water great too br br this , one with pineapple no good the added cane juice is superfluous to the natural sweetness of coconut water and pineapple juice it makes the water taste 'thicker' and not so healthy br br i wish these brands can just stick to the name of the drinks in their ingredients ! \( i e coconut water and pineapple juice ! no more ! \) . 
i love coconut and pineapple , but i was not wild about the one coconut water with a splash of pineapple it was n't bad it had a mildly coconutty \( though not sweet \) flavor , but it just was n't anything special it was rather bland , and i had a hard time finishing it as it started to warm up since i'm not a competitive athlete and do n't have any great need to replenish my electrolytes , i 'd rather just drink water . 
my top line advice if you want coconut water with a touch of pineapple , get the vita coco , not this one br br size the size is 8 5 fl oz per package i did n't pay close attention when ordering , and expected the larger , 11 5 oz size not a big deal , and was my fault , but it 's a little too small to be useful br br taste ick i love coconut water i love pineapple juice i love lightly flavored coconut water this tastes like none of the above the flavor is sickly sweet \( ingredients included added sugar \) , and with none of the nice mellow coconut flavor of other coconut waters i 've tried might as well be a processed kids drink br br alternatives while i actually prefer o n e 's regular , unflavored coconut water over other brands , the vita coco coconut water with a splash of pineapple is far superior to this one it comes in a larger package , does n't have added sugar , has more vitamins and nutrients \( this one is diluted with sugar water \) , and tastes like you 're drinking it fresh on the beach this one is just not great . 
i wanted to try this juice as i'm a big fan of coconut flavoured products given that it claims to have a splash of pineapple , i was expecting a light pina colada flavour br br on opening the package , i could smell the hint of pineapple , and i 'd say the taste of pineapple is a bit stronger than the coconut water probably because i 've mostly tasted coconut milk and not water , i 'd say this was nothing like what i expected it 's not bad for thirst quenching , but it was n't my favourite drink in terms of taste . 
hi every one i just wanted to share some of my experience with you about this product first off all it taste pretty good but its kinda sugary and salty its an ok drink but when you think about it and you compare it to others this drink is not as healthy as others its more like a juice drink than a healthy one compared to vitacoco it has more calories , twice the sodium , half the potassium and almost half the vitamin c this drink also has less magnesium , phosphorous , and 4 times less calcium the only this the drink does have over vitacoco is the 1 less gram of sugar overall pay the extra price and get a better drink for your body and if you dont believe me go to the websites and check the facts below or check it out on their web site br br o n e coconut water with splash of pineapple br calories 75 br fat 0 br cholesterol 0 br sodium \( 115mg \) 4 8 br potassium \( 299mg \) 8 5 br carbs \( 17g \) 6 br fiber 1 2 br sugar 16g br protein 0g br br vitamin c 172 br calcium 1 3 br magnesium 0 br phosphorous 0 br iron 1 8 br br compared to br br vitacoco with splash of coconut br calories 80 br fat 0 br cholesterol 0 br sodium \( 40mg \) 2 br potassium \( 740mg \) 19 br carbs \( 21g \) 7 br fiber 0 br sugar 21g br protein 0g br br vitamin c 240 br calcium 5 br magnesium 10 br phosphorous 5 br iron 0 . 
i'm usually into pineapple and coconut drinks , but this drink just did n't taste all that great to me the taste does n't resemble anything close to a 'pina colada' flavor and it was actually difficult to taste the pineapple or coconut in it it just tastes tangy and a little sour like water that has a bit of sugar and sour ness to it yeah , not really a taste i crave i'm not sure if everyone had this reaction to this drink , but it just did n't appeal to me i really wanted to like it though , because as i said before i usually love pineapple coconut drinks . 
this product is billed as an all natural anti oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage sort of like all natural gatorade with anti oxidents br br like a sports beverage , it too is also kinda bland i love some of the gatorade flavors , some not so much this drink falls into the not so much category for me br br it is sorta sweet , sorta pineapple y , and also sorta bland my wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth , like the glass had soap in it still i did n't think it was that bad but the drink really did n't appeal to me br br in the end , yes , this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch but as a sports drink , i think i 'll stick with plain old gatorade it 's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving br br if going the all natural route with your juices drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars . 
i received a single 8 5 once container of one coconut water with a splash of pineapple as part of the amazon vine program for review br br it would have been nice if it had come with a straw , especially considering the price of the product now as to the splash of pineapple , well it must not have been a very big splash , because i never did taste any pineapple so what did i taste \? it is hard to describe it does n't taste like coconut or cane sugar or any natural fruit flavor br br to be honest , it tastes like water , sort of like water with an odd , undefinable extra flavor it 's not a bad flavor or a good flavor , it 's just meh ! flavor i do n't care how healthy this drink is supposed to be , for it 's price , it should have a better flavor , or just have a flavor br br and as a thirst quencher , it does n't equal up to gatorade or even a lemonade i feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst . 
coconut water with a hint of pineapple , shipped to the us from indonesia , packaged in \( usually \) non recyclable , disposable containers , and catering to the sports drink market \( good source of electrolytes \) \? br br i took a 8 5 ounce container and poured 6 servings , for 4 teenagers and 2 adults first impression \? the teens \( serious athletes \) were not told what the drink was , but i did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink br br the result \? no negative votes , but no one would choose it over existing drinks everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly it leaves a strange feeling in my mouth , one teen said this was probably the coconut water it had a residual flavor and feel br br there was no straw included with the package , so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife it 's mostly \( cane \) sugar water , so why bother \? br br but the biggest issue is the waste coconut sugar water from indonesia \? what 's the carbon footprint of this product \? and the container has 2 recycle symbols on it , but , like milk cartons , it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill br br bottom line \? it 's not that tasty , being little more than sugar water , and the transport and packaging waste really do n't fit into a culture \( for me \) focusing on sustainability . 
sojo 's diet lacks calcium , and if fed as directed will cause severe metabolic bone disease in your dog this diet requires supplementation with a balanced calcium phosphorous additive to be safe . 
it does n't have a whole lot of flavor , but most light roasts do n't it does have a unique flavor , but is kind of rich and tiring , so i recommend you mix it with other coffees to make it taste better and make you other bland coffees taste a little better . 
this paste is actually what first got me into thai curry , at the time i loved it , made it all the time , then i discovered a better brand of curry paste , hand brand curry paste , premium stuff , amazon does n't sell \( , hint to amazon , stock it , but you can get it at , its based in seattle and they import everything from thailand , the flavor of hands brand is so much better the mae ploy , a huge difference , i went back to mae ploy after having hand brand and i didnt even finish my meal , very bland , boring by comparison , also as a side note , these are very small containers , i was used to buy the large ones at my local asian store , these are like 1 4 the size of those ones not a good deal if you can find it locally . 
there 's one important thing not mentioned on their label and that it is not for use in containers ! why hide that info \? to make more sales , of course you 'll only learn that if you read their q a on their website i studied the labels and opened the back label and it 's never mentioned you ca n't use it on potted plants thanks bayer now i have to go back to the store to return it i guess a lot of people have wondered why their potted flowers or roses died , not knowing it 's because of this product if you see your bees dwindle and disappear , then this is the reason will systemic products affect your fragrance of your flowers \? after 3 4 years of use , they will not have a fragrance got earthworms \? you would n't know unless you thoroughly dug through your dirt avoid this ! . 
the active ingredient in this sytemic is imidacloprid it is adbsorbed by the rose plant into the leaves , but not the flowers i learned recently online i have been using this stuff for years and obseved this , but put it down to my not giving the plant enough granules unless you spray the flowers with another product containing the insecticide , the japanese beetles devour the rose flowers and leave th leaves alone br see link br . 
if i could give this product a minus 10 stars , i would there is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder this us has yet to ban this pesticide , but it has already been banned in other countries avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin . 
the taste is good , but i found myself biting down on small bits of lobster shells more often than acceptable this made me not want to finish my bowl of soup . 
this soup is very good tasting if you like seafood , like i do i am finally finishing my case of cans , because it is good food however , i do not plan on getting any more of this particular product because every can has a little something extra bits and pieces of chitinous shell , mostly from the shrimp but also a few hard pieces now and then from the lobster they are small pieces , which means taking small spoonfuls and not biting down hard on anything , and do n't eat the last spoonful i find six to eight pieces of this debris in each can like i said before , i am finishing the case , because it is food and pretty good at that but i just do n't appreciate having to be that careful with my soup . 
it is ok soup , but i expected more , as i love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places this one is very watery and i could not find any lobster there i guess it is ok for the price , but i would never buy this brand of the lobster bisque again . 
for canned soup , it hits the spot decently there 's definitely some lobster flavor and small chunks in it however , the whole thing tastes a little on the fishy side if i was served this in a restaraunt i think i 'd walk out . 
i gave this product a one because zero was n't an option this is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it the only lobster in the soup was some shell it was salty , fishy , nasty and inedible not only that , but 11 of the 12 cans were dented a complete waste of money beyond disappointing it made me angry . 
saw this soup in the supermarket and bought a can opened can heated soup tasted soup dumped soup down drain rinsed mouth with mouthwash enough said . 
as someone who lives and dies by seafood i 've had my fair share of lobster bisque this stuff , while not completely horrible , needs some love before it 's decent the texture is n't quite there , not thin enough to be soup but not up to bisque level either as for the taste , it 's rather bad a little on the bland side as a marylander i reached for the one thing that fixes all things seafood , old bay dumped in a liberal amount and stirred while still on the heat the old bay added a nice taste that made it tolerable to eat doubt i 'll be purchasing this brand again though . 
as far as canned soups go this is ok i was disappointed with the texture , extra unexpected bits \( shell pieces \) and overall quality having been spoiled by living in maine for 20 years before relocating to the south , i tried different brands of canned bisque i have come to the realization that lobster bisque is best when made fresh . 
this is one of the worse tasting soups i 've ever eaten i hated it , and now i have a full case it tastes bitter to me , and my husband would n't even try it only my cat was trying to reach it on the counter ! . 
i advise you to do your own web search to determine how the health risk could affect you the tomally functions as the lobster 's liver and pancreas however , even in the cold scottish waters , dioxin and other harmful agents have been present and there are warnings for the general public i was disappointed to discover this information , so i only ordered the mushroom and seafood flavors . 
i have bought ground flax in the store , there was always a rancid aftertaste this is the best tasting flax i have ever had but , i have to throw it in the coffee grinder , and then pick out little rocks that are barely bigger than the seeds i found this out the hard way after using the seeds whole nothing like working a bite trying to find where the rock you just bit is br br after you grind , sift the powder and black stones will be evident i have about 1 2 per quarter cup of ground mixture perhaps this is something you organic foodies are used to , i am not br br i have only used 1 bag so far , so i cannot comment on whether or not the stones are in the others , but i highly doubt it was a fluke bag . 
i was n't thrilled because i had to pick out tiny bits of gravel the flax seeds themselves were fine , top quality if it were n't for the gravel bits \( that get through the sieve w the seeds , i guess \? \) , this would get 5 stars . 
it was my mistake i thought there were 6 bags rather than 4 so the price per bag is much higher than what i pay at the local grocery for the same product . 
given the recent issues with products made in china i have decided to not buy any food products from there so i wo n't be buying anymore of this snack if they ever switch to made in the u s i 'll buy it again as i did like it . 
this product is made in china i would not believe any claims they make regarding allergy safety and vegan kosher considering mrs may 's markets itself as a healthy product , i was shocked when i glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in china china has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices unsafe toys , dog food , and now we 're supposed to trust them making our health food \? br br not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world i will not buy this product anymore . 
i'm a little shocked that this so called health food product is made from chinese grown ingredients i 'd be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is also keep in mind that chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products all the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the united states why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price \? your purchasing choice does make a difference let 's stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy they never will we can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well being make purchase decisions wisely . 
mrs may 's should inform their customers where exactly their products are made and take a stand i wo n't be buying any more of her products until further notice no matter how yummy they are do no harm and quality control is a concept not understood in china totally frightening what they 're getting away with . 
i used to like this product until i learned that it is made in china ! br br how many more horror stories do we need to hear about such atrocities as lead in baby toys made in china , contaminated baby formula made in china , contaminated tooth paste made in china , and poisoned pet food before we learn that if it comes from china it should not go in your mouth , your baby 's mouth , or your pet 's mouth \? \? ! ! ! . 
i used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips these taste very crunchy and tasty br br given the kind of unethical food stories we read about china we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these you just cannot import food stuff and sell in the us as gourmet snack food there needs to be data backing this br br few example of chinese food \( yuk \) br br \( 1 \) melamine \( kind of platic \) in baby food and milk \( so wide spread that 80 of milk in china contained this plastic in 2008 \) br br \( 2 \) honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin \( antibiotic \) because of which it was banned in the us br br \( 3 \) soy sauce made from human hair \( not joking google it if you want \) br br \( 4 \) spurious drugs exported to african countries br br need some good facts and quality controls from the manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls . 
not real crazy but this product they did not taste good but looked real cute in the little booties i made for the baby shower tables . 
i thought it was okay but not harbanero bbq sauce from hell i would probally not get it again also it was not worth the money i thought it was kind of a ripoff it was 10 for barbque sauce you could have made at home . 
i expected the flavor to be more like that of brewed green tea it really does taste like dried green tea leaves simply dissolved in water although i'm sure this is probably a good way to get a concentrated amount of antioxidants , i would n't order this again . 
this tea is not so tasty in my opinion but one thing about opinions is that every one has one and we do not always agree . 
as others have said , this is really mild in flavor ! the instructions call for 1 packet per 16 oz of water there are 6 packets per box br br i decided to give it a try as i am basically lazy and wanted some \( unsweetened unlemoned \) iced tea that i could make on a moment 's whim br br i started with 1 packet per 16 oz of water then 2 packets per 16 oz of water and got some flavor now i'm using 3 packets per 16 oz of water \( i placed a fairly large order so i could experiment with it and have it throughout the fall and winter \) br br since i'm using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor , i will probably not order this item again . 
i have been drinking green tea powder for a few years and have come to love the slightly bitter and tannic flavor of it i decided to try the stash brand instead of my normal japanese brand , and it 's not even in the same universe the stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all seriously , the stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it real , authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100 tea , with no additives ! br br if you drink a lot of green tea , you will be very disappointed with the stash product i strongly recommend you go with a japanese brand that contains 100 tea only br br i tried to return it to amazon , but they do n't allow grocery items to be returned ! . 
what can i say , i love iced tea i drink a lot of it , and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets i am also a big fan of stash products , or rather of all the other stash products i have tried br i purchased a case of all 4 varieties , \( when i say i drink iced tea , i am not kidding \) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle br i finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first \( if not the tea clumped on me \) , and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable br unfortunately by doing that to this flavor , the ginger was out of control , and not in a good ginger tea sort of way br over all i am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market . 
i was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after i realized that the lipton brands all contained sucralose , and did not come in an unsweetened version i found stash tea online and decided to try it , using stevia as the sweetener i bought the lemon ginger flavor br br by comparison , i think the lipton powdered iced tea i had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity kool aid for adults this is different i am having to get used to the green tea taste , and it upset my stomach a little \( when i drink hot tea , i usually drink white tea , because i like the mild taste \) br br i tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better i would probably like white tea better , but stash does n't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix anyway i hope to get used to the taste since right now i like it watered down , it 's really a good deal as far as price .

i wanted desperately to love , or even like this drink mix , but am not having success doing so i love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me it 's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it every once in a while i 'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping i change my taste it 's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people . 
when i received the package just earlier today i was excited to try it out immediately i'm already a loyal drinker of the yamamotoyama iced green tea powder and wanted to give stash a try , particularly the mint flavor \( yamamotoyama only has three flavors original unsweetened , sweetened and raspberry \) when i checked the ingredients of this product \( ground sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor \) i already expected that this would be unsweetened \( after all , mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said natural , i expected it unsweetened \) br br i do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle , however i could sense a bit of the mint maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content , you 'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong mint flavor br br but the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it \( well in this case it has natural peppermint in it \) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats , such as smoothies and even desserts just the other day i even added the yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my muesli hot cereal and it was delicious i plan to do the same with this stash mint green tea powder \( i'm an experimenting foodie so does n't hurt to try lol \) with my hot cereal and milk br br you can even substitute milk instead of water ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from starbucks and jamba juice before \? try it with this one \) . 
i wasted a little over 15 00 because the reviews were so good br this has no taste cold or hot it states to use 16oz of cold water br well , i used just a cup and it did n't work out for me br i tried adding more packets and it helped but very little br i am an avid tea and coffee drinker and can only resolve br that the other reviewers have never had a good strong cup br of green tea , or i am missing something here br i do not recommend this tea . 
what can i say , i love iced tea i drink a lot of it , and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets i am also a big fan of stash products , or rather of all the other stash products i have tried br i purchased a case of all 4 varieties , \( when i say i drink iced tea , i am not kidding \) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle br i finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first \( if not the tea clumped on me \) , and than add the rest of the water just to make these palatable and only than were these passable br over all i am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market .

this tea is the most awful stuff i 've ever put in my mouth it has a chemical taste i tried adding sugar and it did n't help i enjoy the arizona pomegranate gree tea and would highly recomment it . 
this tea has an awfully light flavor i use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes very tasty i generally shake 12 ounces cold milk , 2 3 packets of this tea powder , and 1 ounce simple syrup , then pour it over ice tho make the frappe , i blend the same ingredients with ice , instead of pouring it over ice it is annoying that to make a small drink i need to use 2 3 times more than expected . 
i 've had quite a few sencha powders in my time the stash product is one of the best priced products out there br br that said , what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water i can barely taste the tea , and i'm pretty sensitive to tea flavors if you get this product , keep your mixes at 8 oz of water otherwise , it 's like you 're drinking a flavorless algae br br otherwise , it 's a good product at a good price at proper concentrations , the flavor is good , and you ca n't beat the health benefits of a good sencha green tea . 
the tea was very weak and not that good now i have six boxes of tea i that no one in my family likes . 
this iced tea is terrible this is the first stash product that i do not enjoy it is not iced tea it tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves . 
the first ingredient in this mix , before the tea is even listed is maltodextrin if you suffer from a corn allergy , please do not forget to read the label unwittingly drink this i have no idea why there is more maltodextrin in this product than the main product , the tea itself i realize this is not a review , let alone a helpful review , as i did not describe the taste of the product or even review the product i could n't review this product , if i wanted too i want people with a corn allergy to be advised of the ingredients in the tea i did n't know how else to inform folks about the ingredients except for on the page with reviews i could not give the product more stars , as it contains more maltodextrin , than tea itself . 
i bought this tea as i like blueberries , and stash is known as making good teas however , when i first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green \( not very appetizing \) once i mixed the powder with water , the resulting tea had no real flavor i feel like i wasted my money and ca n't get a refund . 
i bought this flavor and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent , it 's useless br br if you plan on making a pitcher of tea , forget it , it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very , very weak in flavor , and it must be consumed in 12 hours \( so they say \) so you 're much better off brewing your own br br however , if you 're idea is to stash this in your purse \( for the ladies \) or pocket \( for men , which would be weird \) it 's still misses the mark one packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you 'd have to use two , and who drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature \? also , with only 8 to 12 packets in a box \( depends on flavor , who knows why \? \) , that gives you 4 to 6 , 16 oz drinks for 3 not sure it 's worth it at all , i 'd rather drink lemon water when out than this .

this was a big disappointment there was no raspberry or pomegranate flavor to this the color is green and not very appealing to look at however it does work as a great antioxidant . 
i wish i had read the product description better i didn t realize this was sweetened i do not like the sweetened teas now i am stuck with 2 orders of them but the other green tea powder is great . 
when i saw the mint iced tea powder on the website , i thought i would like it but when i received it and tried one , i was very disappointed it was the green tea and not sweet at all the flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like i was expecting i had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that i like to be similar to regular iced tea i do n't even know if i 'll be using the others i had received sorry about this , but you did ask for my review on this . 
upon opening the sealed bag , i was struck by an unpleasant scent looking at the ingredients i saw , in addition to the black tea and rosebuds , a natural flavor additive i believe this additive is the culprit to ruining what should have been a delightful bouquet to my nose then i brewed this tea , and could still taste that additive , but overall the tea was tasty i hope the davidson family reads our reviews because i am certain that , if they would just refrain from adding the natural flavor , i and others would find this tea to be superb , and in keeping with the other teas i have come to enjoy from davidson 's for example , upon opening their darjeeling loose tea , as well as their assam loose tea , my nose is struck with a lovely bouquet this is what one wants to experience from superb teas i will look forward to davidson 's responding to my \( and other customer 's \) suggestion re this nasty flavor additive i 've enjoyed tea with rose petals while in india , and they did not put anything other than the tea and the dried rose petals . 
this tea was horrible it tasted like potpourri i have really enjoyed other davidson 's teas , many also containing flowers , and thought to try something new i think the last ingredient is where things went bad it was natural flavor which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all . 
when i ordered this tea , i was so excited because i thought i had finally found the equal to another brand 's rose tea \( in individual bags \) i was excited for the loose quality of the tea , along with the anticipated light delicate taste i 'd hoped for br i was sadly mistaken when i excitedly opened it , i was hit by a very sweet , syrupy , cotton candy like smell coming from the bag not a good scent then , i thought 'the smell does n't determine the taste' so i steeped the recommended tablespoons for the amount of time indicated and then tried a taste the overpowering sweet smell gave was to a bitter taste , not at all reminiscent of my previous experience with rose tea unfortunately , i had to pour the rest of mine out br i have a bag of hibiscus tea coming in the mail soon from this company i'm really hoping it 's better ! . 
i wanted to love this but i just did n't despite being sugar free it has 15 calories per pump and in my opinion needs three pumps to add enough flavor to my iced vanilla lattes if your going for calorie count this is n't favorable i would however say if you think other brands are a bit too sweet or if calorie count is n't overly important you should give it a go , it may be just what you were looking for ! as a side note if calorie count is unimportant i recommend their coconut cream flavor a href http www amazon com gp product b005zu3jj4 amoretti premium coconut cream syrup \( 750ml \) a , its delicious ! . 
we purchased from the original website 8 flavored sugars all but the raspberry was worth the money the rest had little or no flavor at all ! it was expensive and not worth the money . 
i love the popcorn , but the shipping costs are insane ! ! a total rip off wabash valley farms or amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind 5 stars for the popcorn minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping argh yes , the popcorn is tender and luscious , and it melts in your mouth like you 're eating cooked grasshoppers , but come on ! ! ! ca n't you ship this product for less \? br br shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse sigh too bad really . 
i purchased the baby white by accident we usually get the medium white , which is great the baby is so small when popped that the taste and texture of the hull shell really overwhelm it . 
tasty , small kernel popcorn however , too small and too light to be popped in a hot air popcorn popper the kernels are blown out of the popper before they are popped . 
the gourmet corn is smaller kernels than i like so would probably not buy it again but with their special oil and the stir crazy popper every kernel pops every time br br i will probably return to good old jolly time . 
i was disappointed i thought being amish and according to the advertising that it would be exceptional but it 's just popcorn , no better than others i 've purchased so , so i would not buy it again . 
wish i would have read the reviews that discuss the product 's performance in hot air poppers the pc is very tasty and light with no residual kernel shells that get stuck in your teeth 4 stars br br problem with using it in hot air poppers is that the kernels are too light and fly out of the machine before they pop tilting the machine helps keep them inside , but it would be simpler just to find another larger kernel corn . 
popcorn has grear color \( white \) but taste is average and due to shipping costing more then product , i would not buy again . 
this is terrible popcorn ! no taste , poor popping ratio and the size omg ! i popped this gourmet popping corn in front of a party , everyone busted out in laughter ! . 
do not spend your money on this product as you will find the popping ratio extremely poor one cup of popcorn will have 1 2 cup of un poped \( old mades \) kernels left over which is unacceptable this is a non returnable item so if you buy this one you are just out of luck , so i recommend staying away from this one . 
this is my first time trying wabash valley farms amish country baby white br br pros it 's okay with a nice mild nutty flavor the hulls are more pronounced than with some other amish baby white br br cons it tends not to briskly pop up in fact , we 've burned several pans because popping it is tricky we found that the microwave often works better than pan popping and as mentioned above , the hulls are much more noticeable than with other amish baby white brands br br we purchased these 6 bags and we 'll use them up but wo n't be ordering any more next time we 'll drive the long distance to our nearest amish store . 
if you like your popped corn small this is for you taste is good and it is crisp yet tender the only real complaint is it has a disproportional amount of hull . 
bought 6lbs of this popcorn based on reviews that the hulls are softer on this baby white than on regular popcorn not only are the hulls just as tough as regular popcorn , the corn pops up so tiny that it 's about 1 3 hull , 2 3 popped corn per kernel ! i was hoping to use this as a healthy snack for my kids who love popcorn but not the hulls br i popped this using every tip i could find on the internet all experiments still resulted in a tough hull . 
received the baby yellow instead of the correct baby white kernels unable to return the product since it 's a grocery item , but amazon com customer service did an excellent job and provided a full refund as far as can tell , no other issues with product . 
i am so surprised that they have this popcorn for sale i received 6 bags the other day and the special popcorn pan from wabash valley farms amish country gourmet well the popped kernels are the size of a pea and with hulls it burns very easily there are too many old maids due to the delicate nature of the kernel i ended up throwing most of the popped corn away i am so disappointed in this product i now have 5 75 bags of this stuff i have nothing good to say about it but if you like tiny popped corn with lots of hulls then this may be your product i am giving mine to the squirrels . 
the baby white popcorn has lots of hulls when popped , very small kernels and scorched the bottom of my new whirley popper i 've had several poppers and this is the first time one has scorched and the first time i 've used the wabash corn shipping charges were very high for a relatively inexpensive corn . 
this popcorn has alot of hulls i order 4 bags and ca n't stand to eat it it 's so hully terrible . 
the popcorn was delivered as promised in an attractive wrapper i used the whirley pop popcorn maker and used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and popped it according to the instructions of the whirley popper while the majority of the kernels popped , there was also a large amount of 'seeds' or residue that can get caught in your teeth and are somewhat distracting while you 're eating i actually got better results using orville redenbacher white popcorn kernels in the whirley popper \( and it was actually cheaper at the local market \) overall i give amish country 3 out of 5 stars and mostly for the presentation of the package than for the yield results . 
i ordered this because amazon recommended it to go along with the redenbacker popcorn popper i got from them hey , only a few of these actually pop ! most of these small , unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper what an absolute waste of money ! . 
this is good popcorn , but it is very small so you need to make twice as much as you normally would . 
worst popcorn ive ever bought chewy not fluffy gave it to the birds for bird food postage was outrageous ! just not a good experience all around wont be buying from them ever again . 
this baby white popcorn pops small and somewhat hard i have tried several batches with various adjustments of heat , using a whirlypop popcorn popper unsatisfactory results ! i wo n't purchase this again . 
we loved this popcorn but come on shipping is way over the top we would settle next time for something we can buy but not spend 3 times on shipping . 
i can only go as low as 1 star on the review , though i 'd like to rate it a 0 this item still shows in stock , but clearly is n't , which is why my order was canceled from amazon today amazon suggested i search out the item again , and in doing so i see that this same vendor states the item is available not so br br technically this review does not relate to the quality of the product , just the ability to be able to ship it good luck ! . 
i 've just prepared my first can of this soup it tasted incredibly bland , and did n't have much clam flavor so then i added more milk , butter , onions , salt and fresh ground pepper , plus white wine for 2 92 per 15 oz can , all of those ingredients should have been adequately added in there already , except for the pepper bar harbor brand certainly did n't stint on the other ingredients in order to increase the amount of clams , that 's for sure there were larger pieces of clams than in progresso 's but that 's damning with faint praise next time i 'll buy the clams and make my own , for less , probably i'm just perplexed by these reviews i think i can safely say progresso 's tastes better and , of course , it 's much less expensive . 
i'm a little perplexed by all the great reviews this was the most bland chowder i 've ever had i prepared it with just milk and a little butter , and it tasted like nothing ! added some salt and white pepper , still nothing added some black pepper and provence herbs , now it tastes like herbed potato soup br br on the plus side the clams were nice big chunks and the potatoes were tender the consistency was pretty good too it just had no flavor not going to be buying this again , certainly not when it 's this expensive , too . 
i 've had better canned clam chowder bookbinders is one that comes to mind i do n't buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients , so my choice is limited for this one , if i add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter , along with some extra sea salt , it 's ok the longer it is gently heated not simmered or boiled to let the flavors mingle , the better it becomes more clams and potatoes would improve it as it is , the ingredients were skimpy . 
bits of clam \? \( not sure \) in water with something i assume is potatoes whose recipe is this \? save your money get something worth having how do so many like this \? ! it 's awful ! if you prefer real clam chowder and not seawater with something floating in it do not buy this ! . 
my local store had the product lineon close out at 77 cents a can so i bought a dozen cans of different verities lobster soup was very fishy for starters and the manhattan chowder was very watered down the new england chowder is somehow creamy and void of flavor the clam corn chowder was not enjoyable br br i am real soup eater and take soup at least once a day and always when i dine out long story short this is the most tasteless soup and just not good i suggest you pass on this and i am sure cambells will be a much better choice than these soups sorry , i had leave an unfavorable review bit this soup is just not worth eating and 77 cents a can i would never buy this again . 
i expected better from a premium maine chowder this is no better than , say , snow 's , which you can get for less than half the price not bad , but not worth the money . 
we opened a can of bar harbor clam chowder and could not believe how few clams were in the chowder there were mostly potatoes . 
tried this yesterday as a treat on a cold , rainy fall night it had an unpleasant , grainy and somewhat watery texture the clams were actually sandy and gritty and the potatoes were kind of chalky , for lack of a better term the flavor was also very lacking it did n't really taste like , well , anything definitely not worth the price i can only imagine the people who wrote the good reviews either work for bar harbor or have never tried any other kind of clam chowder . 
we had high expectations for this product but the chowder was only average warming instructions are vague as to the amount of milk and or butter to blend in with the soup mix we found the flavor to be bland and one dimensional , even with as little as 1 2 cup of added whole milk br br the package of six cans contained three dented cans two of them were severely dinged on the seamlines and had to be tossed for this reason , we will no longer purchase can goods through the mail . 
i just finished my first bowl of this clam chowder , and was disappointed to find , or rather , not find , clams do n't get me wrong the soup was good , with a very nice texture and taste , but the clams were awol several times i bit into something that provided a small burst of clam flavor , but only once did i find a clam fragment big enough to look at i'm going to buy some chopped clams to kind of chum a bit this , of course increases the cost of the meal i'm going to try some other brands as well br br i do hope that bar harbor does some testing the label shows clams as the most prevalent ingredient , but i do n't see how that can be my money is on the potatos . 
but still not that great it 's bland even when i added salt , pepper , milk , and butter , it did n't taste like the best i 've had but at least it 's edible , unlike every other canned clam chowder out there if i can find a way to make this taste better than i 'd love it it 's the best canned clam chowder i 've ever had , but it 's not that great the clams taste good br br edit i had a 2nd can and i made it today , i added only a little bit of milk and i added no salt , pepper , or butter , and it actually tastes a lot better than when i did so i suggest adding nothing but some milk or cream to this soup it 's still not the best i 've ever had though . 
i was really excited to try clam chowder from maine but it did not wow me i think campbell 's might even be better . 
one perfect box no rips , tears or gouges inside the box \? 6 badly dented cans of chowder that looked like they fell out of an airplane every single can ! very disappointed should i return them all \? is the chowder any good \? was this a joke \? i rate this 1 star for the unblemished box . 
when i first started to use iams savory sauce , my dogs loved it after a few weeks , they do n't seem to care too much for it anymore they still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while , and will eventually eat it when they are hungry , but they do n't consider it to be a treat anymore i still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced , and low calorie one big negative i have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it they are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around the mouth stains i used to buy all different flavors of iams savory sauce , buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining vitagravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins , so if your must have some sort of gravy , i recommend vitagravy a bit more or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog this creates a gravy like texture and aroma that most dogs love not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues , but a great free solution for picky eaters . 
our dog loves this stuff i bought it for a occasional treat since he only eats dry dog food , i thought it would be a nice treat for him to have a lil something extra every now and then but this stuff stinks really bad like dirt , it makes the whole area where the dog eats smell like we just opened and bag of soil in the house if they could improve the smell of it , that would be awesome , because our dog just loves it but we ca n't bare the smell of it . 
i ordered this pack of 20 1 pound full leaf tea which looked like a great deal well br br 1st , it 's not 20lbs of tea , i received only 1 br br 2nd , it 's not high quality full leaf tea , but rather the ground tea leaves you 'd expect from lipton br br strangely enough , i ordered the non decaf regular version and it arrived as full leaf tea and does n't taste half bad if someone receives something different than i or rather if someone receives what was advertised , i 'd like to know about it maybe i 'll try again . 
this was the 2nd time that i ordered the smokehouse usa chicken stix the 1st order had usa printed right on the bag , this one had a usa sticker over the china sticker in addition , the product looked entirely different obviously i am concerned i pay more to ensure i am not feeding my fur kids products from china if it happens again , i 'll stop ordering all smokehouse products on line . 
with the prime shipping , this made a great last minute gift it seems a little pricey for the amount of fish , but the quality was good \( according to the person i gave it to \) in the end , i think this is better than a fruit basket or something similar . 
i think pack of 4 for 25 00 is too much \( 6 25 per box \) i got them in target for less than 3 00 sometimes also , maybe because of promotion , i got them for 2 80 or around that at safeway i will not buy this one online taste is five stars , but price is one star . 
i subscribe to this monthly but just got an email stating that it 's changing from 17 oz to 16 9 oz but no price change \? wow that 's a really lame cut to increase their profit margins whatever i wo n't miss the 1 oz obviously but how about messaging and acknowledging your devoted consumers . 
this product does n't have the greatest taste i like jamba coconut water , but it 's hard product to find i purchased this to try out and i'm not liking it , but it 's tolerable when it 's cold really cold \( reason why i gave it two stars \) i tried the coconut water when it was warm to see if it really tastes bad like some of the reviews said and sure enough , they were right . 
according to an article on cnn com on 8 5 11 , the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the lable br researchers at consumerlab com tested the sodium , potassium , magnesium , and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water , and they found that only one , zico natural , contained the stated amount for all four ingredients br br the sugar and potassium content in the other two brands , vita coco and o n e , also matched the label but the amounts of sodium and magnesium two nutrients key to hydration were as much as 82 and 35 lower , respectively , than the listed amount . 
i bought this at a local gas station near my house and was excited to try it because i see it everywhere it was nasty i will never drink this crap again , i do n't care how good it is for you the taste is disgusting and i 'd rather just drink regular water blah ! . 
this stuff is pretty disgusting i do n't care if madonna , tom cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps , it tastes bad and as far as rehydrating better than water , umm , do n't think so it might replenish potassium , although , unless you are participating in the olympics , you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity . 
i had hoped that this would taste like pina coladas but it does n't it is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue i wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow the reason i gave it 2 stars is because it is good in mixed drinks i have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol if you are going to drink this straight , it helps if it is really cold almost frozen if you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing i can taste in it , . 
the product description says 12 packs of 12 \( 144 count \) , but when you order , you only get a box of twelve i did this weeks ago , talked to amazon , but they still have n't updated the product description . 
when i placed my order it was for hartz pigskin 10 pack with sweet potato center when i received the order it was hartz pigskin 10 packs but it was all pigskin and this is not easy for my dog to chew i contacted the company and they were very nice about the hole thing as they refunded the money to my credit card and told me to take the pigskin packs to a local shelter or spca they were also very fast in sending out the original product they told me that they forgot to change the photo from sweet potato center to all wrapped pigskin and they would do that . 
i emailed customer service and asked if the treats were filled with sweet potato , and they assured me that they 'd checked with the manufacturer and confirmed that they did in fact have a sweet potato center however , the ones i received did not and i feel like i was lied to by customer service because they did n't want to take the time to actually check into it . 
if you love super dark , rich , bold and thick flavored coffee then this is the coffee for you with one problem personally i love coffee that embodies everything i just said i love esspresso and the like to find a k cup that is this bold even on the 10 oz setting is great but there is that problem again br br it smells , tastes , and leaves the after taste of burnt urine ! like someone torched a public restroom and mopped the floor with coffee , then packaged it yum ! br br there are other dark , bold k cups out there that have a better smell , flavor and does not have a nasty after taste you may not believe me , and that is fine , but get a sample pack before going for the 24 , you 'll thank me later try the green mountain coffee extra bold sumatran reserve k cups better all around cup of coffee . 
it 's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out great marketing idea they taste okay to me a bit subtle on the chocolate ihmo mostly they 're lightly flavored , chocolate , wheat crackers they have very little nutritional value but over 39 sugar the 100 calories is achieved by a very light product it does n't weigh much so , 100 calories sounds great but only if you eat but one package not easy to do if you 're hungry still , it 's a convenient snack to put in a backpack , lunch box , carry on \( now that they do n't feed you much when you fly \) , etc with less calories than most alternatives could also tide you over between meals still , i 'd personally prefer something a bit healthier but that 's why there 's chocolate vanilla oops , they left out the vanilla ! . 
with any low fat or low calorie food , you 're going to sacrifice taste of portion size with this product , you sacrifice both br br it 's a good idea , which was done well with the oreos and others in this series of 100 calorie snacks , but i think you 're better off with a single cookie from the regular chips ahoy box than a whole bag of these . 
i was sorely disappointed in these cookies they are pretty tasteless and damn hard too i would n't buy them again and i 've certainly tasted much better low cal cookies i definitely recommend saving your money , folks . 
chips ahoy cookies were not very tasty my children and husband would not eat them i tried to give them away and everyone refused . 
sorry , but i was n't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers okay , i admit that i never liked oreos that much in the first place this 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like oreos , for sure minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling but as one other reviewer noted , they 're not all that chocolaty , a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic worse than that , they 're not so good for you if you 're going to have 100 calories , there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar for my money , a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense it not only costs less , it 's got lots more nutritional value , not to mention fibre . 
these things are nothing like oreos you think wow oreos think again i would say spend your money on something better \( the hershey 's or reese 's crisp wafer bars come to mind \) my honest view on these thin crisps cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer , or milk bones . 
to be honest with you , i got these at a store you think wow chocolate chips , and oreos think again for those that think these are so good , i would recommend the hershey 's or reese 's crisp wafer bars my honest view on these thin crisps cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer , or milk bones . 
these things are low cal oreo 's minus the creme , minus the cookie ! the title oreo is basically a total misnomer these are nothing but black crackers with some sugar if that is what you want , then click purchase . 
well , when i bought this item i thought it would be a direct japan import it is taiwanese br it was bought at costco and resold \( the price label was still the product \) br br the product can be bought at costco for half the price if not less br br the expiration date was not printed on the product which makes me think it was expired br i believe this as most of the mochi is dry and tough br br will shy away from this product . 
this comes in a case of 24 so i bought one can locally before ordering the large amount good move ! i have 3 cats and none of them would eat it this review is for the mature gourmet beef entree have n't tried the other favors yet . 
i feed hills science diet to my pet because i love him and the vet tells me i should but in all honesty , this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap lock reseal that i have ever encountered it is painfully difficult to get it to close properly and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product br br packaging is important it is no better for your pet to live on stale , oxidized food than it would be for you oxidized fats are also called rancid if you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human well , you get the idea this is about more than just inconvenience br br i am posting this review for all the hills science diet products with this kind of packaging if you have had the same experience as me with this product , please take the time to let this company know about it br br i love my animal i want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him but this quite literally the worst reseal that i have ever had the misfortune to encounter br br theo . 
this review will make me sound really stupid , but whatever i do n't really care as long as people find out what 's real and can avoid my mistakes br br i got my wonderful little sweet bella bean when she was a few days shy of three years old she had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap i have had cats around me my entire life , for about twenty five years now my mother always just fed them whatever , the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket friskies , nine lives , kit kaboodle , stuff like that and our cats were always fine , at least in terms of their eating habits they would eat in the morning , stop when they were done , come back , and eat some more when they got hungry br br my housemate at the time was working for hill 's and assured me that this was the best food ever made , so great , so on and so forth i now know that she is an utter buffoon , but i initially trusted her judgment , which is so unfortunate because she does n't think she also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags , which made it a much more attractive choice br br i first tried feeding the little bean an unmeasured amount of science diet in a bowl , but that did n't work , as she would devour it in one sitting so then i took to measuring it , and she did the same thing then i started parsing it out to twice a day that did n't work either , because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day , running around , intentionally destroying things , deliberately spilling her water , crying , etc , until she got more food so then i split it into three servings same thing then it got to be four servings that was a little better , but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times so then it went back to three all the while , i was trying to reduce the amount of food i was feeding her to less than 3 4 of a cup because she was a little chubby reducing was hell she became even more hungry , but i figured she would get used to it not really br br for over a year , she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way , knocking things off my desk , ripping up any paper she could find , scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief as soon as she got food , she was back to her sweet self , but only for three or four hours br br we thought she was bored , we thought she was a little nutty , and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder she always wanted food it was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad br br a few weeks back , we took her to a new \( good , non money factory \) vet for her second checkup since i 've had her i talked with him about her being always hungry he asked what she ate , and i told him the adult indoor science diet without saying as much , he basically told me that this food is garbage and i should look for something else he said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients science diet does , in a very loose , by product kind of way ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it healthy , instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning not that i care about spending money on the bean , but this food is way too expensive for what it is br br so we began transitioning her onto wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago she is still eating 50 percent science diet with 50 percent wellness \( you really should n't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue \) but she never freaks out anymore it 's amazing and it 's 100 percent because she is eating real food now , along with that sawdust and chicken hearts i still regrettable have to feed her we have her down to eating twice a day , only 1 3 cup in total she was eating three times a day , 5 8 of a cup in total now she eats some in the morning , walks away , eats some more a few hours later , and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding no more knocking things over , no more trashing dad 's papers on the desk , no more howling , no more deliberately spilled water on the floor it 's incredible br br i feel so bad that i was doing this to her for so long we really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever but no , she was genuinely hungry because she was n't eating any real food br br do your cat a favor buy her or him so food made with real ingredients , things you would eat wellness , halo , innova , evo , whatever figure it out for yourself , but please do n't feed your cat this it 's garbage .

although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced the cans say it is minced but it is n't , it is ground beef my cat only likes minced not chunks , not ground although she will eat ground cat food sometimes , it has to be inviting and delicious , yet she just walks away from this br br i hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product the shipping was speedy and the value is great \( as long as they deliver what the promise \) now i am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all . 
i ordered this because it is science diet and it says it is minced well , it is not minced and my cats do not like it it is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they ca n't eat it i am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too will not be buying it again returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so i would be losing money .

i made the mistake of believing that science diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use after doing some research i realized that science diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or iams \( i would not recommend any of these options \) br br the main ingredients are chicken by product and corn here are some interesting facts cat 's ca n't digest corn in fact , they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition when i fed my cat the science diet he ate all the time , constantly after switching him over to castor and pollux indoor cat formula he eats much less now br br also , by product means just that beaks , feathers , toe nail clippings , meat not suitable for human consumption , dead animals , etc totally not worth the it 's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself \( does n't sound so appealing does it \? \? \) science diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find do n't let your vet fool you either vets usually get a 40 cut from hill 's to sell you their cat food br br my recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research try brands like newmans own or castor and pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record br br i later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals science diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers a requirement is to exclusively feed science diet to the animals br br try this instead a href http www amazon com gp product b001bcubz0 castor pollux ultramix indoor feline fomula dry cat food , 15 pound bag a . 
this food is working well for my 19 1 2 year old cat with kidney problems but i ca n't find any info on how many cans are included for this price \? i'm guessing 24 cans based on shipping weight and the price , but i wo n't buy without better info . 
sent this as a gift , and found out later that many items were stale they loved the thought , though , and loved the way it looked . 
i did not know anything about chutney until i went on a known recipe cite and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar ! i thought chutney was a different form of marmalade but i was wrong ! . 
i received this box with great anticipation since they do n't sell these on the west coast i got the package , opened the box and was extremely disappointed the cookies looked like a gorilla shook the box to death and left most of the box filled with crumbs and there was a rodent sized hole on the side of the box ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! so , needless to say i will not not be reordering these again . 
the shipping was very fast , but so was the expiration date got it on feb 14 , 2012 expiration is april 4 , 2012 \( only 6 weeks before it expires \) who can eat so much seaweed in such a short time \? \? \? \? \? \? i should have returned it , but who wants to go through all the trouble well i stuffed it all in the freezer and hope it will be still eatable that 's what you get when you order food online i will not order it again ! ! ! ! . 
i was disappointed when i received this shipment , as the seaweed contains msg , and it 's not listed as an ingredient br amazon was very gracious and refunded me the amount of purchase . 
my local walmart and target both have this , ground or whole bean , at a regular price of less than 9 per 12 oz bag it 's way overpriced here br br it is an excellent coffee i'm drinking it as i write this an interesting hint of woody , creamy , citrusy taste that 's dark but without the burnt aftertaste that comes with many dark roasts . 
i ordered this thinking it would be a yellow cake mix it is a heavy cake and is brown that said , it comes in handy to make streusel coffee cake , upside down cake and other augmented recipes because it is a basic mix and in those recipes the heaviness is n't a problem plain cake though was disappointing so get creative instead . 
i made cupcakes with the vanilla cake mix they were just ok they were dense , but not overly so so that was n't too bad the flavor , however , is where i was disappointed the vanilla flavor was so subtle that i missed it entirely , and i felt like there needed to be a little more sweetness \( which probably would have also made them a bit more moist \) the child i made them for only ate a few bites . 
i tried vanilla cake mix and pizza crust mix and was disappoined in both they had a medicinal bitter taste and even smelled strange i threw both items away . 
the chocolate cake is fantastic , so i had reason to think that this would be as well not the case it was very dense tasteless totally unlike the airy , tasty chocolate br i want my money back or an even exchange for the chocolate cake mix . 
i was expecting these cookies were going to be normal size but i was wrong ! i was planning on dipping them in chocolates but they r not those average size at all ! so disappointed ! i now have to go out n find the normal size cookies what a waste of money i also needed 50 but 20 of them were broken they do not put fragile on the box outside . 
reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes , i served them with a chinese christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed , as were my guests three sample fortunes are life is not a struggle it 's a wiggle management is doing things right leadership is doing the right things if you 're feeling down , try throwing yourself into your work these are not fortunes , they are self help mini bites a fortune is your love of travel will soon be satisfied , and it does n't matter if they are predictive or not what matters is that they state a fortune beware the dog in the corner house , would be fun to get life is a wiggle is boring br the cookies arrived on schedule , as promised , and in good condition in their individual wrappers all of that was as i 'd hoped but content counts , in fortune cookies especially . 
this tastes just like wint o green life savers it 's a hard , sweet , crunchy ring , with a minty flavor that pretty much describes it it 's a crunchy mint shaped like a ring . 
this is good popcorn , i have purchased before in hawaii i was happy to see that i can order online however , i purchase the 20 pack and they overstuffed the box there is no bubble wrap or any type of wrapping around the individual packages before they put it into the box they choose a small box that can barely fix all twenty packages it is overstuffed to the point that the box is no longer squared , but rounded somewhat the postal service does not treat the package with care , so when it arrived , there was a wet stain when we opened it , two packages had been damaged , and the butter leaked all over all the other packages we had to spend a long time washing all the packages , because they are all greasy the greasiness does not wash off easily even with soap now when eating them , some of the other packages of popcorn got water in them because of the washing , they are not air tight packages so when popping them , there are a lot of unpopped kernels they should use bigger boxes and wrap it better . 
if you want the best wild rice , buy the regular kind this quick cook type is not near the taste quality of the regular 40 minute cook time rice , . 
although i think this pen is great i did n't receive the entire roll of polytape even after calling customer service and i think the height of the posts is misleading hence the 3 stars if i wanted to buy a new energizer and more polytape then it would be great to own , as my review below states br br easy one page instructions and everything fits nicely back inside the bag , without struggling br br i needed this portable paddock for my goats because i have a lot of unfenced acreage beyond the barn area i was worried about the fence being suitable for goats so i called customer service the rep went to a lot of trouble and checked this for me and said it would work fine for goats as well however , several days later , i called back and spoke to another rep and he said that goats needed much higher voltage this particular energizer is 3 , 000 volts and that goats needed 5 , 000 to 8 , 000 volts but he said i could just buy another pulse type energizer and it would work with the tape that i have i have older , very mellow goats so the 3 , 000 volts are working so far br br i have different breeds and therefore different heights of goats and one concern was that the clips on the post would n't be low enough to the ground for my mixed breed goats but on the post , it has clips all the way down so that the tape can be hung at various heights however , even though the post is listed as 4ft high , i measured and they are actually 47 1 8 inches tall and after you push the metal tip into the ground , you are left with a height of 38 inches the tape rests at the bottom of the top clip which holds the tape at 35 inches off the ground seems awfully short for horses but i do n't know anything about horses either br br the instructions are clear and has helpful diagrams , making it all very easy to put together i did have problems at the end tying it to the last post i had to call customer service , and the rep said that you cannot unroll the whole spool of polytape if you are hanging it to the last post via the spool , which is per the instructions since i had already unrolled it to the end , i had to tie the end of the polytape to the post or to the empty spool container , which he said was okay , but then it 's not easy to untie that knot br br in lieu of posts , you can hang the guy wire around trees and then slide the electric tape through the loop guy wires , which are similar to tent stakes give the posts extra stability , but i saw no need for them at all since the clay soil held the posts very well br br my ground is hard clay but the fence posts sunk in easily , despite that it had rained within the last week though so it may be different depending on the dryness of the soil the posts are sturdy , and strong enough to not break with normal use i did have gravel in some spots which made me have to relocate a few posts , since the tips would not go past them br br there is no mention of the tape being allowed to touch weeds and grass , so i called customer service back to find that out he said that that only a low impedance energizer can be used near grass and this energizer is not low impedance so , i had to mow where i wanted to put the fence to avoid any problems with grounding not very practical when out on the road br br planning the fence was harder than i imagined because i could n't make a perfect square and i thought i had measured correctly but still fell short of where i wanted the fence to end i then discovered that i was only given 126 feet of polytape rather than the 200 feet doing a trial run of setting the fence up is recommended br br i wanted something that was easy i'm a small middle aged female and needed something that was n't too much trouble so i could move it around without a lot of sweat and tears this is perfect for my goat situation if they had just sent me the correct length tape it seems too short for horses but i posted the measurements in case it helped someone who has horses . 
i love these cookies , they taste exactly like oreos but unfortunately , every time i eat them \( 2 cookies at a time \) i get horrible headaches and migraines \( which i do n't get from real oreos \) its obviously caused by some of the 'nutritious' ingredients another thumbs down they include vitamin k which should not be eaten by anyone on blood thinners , or for anyone middle aged or older who overindulges in these cookies be warned vitamin k can cause blood clots br headache migraine sufferers beware of these cookies ! . 
i really liked these cookies when they first came out but then i got a little tired of them they have a bit of a gritty texture , and they do n't taste the way you hope they will when thinking of an oreo they are worth eating if you have a bad craving , but i ca n't eat more than one or two the different taste gets to me there may be an ingredient in them that does n't agree with me they contain vegetable oils , just like oreos do palm oil is in practically everything these days because it is cheap for companies to use when i eat it , it leaves a thick , greasy film in my mouth and throat store made cake frostings , cookies , cupcakes anything that has it leaves that feeling , and i do n't like it at all some are worse than others , making it hard to swallow this happened when i ate a double stuf chocolate whonu cookie palm oil is listed as an ingredient i stopped buying them and the regular chocolate i only get the vanilla version they contain palm oil as well , but i'm guessing it is less because they do n't bother me i like them much better it 's weird because i like chocolate sandwich cookies better than vanilla ones in general but with whonu , the vanilla wins for me br br yesterday i had a craving for a chocolate sandwich cookie , and i bought oreos even oreos do n't taste as good as they used to i guess since the trans fat change in products the whonu cookies have the extra vitamins and nutrients , and less sodium but the oreos have a better flavor the difference in fat content does n't seem to be very different actually , the difference in sodium does n't seem very significant , either i decided i 'd rather eat a few oreos than a few of these it 's something you have to decide for yourself when comparing the pros and cons . 
we purchased this product and were greatly disappointed the product did not have the texture or the taste that it should have we contacted customer service and when they discovered that we were complaining , they suddenly could not understand us and said customer service would contact us we never got a call back and could not get in touch with them again very expensive and no quality stay away from this company we lived in spain for years and know what this product should taste like and this was not what it should have tasted like . 
i was really looking forward to the dulce de leche cheerios the honey nut flavor has been my favorite since they came out and the thought of caramel was quite appealing br br the first few spoonfuls seemed quite yummy but the more i ate , the less i enjoyed it the caramel flavor seemed a bit off to me or maybe it was that these are more corn than oat so the flavor was different from that as well \( oats are the third ingredient after corn and sugar i thought cheerios were always oat cereals \) all things considered \( especially price \) , i 'll stick with honey nut br br they tasted pretty good just plain from the box so i think i 'll save them for when i want a slightly sweet snack but not too sugary i 'll pour out a handful and eat them like a toddler ! br br i expected these to be more sugary than the honey nut but these have 6 grams of sugar per serving compared to 9 grams for the honey nut but they have the same total carbohydrates , 22 grams per serving , so there is n't much difference in how it affects your body br br bottom line i wo n't buy them again . 
i 've had many types of pepper jelly , and this is by far the worst ever the price is high , and the taste is not good the shipping was outrageous more costly than the green pepper jelly do n't waste you money . 
these brownies bake up very nicely i would call their consistency cake like however my husband called them healthy brownies he said he could taste the flax seed i tend to agree in my opinion , if i'm going to eat chocolate , i do n't want it to have that healthy taste on the other hand i love the blueberry muffins that hodgson mill makes . 
i'm a big fan of hodgson mill products \( we love their bread mixes , i use their pancake mixes \) i'm not afraid of whole grains \( i mill my own grains , wheat , kamut , rye , barley \) and i even put milled flax seed in my \( home made \) yogurt i 've been a baker for 35 years and love to try new recipes br br i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth i can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the box br br one of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well br br i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch a little bit of time required a little less convenient but brownies being a treat \( and comfort food \) , the texture should be right \) . 
i like that this item has flax seed in it but the whole wheat flower makes it very grainy it is also very oily even after you cook it if you do not mind gritty brownies then get this product also , they are not very chocolately so i added chocolate chips to the recepie it makes it have more fat and calories but they taste better this way . 
i was hoping for a health substitute for white flour brownies it 's ok , but not what i would serve to company i substitute canola oil for the butter or margarine and that may have been the problem of course , i wound up eating them all anyway . 
first off , i love whole wheat products , and flax seed so i hope we just got a bad batch \( and no it was n't expired , i checked the date \) but my mom and i just had some of these and we 're not fans they had an oddly fishy grassy taste to it kind of like you might get with rancid flax oil tablets o o . 
i 've been buying these for nearly 5 years and this is the fiirst time that my son has refused to eat them they are darker green than usual , which was not a problem , but the texture was chewier and the flavor was n't as good this is a problem since it 's the only vegetable my son eats and he has severe feeding issues the taste texture were so different he was gagging not pleased with the change . 
i like the dried peas from just tomatoes and i also like their just corn they are way too expensive though they are really handy because i do n't use frozen or canned foods because i follow an ayurvedic diet which prohibits them when i can not find fresh peas i have to use these i will probably have to do without as i ca n't afford these , too bad . 
even though this item is listed under the gluten free category , it is not the ingredients state that it contains wheat protein do not order this if you need gf food bad reviewing by amazon ! . 
i struggle between giving this 3 or 4 , even 5 stars because i am just thankful for the substitute , as i have a condition that i need low acid coffee for however , i do have to admit , it tastes like burnt coffee \( as someone else put it \) and it is no peets or starbucks the taste , and the flavor it leaves in your mouth after you are done , is something i do n't think i will ever get used to br br update i had my father in law up would like to say that if you are one , like he is , that puts mounds of creamer and sugar in your coffee apparently you will not notice a difference in taste from this brand to another hope that helps ! . 
if you do n't want to give up the taste of coffee but ca n't handle the acid try this coffee does not taste like gourmet coffee but it does not produce acid side effects . 
i love , love , love dark roasted coffee and do n't like a acid taste so i thought this would be great , br br i was pleased with the 'no acid taste , but i had to use twice as much to get the same flavor i usually like that would n't be a big deal but it meant i went through the coffee faster than i should have and that can get expensive br br this blend was ground very finely so would not be good with a french press i was able to use it with a pour over . 
a short while ago , my doctor looked me in the eye and said , buddy , you got acid reflux real bad \( my dentist said the same only he was able to make his announcement a bit more colorful by showing `worst case scenario' pictures of teeth on battery acid he put me off coffee for a week \) so , with that double whammy in mind , i 've lately been trying to cut back on acidic foods hence my decision to go the low acid coffee route br br and like the headline says , this coffee is a good news bad news situation br br first , the good news puroast coffee does in fact appear to be legitimately low acid i 've noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking it br br now , the bad news this coffee is kinda bad i should note , this is n't the opinion of a coffee snob while i like a good cup of peet 's coffee as much as the next guy , i'm a okay with a batch of folger 's or the basic house brand of whatever chain store i happen to be shopping in i'm usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that is n't highway robbery br br alas , for all of its low acidity \( and decent price \) , this coffee ai n't that pleasant kick start there 's an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe other than to say that puroast does n't really taste like french roast coffee even doctored up with cinnamon and milk , the unpleasant flavor remains br br so yes , this coffee is effective , if you absolutely need to have coffee but if you 're looking for a pleasant , low acid kick start to your day , black tea might be a better , tastier option . 
i drink 10 cups a day of verona , italian , or french roast coffee , and wanted to try a lower acid version this brand of coffee smells and tastes like vinegar it is totally unpalatable and you are better off drinking water if the acid in coffee bothers you . 
this coffee tastes so nasty i ca n't even drink it it 's disgusting i ca n't believe anything this bitter is acid free i actually threw away two bags . 
flavor may be something that has to be given up with low acid coffee , but i decided i 'd rather take massive doses of pepcid and drink regular coffee than subject my tongue to this awful swill . 
this coffee smells really bad there is definitely no delicious smell as it brews or as you take sips from your mug it tastes just as awful too the first couple sips that i had , with my nose closed so i could n't smell it , was n't too bad but the more sips i took the more disgusting it was it is absolutely stomach turning \( to me at least \) and unfortunately i will never drink the whole bag it tastes like a weak , poorly brewed , cheap cup of coffee \( though not cheap ! \) the only positive note is that it did not irritate my bladder just irritated my nose and taste buds . 
i was a little disappointed i first made the muffins with it and then let the bread machine make and bake a loaf ok next i will try mixing it myself and baking in my oven i do have to keep in mind though that potato bread is dense and heavier than say white bread convenient is a plus . 
i have made potato bread before with great results but this hodgson bread mix is way too dry , it needs some more moisture do n't buy it unless you want really dry bread . 
howdy y'all , br br this bread is pretty good the potato flavor is there , recognizable as potato bread if you 've had it before and not overwhelming makes a good sandwich bread with meats or an enjoyably different pseudo bruschetta base br br made it with vegetable oil and olive oil as usual , the good olive oil makes for a somewhat better flavor br br rated a three cuz it 's just exactly as expected average with no surprises br br take care , br lee . 
white bread is not my thing , so that 's probably why i do n't like this one i like herby white breads and really full bodied white breads , but otherwise i always choose whole grains this one is not full bodied and has no particular flavor not interesting at all to me . 
i am a bit disappointed the flavor was not what i wanted or expected . 
as a former chef owner of a restaurant in my younger years , i was surprised and delighted at the exceptionally good taste and texture of the bookbinder 's white clam sauce wihtout doctoring it is a great product for easy convenience . 
three of us tried it one of us was barely able to drink it , with ice i guess this is , like evian , an acquired taste unless you 're able to try a single bottle before purchase , i recommend you pass . 
i have a recurring shipment of this product each month every month when the boxes arrive they are barely in one piece and very mangled last month one of the cases of water had to be repackaged before it arrived and it was a day late br br i suggest using a more sturdy box for shipping br br the water product is fine it 's just the shipping packaging i have a problem with . 
this water is pretty good , but not great at the time i got it , it was the most economical water that shipped free with prime , so if they keep that up , it will be a great deal for a lot of people br br i might be tainted , because i was just up in washington , where this water is from , and almost all of the bottled water i got up there , plus the tap water , was better than this but , i love washington water , so i'm probably judging it too harshly br br it 's not bad , and it does have a unique water taste , so i'm sure this will be someone 's absolute favorite water no one will hate this water br br pros br this is good water br has a unique taste br everyone will like it , but not a lot of people will ask for more br br cons br i expect more from washington water than this . 
i bought this water when i was at college for the first week i felt bad using my roommate 's water all the time and i was 7 states away from home so i ordered this water it was delicious , but the only complaint i have is that the bottles were really well plastic y i felt really un green drinking water out of these huge plastic bottles br br so now , i just ask my roommate to buy water for me when she goes home on the weekends i give her 4 , she runs to walmart and gets me 2 cases of 30 water bottles yay me ! br br sometimes i still think about this water , longing for it as i sip my coffee or tea or ramen juice and say to myself this would be so much better with talking rain br br its one college student 's battle between deliciousness and eco friendliness . 
somehow my previous review got deleted i live in houston , tx i buy lots of bottled water cannot tell any difference between a bottle of talking rain and a glass of cold tap water . 
yes the water appears clear , but once the water is heated for tea it turns the tea cloudy why is that , well it means it has impurities perhaps bacteria \? \? i'm a registered nurse not a water expert , but i can tell you that i am right about the water i can run my well water from my tap and get the same results , it 's awful i normally use brita filters with the pitcher provided and when i heat or even boil the water the tea stays clear this means no bacteria have been killed off by the heating process , it means you 'd be better off drinking the brita water ! ! ! ! ! ! i gave this bottle water a chance i got a second case and the same thing happen i would n't drink this water straight from the bottle ever as a nurse i know it 's not a good idea if you ever want to know if water is good or clear of bacteria impurities you can make lipton tea hot then , as it cools down if the tea turns very cloudy it has dead bacteria and other impurities i used the ice cubes made from this bottled water as well , so nothing is different except the tea tried the brita water and brita made ice cubes and it remained clear sorry not a good review from me i am afraid br br i was very disappointed as i thought yeah a bottled water i can carry to work , so i am not force to pay 1 50 for a bottle from the machine , but it turn out not to be so br br okay , so i tried another company on this website nestles which in my region came as deer park i have never tried this brand but it is so much better it does n't , t turn cloudy when i boil it so you be you own judge . 
do not buy this if your thinking its only mango ingredient says fruit juice blend \( organic white grape juice , organic apple juice and organic pineapple juice from concentrate , organic mango puree br br i cancelled order as soon as i realized this drink had grape and pineapple . 
consumer reports rated these crackers the highest in inorganic arsenic of all the rice crackers on the market i like these crackers , but will no longer eat them until the arsenic issue in brown rice is resolved . 
i 've been eating snow 's clam chowder for years , so i buy a few cans when it 's on sale well it looks like bumble bee has taken over what a big mistake when i opened the can , it was all watery and smelled funny i put it in a bowl to microwave , and noticed how thin it was , but thought i 'd try it anyway it was nasty to say the least it about made me sick so i went and opened another of the new cans , more of the same then i got an older can of the non bumble bee chowder and it was great like always if i could give the new junk no stars , i would sucks bad . 
the clams we 're ok overall , quality ext accept only calf the can is filled with clams and the other half is mostly juice also i expected larger chunks rather than small pieces product is good though . 
even on the small cup setting of the elite , these are a little weak for me make sure you shake the cups before putting them in your machine or they will be way too weak i also run a cup of hot water thru the maker before using these so there is no coffe taste to them . 
looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water no chocolate flavor whatsoever , this was a complete disappointment i got the hot chocolate k cups from swiss miss instead how people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me , is the amazon ratings system being gamed for this product \? . 
i found this too sweet am hoping there 's an unsweetened version available not very chocolatey too , kinda like swiss miss . 
it has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache this should say light or diet to let the buyer know this i would have never bought it had i known it seems like it would taste good otherwise . 
i have to admit based on most of the reviews i was sold on getting the 48 pack was a mistake all three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose that is the name of the artificial sweetner , in the product if you like splenda , you may like this but , it has a distinct taste unfortunately not for me a few friends of mine that tried it and said , it was n't bad unfortunately , that was the best of the comments br if you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try cafe escapes or swiss miss both are twice as good in my opinion liked the escapes best wish i liked the artificial sweetner , but the that taste has a distinct after taste probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar if your going to order i would get the small pack to try it better then throwing out 30 try cafe escapes and swiss miss and see for yourself . 
makes pretty good cocoa and a lot easier than on the stovetop not as sweet as i would prefer and needs to be stirred to keep it in suspension i guess i can add marshmallows \) . 
when i bought my keurig brewer , i eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker i'm still looking the grove square hot cocoa had a nasty aftertaste , almost metallic no amount of cleaning tinkering with the brewer made any improvement i used the brewer to make hot water for a nestle hot cocoa pack , and that was a far superior beverage the grove square quickly found it 's way to the trash i 'll find quality mixes and use the keurig to heat the water from now on . 
it 's okay but it does not have a rich chocolatey taste i actually find it to have a funky taste , ca n't quite figure it out . 
i was expecting something more considering the keurig does such a good job with coffee br but this stuff \? everybody who sampled it here said it tasted just like nestle 's powdered hot chocolate in a mug with hot water watery , sugary , and nothing special . 
i was hoping this was a good idea however we tried them even after i heard they tasted bitter like artificial sweetner and it was true not the same as the stuff from the can . 
i saw these on sale so i nabbed them for anything larger than a 6oz cup , the results will be too weak i end up brewing one with 6oz of water and then a cappuccino or something on top of it br br the peppermint was the flavor i was anxious to try but it ended up being the dark chocolate that i loved the most i'm on the fence about ordering hot cocoa k cups in the future it might be better to stick with canned cocoa and just use the water from my keurig . 
so if you are a person who likes swiss miss hot cocoa packets or hot cocoa from a gas station so do not get this product ! i can not taste any chocolate flavor in it whatsoever it just tastes like heated sugar water and nasty sugar water at that this product has a strong fake sugar taste and i am perfectly ok with diet sodas and other fake sugar products there is something about this i just can not put a finger on it but it made my stomach curl i even waited for it to cool down , but it got worse very disapointed in this product and it was not what i was expecting at all . 
all this is , is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a kcup delivery device what a waste of money also , grove square products are notoriously inferior . 
my kids like this cocoa , but i find flavor less delicious than the more expensive a href http www amazon com gp product b003vqxymq green mountain coffee hot cocoa , 24 count k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 2 \) a . 
very easy to use not the best flavor it has too much sugar and is not a quality i thought i was getting . 
my oh my is this cocoa sweet too sweet i 'd say you 're better off making hot cocoa from scratch i bought this because i thought the minty flavor would be good , but it 's too sweet so are the dark and milk chocolate flavors . 
the product is not bad , but must brew at smallest cup size or it has no flavor definitely an aftertaste watery . 
a hot chocolate packet was the first k cup on my new keurig \( it was 1 a m and i was n't ready for coffee before bed \) i had read they ran a little watery but i decided to try it on the 10 oz setting , took a sip , and tossed it the next morning i made one with 8 oz and added some whipped cream the taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery my husband made one to try at 6 oz and said it tasted like sugar water i might try combining 2 3 6 oz servings to use the box up but we wo n't be buying more . 
this product is nice and the price is right but it is n't swiss chocolate for sure br br just does n't have that real deep chocolate taste . 
i bought this brand of hot chocolate k cups cause it had the best review on amazon at the time the kids love it they especially like the peppermint flavor which i ca n't see any other way to get except in this mixed box you get milk chocolate , dark chocolate and peppermint flavors i tried it a few times and it is too weak for my taste i make it on the lowest setting on my keurig which i think is around 7 ounces and it is still weak to me but perfect for them if you like a strong chocolate flavor this is n't it . 
i hate sucralose br br honestly , i do n't know how other people can't taste it when it 's in sweetened products it 's got this unpleasant fake flavor that i just ca n't ignore i think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising br br that being said , it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the cafe escapes hot cocoa , and as such i have to give it higher marks than the competition br br still , i ca n't believe this product and its nearest competitor use sucralose but do n't say they 're a diet , lite , low sugar , or otherwise unnaturally sweetened product it 's frustrating i can taste the stuff , and i really dislike it i also do n't like the chemical makeup of sucralose , but i wo n't go into that here \( just believe me natural sugar is way better for you in the long run \) br br there 's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a k cup , and that 's swiss miss unfortunately , the swiss miss k cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find br br my opinion \? it 's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets , and use the hot water function of your keurig it 's not worth the k cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices spending more than seventy five cents per cup of water based hot cocoa is about the limit for me br br so , if you 're into sucralose splenda , then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not sugar flavor if you 're like me , though , and ca n't stand that artificial stuff , then avoid this product and find another option br br three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere br br update i just found out that the swiss miss k cups also use sucralose so really , your only choice is to get packets and use your keurig as a hot water dispenser how disappointing br br update 02 12 after some research , i found that there is one k cup hot cocoa that does n't have sucralose however , it is loaded with fructose instead \( not the greatest trade off , since it tastes different from sugar sucrose , in my opinion \) and has no actual sugar sucrose in it that one is green mountain coffee hot cocoa unfortunately , reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor \( probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil \) and is on the salty side , so i have avoided it it 's also more expensive per cup , and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty five cents \( as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars \) then go ahead and try it i will refrain at this point and stick to using packets br br i would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say , the cafe escapes hot cocoa k cups , swiss miss hot cocoa k cups , and grove square hot cocoa k cups all use sucralose yes , there is sugar in some of those , but it is in addition to sucralose splenda , and not by itself br br so your choices right now are pure sucralose , sucralose plus a sugar , or pure fructose none of them is appetizing to me , and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant br br 43 servings of sugar sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks , and it 's no more complicated than a k cup if you know how to operate a spoon . 
i really , really dislike sucralose i do n't like the taste , the aftertaste , or the after effects i bought this based on it not saying it was diet or low calorie the first ingredient is sugar so it 's only partially sweetened with sucralose sucralose is buried way down in the ingredients list but the taste is noticeable br br sure wish amazon contained the full nutrition and ingredients labels from all food products . 
since i am willing to try alot of new things i thought that i would buy this product and since i do like hot cocoa , i bought 2 boxes worst thing i could have done this is bland , with very little flavour it also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug br personally i will not buy this product again i will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the keurig k cup . 
does not have a rich chocolate flavor tastes a little watery not sure who a makes a great cocoa but this is not it . 
this tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and does n't taste very chocolatey the name brand cocoa kkups are better , or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better . 
just plain nasty ! ! ! this item tasted like cardboard , very watered down and no flavor to it at all very disappointed . 
thin , runny , and the fake milk powder used to add creaminess has an off flavor better off eating your ceramic mug . 
i do n't expect great hot chocolate from a k cup , but it should at least taste like there 's some cocoa in it i ca n't believe how bad this stuff tastes i tried it 3 times , and then threw the rest away . 
i wish i had listened to the other bad reviews the artificial sweetener taste is awful i gave two stars only because my husband does n't seem to mind i ca n't drink this even if they were a bargain . 
i looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa , but was very disappointed with the flavor it has an awful aftertaste , like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda also kind of weak , even on the smallest cup setting . 
so bad , i returned it my children did n't even like it , and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food . 
i bought this for my daughter and grandson they both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it therefore i will not buy it again . 
the artificial sweetener ruined this for me it leaves the fake sugar taste in your mouth and my husband , who drinks diet soda , even noticed at least it was n't pricey . 
good flavors in this combo not really strong but i will just set the machine on less water next time . 
i tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before i bought it , but could n't find anything online turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists , and yet , that did n't help the taste at all it is awful br br i had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and could n't find any takers i finally got rid it of it at the christmas white elephant gift exchange at work i put it with a nice cookbook , which was the real present , and wrapped it real prettily unfortunately , the boss ended up with it i have n't asked him if his family enjoyed it because i do n't want to put him on the spot judging by the reviews , there are a lot of people who like it hopefully , he will , too maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove , with milk , cocoa and sugar , and maybe a tiny pinch of salt compared to that , this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment br br anyway , instead of trying one of the other brands , i now heat some milk in the microwave , stir in a couple spoonfuls of hershey 's cocoa and some sugar to taste it takes about three minutes , and it 's delicious now , where did i put those mini marshmallows \? . 
i just got a keurig a few weeks ago and wanted to get some hot chocolate for it as an alternative to coffee i did n't have super high expectations , but these are absolutely awful there is a very strong plastic chemical taste to these k cups i tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help the only reason i gave these k cups 2 stars is because my boyfriend can tolerate them , but i do n't trust him because he 'll eat just about anything in his opinion they are not that good but he will still drink the mug br br from what i 've read of other hot chocolate k cups , you 'd be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way ! . 
well you get what you paid for while this milk chocolate k cup is pretty cheap 12 95 per 24 \( 54 cents per count \) but it is not good it tasted like watered down chocolate \( as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate cacao for that matter \) this thing is sweet tho , in fact kinda too sweet for my taste \( i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar sweetener \) i thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so i lowered the cup size from 8 ounce to 6 ounce on my keurig brewer and it 's the same thing . 
i like it ok , but it is n't anything great i have a hot water tap and it is just as easy for me to make the powder packs at home at a fraction of the cost i 'll go back to that method and save my for coffee . 
this is much too watery it tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine after receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients , i 've decided not to order again this product if definitely not worth the money . 
unfortunately , i am conflicted with my purchase br br although the final product was quite good , 4 stars the quality of the delivery is why they lost an additional star i opened the amazon box to find that there was hot chocolate powder coming out of the grove square packaging i opened it to find that 2 of the k cups were n't sealed properly on top and were spilling into the box i inspected both the amazon package and the grove square both of which had no visible exterior damage br br i was disappointed with both grove square for the quality of their product and as a result i am not sure i would buy this product again . 
the flavor of this cocoa is good , but i found that it was a little too watered down with the normal amount to water the second cup was better when i used less water . 
with a href http www amazon com gp product b00389q4xw green mountain hot cocoa a being perpetually out of stock in the winter , i thought i 'd give the cheaper grove square brand a shot br br since the k cup patents are starting to sunset , grove square is one of the first unofficial producers of we ca n't legally call these k cups but they work in your keurig \( r \) \( tm \) coffee maker pods , and i thought that i 'd be getting the same overall quality , without the licensing fees tacked on to the price br br well i was right about grove square being cheaper but i think that 's the nicest i can be br br as others have pointed out , there 's a definite diet or a href http www amazon com gp product b000e6lbxk splenda a aftertaste this had n't been reviewed yet when i bought it , so i did n't see the warnings from others , and re checked the ingredients several times to make sure br br well it 's got 60 calories , which seems a bit lower than green mountain , but a bit high for something that diet conscious people would want and the ingredient list did n't seem to point to obvious diet sweeteners br br the overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar free tootsie roll in your hot water , using the normal cup setting going one size down did n't seem to improve much , beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter but that just meant a heavier shot of low calorie sweetener to the taste buds br br the way i see it , i saved about 5 by going with this brand on the other hand , now i 've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if i ca n't sucker someone er please my discerning guests with a few cups br br if you drink diet soft drinks by choice , you 're probably going to like this . 
this tastes terrible like putting aritficial sweetener in already sweet hot chocolate the best i have tried so far is swiss miss hot chocolate k cups do n't think they are sold on amazon yet . 
had i known this cocoa was sugar free , i would not have purchased it i realize that this will not bother some people , but i really do n't like the aftertaste of fake sugar in the interest of fairness , this did not seem to trouble my nephew ! just update the description . 
my whole family \( 7 people \) tasted all 3 flavors and they are sickly sweet very disappointed that product has sucralose i would n't buy it again . 
using 8 oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak it was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup using 6 oz made the cocoa much too sweet , and still too weak in the chocolate department it uses sucralose as a sweetener , which gives it a very intensely sweet flavor this may not be a problem for those who like very sweet things or do n't mind the taste of sucralose unfortunately , i'm not one of those people . 
ca n't tell you how this tastes , because i read the ingredients first , but it has trans fats in every flavor \( the seller should disclose all ingredients in the description i would n't have purchased this otherwise . 
i received my order of grove square hot cocoa mix today , and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix i have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels i would urge amazon to require an itemized list of ingredients for all food items listed for sale if the ingredients had been listed , those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products . 
this does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use i is just not good . 
when i got my keurig i fell in love i bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa i'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut , partially because i ca n't have caffeine , and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards i really wanted to love this hot cocoa i tried all three flavors multiple times , in different ways i tried them on the different cup sizes , adding things , etc there 's just this strange taste to them that does n't sit well on the tongue i'm not sure what it is , but it has a faint ring of sour milk it really lingers , and i have n't found anything that takes the taste away i'm going to give my second box to a friend , she does n't seem to notice it my daughter and husband both said it tasted weird , so it 's not just me i also took it to a friend 's house and have tried them in three different keurig machines , just to make sure mine did n't need to be descaled so i guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes . 
i ordered this product because of a good price deal amazon shipped accordingly , absolutely no problems there however , the taste of this product was horrendous it tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it i personally will go back to buying swiss miss in a can and just using the keurig to give me hot water , cheaper and much better tasting . 
this has to be without a doubt the worst tasting hot chocolate ever ! the best way to describe the taste of this stuff is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate swiss miss instant is way better and cost less after only 3 cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this slop ! . 
this is okay cocoa it 's not really very smooth , and it 's a little watery i had high hopes , as i love dark chocolate hot cocoa , and the reviews were good i will finish the box i bought , but will try another brand next time . 
just got a new keurig and was looking for a great chocklate drink still looking this is fair at best watery and nothing to brag about . 
this is the best hot cocoa i have found so far , but i hope i can find better it 's not real chocolately wish it were a bit sweeter but on the whole , i would buy it again if i ca n't find better . 
fortunately , before i purchased i read through enough reviews of these k cups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar i'm shocked that the item descriptions do n't make this clear i consider that important information ! br br i decided to give them a try , anyway , considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell i realize that many products do this recently , but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste br br sadly , this one does too it 's close i can almost enjoy a cup but it 's still unmistakable , especially if you do n't consume much artificial sweetener \( i chew sugar free gum , and that 's it for me \) br br it 's a shame , too , because the chocolate flavor is nice in fact , i rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them and i was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before i found out about the sweetener but now i wo n't be buying any \( side note many cappuccino reviewers complained that they 're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino that would be fine with me , if it were n't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos do n't have \) br br if they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener , i 'd buy it , but until then i'm staying away from grove square products . 
i guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page does n't mention that the first ingredient is trans fat \( partially hydrogenated oil \) had i know , i would not have purchased this consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients . 
please stay away from artificial sweetners br br some of them actually change the shape of human cells br br this has an artificial sweetner . 
i 've been excitedly trying every type of k cup i can get my hands on since i got my keurig for christmas and , until now , have not encountered any that i truly hate until i discovered this one i would have though it pretty difficult to ruin hot chocolate but the people at grove square certainly did a good job not only was the hot chocolate watery , but it had a horrible plastic aftertaste also yuck ! . 
i ordered this specifically b c they said dark chocolate so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor they taste very watery , even using the lowest amount of water on the keurig the nutritional fact show that it only has 6 grams of sugar where the normal store bought powder has 22 grams i did n't like these at all if you 're going for something low sugar , they might be for you ! . 
i read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k cup on the market and decided to try this one first its not good even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct plasticy taste i think that this an inherent problem with all the k cup hot chocolates you just ca n't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it does n't taste watered down i'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way . 
this hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products we tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone we 'll be going back to the cafe escapes brand . 
just tried this for the first time today they are ok , but they do have an odd aftertaste not sure i 'll be ordering these again also the packaging notes that you need to run a hot water cycle \( without a k cup \) after making them \( i assume to clean the machine out \) . 
i ordered the dark hot cocoa in hopes it would be real chocolatey and it was no better than buying a pouch of hot chocolate and adding it to hot water i actually think the pouch added to hot water is loads better and a whole lot cheaper ! ! ! ! v e r y d i a p p o i n t e d ! for the price it's a rip off ! . 
the cocoa was n't too bad the taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes i was disappointed though when i went to a local store and saw it for less than what i paid just for shipping i really thought i was getting a good deal until i went home and checked the ticket i just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house ! so disapppointed ! ! \( . 
this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients br no real peppermint is in this product and to be honest it doesnt even taste like real cocoa is either . 
i ca n't believe i did n't check out the ingredients for this i never would have bought it if i would have known there was artificial sweetener in it ! first cup though , i got that weird after taste it gives and that was all she wrote if you do n't have a problem with a chemical taste or concerns about health problems , you may like it not worth it to us . 
found my kids actually cutting open the pods and dumping them into a cup to add hot water too they complained that lots of the good stuff stays in the pod kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging , so we switched back to packets . 
we prefer the swiss miss brand k cup this one was watery in both milk and dark chocolate this is my least favorite of all k cup brands . 
nice price , and glad to see a subscribe save option on k cups however this was undrinkable in our opinion did n't seem to be too watery like another reviewer said , just a bad off taste . 
i think the hot cocoa taste great but my wife thinks it is watery my wife is a big swiss miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa not sure i will buy again because of the cost of paying for the k cups sometimes i think you are better off buying swiss miss packets and just use the hot water function on the k cup machine . 
i did n't expect much from powdered cocoa in a cup , but here 's a tip put on 8oz setting , then add a 1 1 ratio of heated milk it tastes amazingly good ! br br of course if you add a little baileys irish cream , it tastes even better . 
thought i 'd try these because it 's a good price , but the chocolate flavor is not that good and the sucralose taste is very strong i like the swiss miss hot chocolate ones better , even though those have sucralose too , you ca n't really taste it . 
i have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink it has such a bad aftertaste that i checked the box to see if i ordered sugarfree by mistake ! i will toss this and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this , dont buy this brand its downright awful ! . 
we bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then cafe escapes dark chocolate it was also thinner in consistency wo n't buy again . 
we bought this to replace our cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa they are less expensive but you get what you pay for this cocoa is watery brown sugar water with an aftertaste i do not recommend it a href http www amazon com gp product b005k4q1t0 grove square hot cocoa cups , dark , single serve cup for keurig k cup brewers , 24 count a . 
i love hot chocolate and was very excited to find a variety pack , however , these are gross horrible after taste , my kids dont even like them now i have 3 boxes of the stuff that no one will drink very disapointed . 
i was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my keurig and even happier there was a variety pack i read the reviews and even there were some negative ones , i went with it anyways br i tried the milk chocolate it has such a weird taste to it but i gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night same weird aftertaste i asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds were n't off he commented that it had a hot plastic y aftertaste to it not even worth drinking too bad i have 34 more cups that will go to waste . 
as a hot chocolate lover , i was verrrrry disappointed when i tried this product i first had the peppermint \( disgusting \) and then tried the dark chocolate \( a little better \) the problem is that you can really taste the artifical sweetener i am a diet soda drinker , so i do n't have a problem with artifical sweetener it 's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste i definitely will not buy again i would not recommend these to anyone . 
i'm an avid hot chocolate drinker , and this is just does n't measure up it reminds me of the sugar free swiss miss no matter what size you set your cup on , it 's just missing that cocoa flavor maybe the dark chocolate would be better i personally like the cafe escapes milk chocolate better ! br br i bought a 24 pack , and then i was able to find it at my local grocery store , so i bought another one now , i'm stuck with the 24 pack . 
taste nothing like how cocoa should taste , i 'll never touch this again , i 'll be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck . 
this has artificial sweetener just like the other hot chocolates out there if anyone knows of one that does not have it , please let me know ! it definitely is n't very strong , but i coulod handle it if it did n't have the artificial sweetener aftertaste . 
everyone has their own preferences , i know i actually liked the flavor , but my wife tried it and could n't stand how sweet it was to each his her own , i guess but , now that i've had a second cup , i tend to agree very sweet . 
i bought this becaue they were 9 99 for the 24 pack i could try them for 50 cup other in the store were almost 1 cup overall they are ok good but you need to run a hot water flush throuhg you maschine afetr each use or there is a potential to have the residue gunk up you drain area .

there is a taste of sugar substitute , the aftertaste turns me off , i 've even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste it did n't , so i'm just using swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig . 
if anyone knows of one that does not have it , please let me know ! it definitely is n't very strong , but i coulod handle it if it did n't have the artificial sweetener aftertaste this has artificial sweetener \( sucorse \) just like the other hot chocolates out there . 
i enjoyed these k cups when i used them they tasted pretty good however , i quickly noticed that my keurig brewer began to have problems after i started using these and other grove square k cups even when i would brew other cups , i would get half brewed cups of coffee , smaller cups , and other issues i cleaned the brewer , following all the instructions and tips in the manual the issues came up again as soon as i used these k cups what i discovered is that the grove square k cups were gunking up my brewer badly i had to clean out every part of the brewer completely , including the brewer basket area , the water reservoir , and the internal mechanism after completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal i wo n't order any grove square products again . 
this hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it although , even the sugary taste is weak , and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose the consistency is watery and bland this is when i made the 8oz cup as directed by the directions on the box br br i do not recommend this product . 
i thought the grove hot chocolate is to sweet it also has an off taste i would not recommend this to anybody . 
i bought this to include in my daughter 's party bag it worked so well with the circus theme that we had unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale when i heard this the first time i thought no way ca n't be but then someone else told me the same thing and then i heard it again from someone else really disappointing i am so embarrassed . 
arrives 15 06 postage due in a used friendly 's box unfriendly do n't you think \? worst service ever ! ! ! ! ! totally unfriendly ! ! ! ! aweful aweful aweful service ! . 
it was n't a bad purchase at just 9 99 through warehouse deals fulfilled by amazon and shipped for free , but took 2 stars off because it was n't a freshness issue but cracker jacks just do n't taste the same like when i was a kid back in the 1980 's . 
ordered this and most of the boxes were stale and stuck together br br checked the expiration date and it was n't expired br br starting to think they just changed the expiration date and shipped everything that went bad . 
product was older then i would purchase if i knew what the date on the individual boxes was before purchase it gives me only one month to eat them all before being outdated . 
i do n't know the deal is here but they are terrible i love cracker jacks and not just cause there is a prize , especially now that the prizes are pointless compared to what you use to get br br these arrived and the first box i ate seemed very stale , checked the date and was not expired and the date was a long ways away so i figured maybe it was that box but i'm a few boxes in now and they are all the same it 's like chewing on cardboard i event went to the local 7 11 to get some to compare and those at 7 11 were 1000 timex better br br since it was so cheap to get them it 's not worth the hassle to send them back so i think i 'll just give them out for halloween . 
cracker jacks were horrible stale , not crunchy and tasted awful even though the expiration date on the package had not expired . 
i purchased cases of these for our company picnic the boxes were cute , the idea of it all was a big hit but the gift inside was a bust i would gladly have paid more for a stupid little item rather than the writings on paper , or whatever they were what is cracker jack without the gift inside \? i find it to be misleading that they call it original original had the gift inside . 
becareful if you plan to use these more then two months after you order them , they expire quick i ca n't use these , i ordered them to use in my november wedding but they expire in march \( . 
i really liked this flavor ! as someone with many food sensitivities who also avoids sugar , this is the perfect treat for me when i crave chocolate or baked goods the raw nuts are crisp and fresh tasting however , the price was very high for the quantity of product with less than 20 brazil nuts in the package , i felt a little gipped in future , i 'll try making my own chocolate nut mix from bulk raw nuts , berries , and coco powder rather than spend 9 per package ! for that price , i 'd like a lot more product . 
original description and order said assorted chocolates what i got weeks \( ! \) later was one pack of all white chocolates \( the least desirable \) not worth the bother of returning even with prime might be better just buying at local store \( same or cheaper price \) when you can see what you get . 
these look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored you would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor they taste like cheap kool aid and not the yummy jelly belly ones i ca n't seem to find on amazon . 
these arrived fresh and in a timely manner however , flavor wise our family is in agreement that jelly belly produces a richer plum flavor , slightly larger sugar plum in size , and a bit softer in texture for their sugar plums the price on the albanese sugar plums is reasonable , the flavor is good and it 's always nice to support a small , independent candymaker ! . 
perhaps amazon should start a scratch and dent section and sell items like this corn there ! all but one can of this great tasting corn was dented , severely ! dont get me wrong , i will still buy dented goods , but only at a discounted price the damage did not occur in transit either which disturbs me if they know they are selling dented cans , fine , but start a scratch and dent section ! ! ! ! ! ! . 
the fresh tasting libby 's organic corn , no additives ! i ca n't believe amazon can offer such good tasting corn in a can so cheap ! but for taste and value , this ca n't be beat . 
they decided to ship both my order in one huge box of 24 cans instead of 12 green beans in one box , 12 corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house then every single can of green beans was dented and 3 cans of corn were dented . 
this was a very good price for bulk ordering however my order was part of some gift bags we were putting together for 8th graders there was never intent to resell these due to ordering limitations , i was unable to order all 300 packs from here . 
the purchase and receipt of the box of chocolates was very good , and made my home in plenty of time for christmas the box was opened the day after new years the cholocates were discolored and dry the box had expired two months before i made the order i made a complaint with amazon which was resolved in a few days with full credit to my charge card this company wanted me to mail them back the chocolates which i had saved along with the wrapper they would not reply back to my inquiry as to who would pay for the shipping the chocolates back to the seller i still have the out of date and bad box of cholocate and will keep them for inspection for the next month or so then trash can . 
what more can i say barley edible crunch on sugar did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it did n't sell or maybe bad batch does n't make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth kids probably do n't care hope this helps . 
i was shocked to see that the bulk version of these jelly belly 's are just in a cardboard box , no plastic , no nothing does n't seem overly hygienic since i did n't open the box for a few months the jelly belly 's were getting softer and crystallizing unbeknownst to me because we live in a wet climate hmmm just be aware that the packaging should be upgraded . 
the box has only pasta and dried up sauce no tuna ! ! ! br br if you can see the words in the spoon on the bottom right of the box , it says , just add tuna br br so the products is making a false claim ! ! ! shame on you , annie . 
instead of a resealable tub with the jelly beans , i received a cardboard box , with a plastic bag full of jelly beans they were closed with a twist tie and there was no labeling on the bag on the box there was a typed label that said green apple jelly belly 16 oz new there was no ingredient list , company logo , allergen information , or anything else you 'd expect to find on food packages i certainly would n't eat food that arrived in a plastic bag with a twist tie i did ask that it be shipped next day , so maybe they could n't take the time to package it in the advertised tub amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund , which was the only positive part of the experience . 
i wait for this cereal to go on sale before i buy it and the sale price is usually 1 99 per 12 ounce box the regular price is about 4 br br 28 88 for 70 small boxes of less than one ounce each is 41 cents per box nearly per ounce the sale price is 17 cents per ounce the regular price is 33 cents per ounce br br on the other hand , this should make two rice krispie treats with one box starbucks sells rice krispie treats for 2 as one of their lowest priced snacks . 
i bought this for fathers day my father loves dried fruits and nuts br br it came in a somewhat cute crate box , and each compartment was in a plastic bag that means that if you do n't eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale , as they are now sitting in the open same story for the fruit br br while all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard chewy br br i recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece , but not if you actually want to eat it . 
i paid extra money to have this overnighted to my sister , and it turns out it arrived more than a day late that 's unacceptable to me . 
this is not a 20 oz bag it is only 4oz each bag misleading product thought i was buying 20oz bags not very happy should 've gone local for 8 dollars per bag . 
i love these delicious mangoes but the subscription option does n't ship at correct times i just received two shipments at once \( even packaged in the same box \) this week , when one of those shipments was supposed to be for april and i was not notified of that before they shipped and charged my card . 
i have to say that i really wanted to like these muffins , but i could not they have a really bitter after taste whether this is attributable to the gluten free nature of the product , i do not know the hodgson mill blueberry muffin mix is a far better choice on a positive note , they do raise very nicely , but it is unfortunate that i find them barely edible and have five more boxes of the mix left . 
i really wanted these to taste good , but there is something in there that is very bitter i had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable no one would eat them they looked delicious after baking and they 're healthy , but that 's only if you manage to choke one down i have tried their gingerbread , corn muffin mix , and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great . 
this item did n't have the pleasant taste that most of hodgson mills products have , such as the wild blueberry muffin mix however , i found it greatly improved the flavor added nutrition if i grated an apple into the mix it increased the much needed moisture , it was certainly a nutritious breakfast . 
this product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent gluten free as well as non gluten free baking products do not let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make this mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested gluten free product it lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well as with many gluten free products new to the market , you find yourself constantly adding something to try to make it right to these , i had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste i added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix this mix takes too much doctoring to be recommended at all until hodgson mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this but , hodgson mill does have other good products try their blueberry muffin mix and hope that one day amazon will carry a wider array of their gluten free offerings as many are very , very good . 
these came out smaller than i expected , but the taste as not as good as i thought it should be second time , i added a couple of items , which helped a little , but it is hard to find a great tasting boxed muffin mix i thought it would save me time , but i like my own muffins better my husband thought they were okay , but not great . 
i have never prepared anything so disgusting the taste was a mix of sour milk and cardboard , the smell just as bad i had to take the trash out because the whole room was beginning to smell i bake often , so i know it 's not a kitchen error and i'm not that picky , but i could not stop gagging i would recommend pamela 's brownies add extra dark chocolate and they 're delicious as brownie bite cookies \( side recipe on the bag \) i even make them super healthy and use 1 2c applesause instead of oil ! . 
i bought these at my local grocery store i wish i would have read the review on here first the positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin the negative is they are so bitter i could barely finish my half i just recently found out i have celiac disease so i cant have gluten i have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so i can not compare it to any others i have tried the betty crocker gluten free brownie mix and that is wonderful so i do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there . 
i was really excited and surprised when i found this mix in my local wal mart given it was a good price , i figured id give it a shot before i whipped up a batch i figured id do a little investigating to see if there was any input suggestions on the mix wow is everyone using the same mix or what \? reviews from its great to its horrible like a total 50 50 split soooooo , before i wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself , i figured id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix , all on its own ummmmm , yeah it totally has a pretty strong bitter after taste and , like another reviewer , i had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener \( i dont like things very sweet , at all \) but its def not as i re read the ingredients i realized there isnt any sugar sweetener in this mix so , youd def need to add sweetening but , overall , i dont even plan on taking this mix that far im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away id strongly suggest avoiding this mix i hope the company works on this mix it has good elements to it \( i like the fact you can determine how sweet youd want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty \) and i think it could be really tasty . 
if i could , i would give it zero stars i am not a picky eater , but this mix did not rise \( can you say hockey puck \) , was extremely bitter , and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added save your money . 
i bought this because i have celiac disease and was really craving some muffins i am not a health nut , i just ca n't eat gluten with that said , this is nasty it calls for very little sugar , i figure for the health nuts , so i simply added more sugar since it said to sweeten to taste even with extra sugar , it leaves an extremely bitter taste in your mouth i would rather pass on muffins than ever taste something like this again on a positive note , the muffins do stay together and look like muffins and if you try the product and dislike it , you can mail in the bottom of the box and your purchase price for a refund . 
i concur with previous reviewers in that these muffins have such a bitter taste ! i also bake often and i'm certain it was n't me my gluten eating husband did n't like them either they were also dense br if you are looking for an apple cinnamon flavor and need a mix , you might be better off using pamela 's baking mix \( which is awesome ! \) and adding apples and cinnamon to it the muffin recipe is on the back of the pamela bag br in conclusion , i do n't recommend these they were really disappointing . 
i bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased earth 's best organic vanilla cookies , had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids needless to say , i should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through amazon \( which you are unable to return even unopened boxes since this is a food item \) the crackers smelled strange even before tasting them my 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few i wish i could describe the taste , but it would be really hard it may sound strange for an organic food , but it was almost like a faint chemical smell at best , i can say that they were n't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor \( even as an organic option they should have a better taste \) my 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint , so i am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so i feel like i did not waste my money good price , but definitely test one box first to see if you like them . 
i really did n't notice elmo on the package \? these are for kids more than adults nothing wrong with flavor , but priced for kids that scream alot . 
these cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose i did n't realize until i tried one , and ended up with a little bit of a headache , which made me check the ingredient list it is n't noted on the front of the box they definitely have an artificial taste , i would not buy them again . 
i'm dieting , and i use these as a treat to myself , when i'm craving chocolate i usually brew one of these one of my coffee k cups \( either plain or hazelnut \) br br for 60 calories , it 's not a bad way to satisfy a chocolate craving when you 're on a calorie budget ! . 
this hot cocoa is the nastiest tasting instant cocoa i 've ever had i know it 's not going to taste like the real thing , but after just three cups i ca n't bring myself to finishing the box i think i 'll just throw them out our k cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we 've tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa the first try was very watery so i thought the cup size needs to be reduced this results in just a sweeter cup of hot water stick with coffee . 
these have an artificial sweetener aftertaste not pleasant i would not purchase them again this the first kcup hot chocolate i 've tried , i 'll keep looking . 
this product tastes like muddy water maybe because it is out of date ! \? ! i do n't know but i 'll not buy this again . 
these were a little disappointing the hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strange kind of plastic tasting have n't been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig . 
after trying several of these k cups , we threw the rest of the box away it only ever created flavorless brown water we then tried the grove square dark chocolate cocoa k cups , and were much happier . 
sure to be a hit with chalk a holics everywhere , from first sip to last this product suggests its european heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern france br br some seem to be making a case for it only having 60 calories , but the keurig chai latte only has 70 , and that product actually tastes pretty good br br i have yet to find a keurig compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old swiss miss , scooped from a tub or a foil packet and swiss miss is n't that great to begin with , although it sure is cheaper than this stuff br br i wonder if the size of the keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup , so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised . 
this product is not sweet enough for me and tastes better with marshmellows already in the cup while brewing watery texture was a disappointment . 
this one has a major problem it 's waaaay too watery , even at the recommended settings the chocolate flavor is okay , and it 's not overly sweet \( although it still is n't great dark chocolate flavor \) the really issue is that there is n't any creaminess , and adding milk only dilutes the flavor even more blech ! i 'll pass , and i'm throwing the rest of the box out . 
just got a new keurig and immediately went on a search for br the best dark rich bold coffee \( caribou mahogany \) and other brands br with rich taste \( wolfgang is winning so far \) but really wanted to find br the best hot cocoas and got these first now trying to give them away br the are even worse than the packaged kind you get in the stores actually , br i think i 've found better instant ones i hate to write a bad review but if br you want to find a delicious cocoa mix in the k cups get the grove \( station \) brand br here on amazon they are always sold out \( which duh i know why now as they are a far better br tasting brand \) but if br you put your email on a wait list , they 'll let you know when they come in and br you dont have to wait very long i 'd stock up though , as you 'll find you want a cup br or two every night ! \( and the dark , milk and peppermint combined box is the bomb ! ! \) i just br sent a couple boxes out to a friend of mine who was complaining about how bad the k cup hot br chocolates were she 'll be thrilled to get my care package ! ! . 
gross ! i tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes the flavor is all fake sweetener \( odd since sucralose is the last ingredient \) and no dark chocolate i am bummed because now i have a box of these cups and do n't want to drink them . 
my son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies the taste is okay the texture is hard and weird even when microwaved short shelf life if you are buying in bulk not absolutely terrible but worse than average try pamela 's chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful , or try a baking mix . 
i was excited to try this sauce based on the reviews , but it 's nothing special for my taste , it 's way too sweet and not nearly spicy enough \( even my kids agree \) it reminds me of honey mixed with sweet pickle relish , so if that sounds good to you , go for it but if you 're more interested in something more spicy , hot and even a little sour , you might want to keep looking . 
these are very large bottles it is a good dipping sauce with a sweet spicy flavor . 
i was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews , i took a chance well , no one in the family likes this stuff it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce more like what it says it is chili sauce now i'm stuck with two huge bottles sometimes reading the label is really all that matters . 
i went to check out and found out that the freight is 14 00 on an 11 00 \( canned , not fresh produce \) \? \? ! ! ridiculous ! ! . 
panda has good flavor but the texture and shape is not the best it does not have enough chew and i find it a bit dry br br i much prefer rj 's with it 's big solid tubes and excellent natural licorice flavor and satisfying , just right chew without being gummy . 
i 've found a new licorice , , this one is ok , but i really do n't need the extra sodium in my body . 
the melitta java pods have a slightly smaller circumference than the senseo pods and are thicker if you are using a senseo coffee machine , you probably should moisten the java pod and smooth it before attempting to latch the lid otherwise , you risk breaking the latching mechanism the resulting decaf coffee is not bad and seems to this reviewer to have a richer taste than the senseo decaf pods the melitta java pods are not really designed for the senseo machine and several other brands such as halo , fratello and millstone work better in the senseo machine . 
although this coffee tastes fine there is nowhere enough coffee in the pod the cup that is brewed even with a smaller amount of water is weak and watery . 
my husband did n't care for this coffee at all he complained it lacked flavor and aroma . 
some issues with the product some of the pods are not sealed properly so the grounds spill out \( either before use or after use into your coffee \) it is wasteful that each pod is individually sealed would rather they be packaged like the senseo pods the pods do n't really fit my senseo coffee maker too fat for the single and too small for the double which causes problems sometimes when i brew a cup on the plus side price . 
melitta pods are full flavored however , they do not fit my senseo coffee machine one pod in a two pod holder is too small and two pods are too large sure do wish senseo was still readily available in the super markets ! . 
to make a decent cup of coffee i have to use two pods at a time i prefer a strong cup of coffee even if it is decaf br what happened to senseo decaf \? . 
this coffee a href http www amazon com gp product b001m0508y melitta one one java pods , breakfast blend coffee , 18 count pods \( pack of 4 \) a is terrible cheap beans , bad roast , whatever , my lot actually tastes like it is moldy maybe i just got a bad batch i have tried the buzzworthy dark roast melitta pods and they are drinkable , even though i prefer medium roast coffees suggest you try one box of these , not the 4 box lot i'm stuck with also , to help you evaluate this response better , you should know that i like quality roast kenya aa or sumatra or columbian supremo , etc rich flavor type coffees i do n't like folgers , maxwell house , pedestrian type blends , but even those are way better than this coffee . 
i have a melitta one one machine and have been using juan valdez pods in it when i ran out i searched for pods for it only came up with these melitta brand ones i figured \( incorrectly \) that the others were n't available purchased these very disappointing my coffee had been nice , strong tasty , but coffee made with these is weak tasteless i bought a 4 box package of three different types am now stuck with them forget these head to juan valdez \( same price range \) unless you like weak coffee . 
a decent , clean , and simple cup of morning decaf i find pre wetting the pod helps extract a little extra flavor . 
parisian cafe' was not may favorite blend for breakfast coffee i prefer others of the melitta brand . 
i can get it at walmart for 1 78 each or the gas station for 3 50 for 2 why , just why \? . 
i'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that truffle oil is receiving on amazon ! those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny 17 bottles of truffle oil are made in a laboratory there 's not a molecule of actual truffle in them it 's a sinful shame that 's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening new york times article called hocus pocus , and a beaker of truffles read it and weep br br and if you see truffle oil advertised on the menu somewhere , you might ask if they 're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes . 
it 's not real crispy , sticks to your teeth and lots of hulls br br i know homemade popcorn has a few more kernel hulls than your store bought microwave , but it 's a little too much for me i was really hopeful for this brand but , it just did n't work out i tried a couple of different methods popped using different temperatures , and also tried different oils it was the same both times with no improvement it does n't get better after it cools either nothing worked to improve it br br it does n't taste old , so i know it 's not that i seal my popcorn kernels when i'm not using them as well the flavor is really mild and it 's definitely a good tasting popcorn it just does n't turn out the way it should . 
if you 're used to dave 's insanity sauce , or like me you 're used to dave 's ultimate insanity sauce , you 're going to be really disappointed 5 of the 6 sauces are n't spicy at all they 're probably at a spiciness level below tobasco sauce i tried really hard to like them but i just ca n't get over how watery and weak they are the only saving grace of the package is that it comes with a bottle of regular insanity sauce , but as i mentioned above , i prefer the ultimate insanity sauce i guess i have plenty of salad dressings . 
i am a casual sauce user and the taste of these sauces was just ok nothing special the insanity hot sauce was fun to try though i probably would not purchase again since they are pretty darn expensive . 
i 've been looking for a long time for a beer sausage that was hot to the taste that i use to enjoy back in the deep south when i was a kid growing up so far , i 've not been able to find the sausage that rang my bell these arrived quickly and they are tasty and i am glad that i did order these , however , they are not as good as the ones i use to eat when i was in my teens br br i gave the product a 3 star rating because they were tasty , but not what i was expecting i know many of you will enjoy these and you 'll probably rate these as a 5 star item , but i must be honest to provide the best rating possible the 3 stars were for the lack of qualilty in taste they are not hot as one is led to believe hot makes you sweat , these do not . 
tried these the other day because of the low price and regreted it from the moment the jar was opened these sausages tasted like card board soaked in beef flavored vinegar im used to eating glazier 's pickled sausages that snap when you bite them guess i will stick to what i like . 
the product was advertizes as hot sausage s the lable on jar say s hot sausage but they not even warm the sausage s do have agood flavor but just pickled we have been serving these type of products at our vfw for year 's so i know what i'm talking about . 
while i gave it the benefit of the doubt confirmation was ascertained on the second bite that it tastes like vomit . 
i ordered this prouct along with 2 others i bought all together to get the free shipping over 30 what really happened is that each item shipped from a different location and i was charged seperate shipping for each the shipping was such that i could buy these products more cheaply at the corner drug store i feel i was misled into overbuying and was left feeling ripped off by amazon this is the experience i shared with my friends after this purchase i bought books from walmart on line for the first time . 
this roasted green tea was only so so to my taste i 've found others i like better since i purchased this however , it arrived in a box of twelve boxes \( each with 16 or so tea bags \) way too much ! then i found that we ca n't return food items , so i now have a lot of tea . 
however , for the price and additional shipping cost \( if not receiving that free \) , i would not say this is a such a good value not sure what makes the tuna more pricey than something like the freeze dried salmon if these were the only treats available to the cats , they likely would not last even one week in this small amount in the future , i 'd be more apt to open up a 69 cent can of tuna , which they are just as fine with . 
the tea was a lot milder in flavor than i was expecting , but still pleasant the aroma was light i probably would not buy this again , but that 's only because i would like a more intense flavor . 
i love the product but , the bottle design is terrible in order to get the last 1 3 or so of the body wash out of the bottle in a timely manner you would normally store the bottle upside down with the pointy top that is impossible so , you must stand in the shower the try to shake the remaining product the length of the bottle to squirt it out this takes much more time that you 'll want it to take redesign the bottle with a flat top please . 
i will never understand the soaps from mainstream , and sometimes otherwise great brands , who claim to have a line of sensitive skin products which still contain sodium lauryl or laureth \( as in this case \) sulfate if you 're someone who needs sensitive skin products there 's a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without sls boo refer to their bar soap , which is wonderful . 
this product gave me a horrible rash it contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens they need to list allergens . 
i do n't enjoy giving products a bad review but i was so disappointed i had to i 've tried quite a few teas and i 've been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so i can get down some pretty harsh teas i usually do n't use any type of sweeteners either because i drink my tea right before bed i 've tried to give this tea a chance ive tried it with sugar , honey and lemon and masking the flavor with vanilla and a little milk to me , this tea smells like dirty feet and probably tastes like them too i 've also tried straight chamomile teas before too so i know it 's not that i would rather eat the plant itself than drink this tea i have n't tried any other twinings products so this review is strictly for this product . 
something to eat if you're starving but please give real food to hungry people , br br what 's in kellogg 's corn flakes \? milled corn , sugar , malt flavoring , high fructose corn syrup , salt yes , of course , it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as bht and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities for nutrition you get basically 100 carbs from lots of sugar and almost no protein add skim milk , or you 'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk for added nutrition , include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ br br if you like corn flakes , that is your business and you should enjoy them , but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0 29 cents an ounce 3 49 per package at this price , the inner package 's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff why not use a vacuum sealed container like kretschmer 's wheat germ to preserve freshness \? after all , it 's in the same price range ! br br so if you are hungry , you are really eating the wrong stuff something to eat if you are starving but please give real food to other hungry people please ! . 
it saddens me to say i had to return this item the item 's page specifically said the calamares were packed in olive oil however on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil an unhealthy oil that was the bad news the good news is amazon , as usual , was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be 'not returnable' that is why i buy everything online from amazon com they are the best . 
watch out for this because i wanted what was pictures however i got different colored flowers they use local vendors and it depends on what they have in stock the flowers still looked beautiful , but i was expecting the white and pink flowers my wife got orange and yellows one instead . 
these bags never close well , so if you are a compulsive bag closer , forget about it ah , the taste you ask \? dry , and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews and why , oh , why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure ish stickers on the back of their vehicle \? please , just go straight for the original chips ahoy ! in standard size , pig out , and forget about the kids for six minutes . 
i did not know that i was ordering biscuit crumbs that is exactly what i received such a lousy product it 's amazon 's fault for shipping out expires products will never order food from amazon com ever . 
i meant to pick up the normal chewy chips ahoy and was flabbergasted when i returned home to find that they shoved the word oatmeal in the corner of the package but kept everything else the same i decided to try them anyway and the oats definitely interrupt the normally wonderful chemistry between the chocolate and dough br . 
chips ahoy , chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces my tastebuds say they are too sweet , not cooked enough , lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes if you like cookie dough , you most likely will enjoy these i 'll stick with a crunchy , less sweet cookie . 
when i eat junk food , i 'd like to enjoy it , the guilty pleasure it is br br these cookies are neither healthy or tasty stick to chewy chocolate chip cookies . 
tastes pretty crappy it 's like raw cookies br br it 's not even like a cookie it 's a squishy thing in a cookie shape . 
i purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies wrong ! i like chocolate chip and i like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just do n't work well together i wish i had read the item listing more carefully even my kids said blech ! . 
after eating tang 's chocolate and double chocolate cookies , all other cookies will taste like expired , tepid dogfood to you her cookies will enhance your life in ways you never dreamed possible tim horton 's , timothy 's , second cup , starbucks , treats and those horrid packaged cookies at zupas are just pathetic imitators to the grandeur that is a tang cookie her cookies are da bomb ! ! ! a hawt damn ! . 
overall i was not happy with the crumbiness of these cookies they were way to fragile and crumby there is just too many crumbs in my bed , how am i supposed to sleep like this \? . 
skinless sardines in water differ from the ones with skin in oil in that they are somewhat coarse and dense as opposed to the softer texture of sardines in oil not much fishy odor and the liquid is flavorful . 
i have been purchasing this product for about 9 months the taste of the product is inconsistent from lot number to lot number i have gotten 3 cases where the chips had no flavor at all have contacted the manufacturer 2 times have not received a response from my latest inquiry i do n't recommend purchasing . 
i bought these because i had decided i wanted to eat , and even snack , healthier these had so many good reviews , so i decided to try them i admit , it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first when i opened them , they looked totally unappetizing and then i tasted them it tasted just like a rice cake styrofoam with salt on it they also have a very unusual texture the combination of taste and texture was very disappointing my teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way not even the dog would eat them we tried them with a variety of dips and could n't come up with a tolerable way to choke them down br br luckily , i have a niece that is newly vegetarian , hungry all the time , and she took these off my hands i am still out 25 for buying the case of these to begin with what a waste ! . 
the product that i received was not the product that was pictured and described on the item 's page the worst part of it all was that when i attempted to return the case of soy crisps , i was unable to do so amazon said that this was a non refundable item so i wasted 30 00 and i am stuck with a case of soy crisps that i will not eat . 
just plug and play with your preferred software no hassles , worked great for about 3 months then just stopped working did n't drop it \( it is made of a flimsy plastic and is light as a feather feels cheap \) it just stopped working when i buy a product i do n't just want it to work great for three months totally dissapointed . 
owned two of these and when they work they are fine the power knob has no indicator on it though my biggest problem , and the reason i will never purchase another , is this both gave out with in a year one now sounds like i am recording from behind a wall and one developed a hum that will not go away do yourself a favor and find a more reliable option . 
great audio , until a few months in it just decides to stop working common problem google it and you 'll see cheapest construction of any product every designed in the entire world feels like a fast food toy br br i do not recommend this product piece o' garbage . 
i will admit , the icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an xlr jack to your computer using a usb jack it does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software br br beyond that , the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level br br i tried this with an akg 200 , blue encore 200 and an akg 4500 all deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain i could barely get an audible record level yelling into the encore 200 , my staple for location voice recording normally , i plug the encore directly into a digital audio recorder with an xlr cable no mic preamp , no phantom power , no eq , and i get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level br br this is one very disappointing product if you route your mic through a preamp , then put the icicle between the preamp and the usb input of your computer , you can get a decent record level , but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid personally , i think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip or mic preamp and an xlr to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the icicle altogether br br blue makes some great products , but this is not one of their better ones br br for those that do n't know , channel strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box typically a mic preamp and a compressor higher end units add some eq capability as well or have other options . 
this product was awesome the first couple months , i was convinced i was over any potential defective period well , after caring for it well and giving it no reason not to work , it of course stopped working for me i now ca n't use it for anything serious anything i record that is profound or important runs the risk of cutting out half way without giving any warning leaving me with half a recording of audio and half with crickets there must be some crappy design inside the tube that prevents establishing a solid connection , i'm just happy it 's not my 100 blue microphone ! do n't waste your money on the icicle , it 's productive ability has an expiration . 
cheap a plastic tube with some presumably lightweight circuit inside never worked right no user interface , no known way to engage or defeat the phantom power . 
i was told by the salesman at guitar center that the icicle was easy and very high quality it is perfectly easy but i have had nothing but problems from mine there is a constant popping in anything i record i am using an akg c3000b microphone i have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic anyone else having this problem \? have n't been in touch with tech support yet , but i will say i am not happy with the icicle . 
icicle is a pretty good preamp for the price br br very easy setup and a cool design , but definitely was not very rigid it 's very light and made of plastic br but the one things that i did n't like was the noise it had a fair amount of buzz along with it br br a cheap preamp for the price , but you get what you pay for . 
i find that even with the gain on maximum , the volume is not very loud i use it with a shure sm57 mic and my macbook \( using audacity \) one must be very close to the mike and speak somewhat loudly when i use the shure mics with a mixer \( the analog way \) , there are no volume problems br br it is simple to set up , being almost plug and play you have to choose the input source . 
the product was simply not recognized by my windows 7 home premium computer very disappointed , considering on the blue website it says that it is i gave this the extra star because im sure its a great product , but the lack of communication of the compatibly was very disappointing most likely wont be buying anything else from blue . 
the level from this unit was hard to adjust , and when all was said and done , it was very low . 
i have several different ways of connecting xlr microphones to my computers for use in webinars , and i thought this design would be simpler to transport and connect , but when i tried to use it with a shure sm58 mic the volume it produced was about 25 of what i am used to , and was not adequate for my purpose . 
i had this product for literally only a week , and had only used it one time when trying to use it again i found that it was n't sending the sound through when i plug it into my pc , it recognizes it and the icicle lights up , and i select it as my recording device , but then when i actually try to record , it makes no sound at all \( and i have tried moving the gain knob around so it 's not that \) this was a complete waste of money , unless there 's an easy fix that i'm missing . 
it does record with ease and decent quality for the price the only problem is it acts as a sound card and you ca n't record and listen to yourself at the same time without latency this is a deal breaker for me blue microphones should add a headphone jack onto the interface so you do n't have to listen to recordings through your computer and you can hear your recordings in real time . 
this does not work on windows 7 , tried reinstating software and to no surprise it di n't work this was a waste of time and money be aware of this issue . 
i have been using a standard xlr to usb cable with my shure 58 dynamic mic , which works okay , except for an annoying hissing noise that accompanies the majority of my vocal recordings i bought the icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues br br when i received the icicle , i could n't wait to plug it in and take it for a test drive unfortunately , right off , i got an error unable to load drivers this is a plug and play device , so there are no drivers to download , and i knew something was n't right after 3 restarts and uninstalling the usb hubs and ports numerous times , as suggested by icicle 's troubleshooting website , it was still a no go i went to icicle 's website and logged a ticket , explaining the issues in detail and that i was running windows 7 the next day , i received an email instructing me to send the icicle back , as it has a defective driver amazon was great about sending a replacement while the return was on its way br br so , i received the replacement icicle today , pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath , plugged it in , hoping for success no such luck the same error message came up about the drivers i decided to google my issue icicle compatibility with windows 7 , and bam ! , it took me to a guitar center review of the icicle that clearly shows in the product specifications that it is not compatible with windows 7 br br amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information it is nowhere in amazon 's description and the icicle techs themselves did n't have a clue about it either i found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable they probably have non technical csrs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting that 's one way to save a dime , but please people if you 're going to give us technical support , then say so if it is n't really technical support , then say it is customer service br br i am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies windows 7 has been out for some time now there is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the icicle package that says windows 7 is incompatible it only gives set up info for mac and windows \( does not show which os \) i am sending my icicle back to amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that will work with windows 7 br br if you have a pc that was purchased in 2011 or later , save yourself the hassle and do n't bother with this product , as your os will more than likely be windows 7 . 
picked one up to use with a laptop running windows 7 home premium the computer saw the item , but said it needed troubleshooting nothing worked after researching online , i found that many people had run into this problem apparently , the firmware is not compatible with windows 7 it 's supposedly been corrected in newer runs , but there 's no way to tell if the one you 're purchasing is newer or not i tried contacting blue , twice , hoping to get a firmware update , or check into exchanging it , but never got a response from both attempts , so i finally just had to return it . 
i 'll add to the growing list of reviews here regarding the windows 7 usb audio device error i figured i had a 50 chance of it working it did n't windows 7 insists on loading a usb driver that does n't work there is a review here giving details on how to possibly circumvent this loading process , however , that did not work for me its easier to return this thing , than spend my whole weekend jerking around in windows 7 hardware manager br br blue probably has a good product here , and probably blames windows for this issue however , blue should provide a driver that works do n't rely on windows to do this that is corporate laziness spend some resources on programming something that works for windows 7 make it available on your support website , and make it true plug and play not plug and cross fingers , then spend hours messing around in the weeds of windows settings br br also agree with other reviews here in the 2 days i spent with this product it 's all plastic parts , feels cheap and fragile , and the gain button is poorly thought out br br hey blue you had my business then you lost me i'm moving on to something else . 
purchased and it came looking new , as i had bought it new , but it was actually damaged br customer service with the actual company is awful as i needed to contact the company itself to return it . 
used it a couple of times over the course of a month , and it worked great ! third time , high pitched noise , and no mic signal coming through not too surprising , given how flimsy this thing feels this is apparently a known issue , just look at other 1 star reviews of this product 'nuff said ! . 
i wanted to like this product , as it would have been a fast and easy solution for many of my needs , but it did n't work well at all very noisy lots of hissing and pops that are completely absent when using the same mics and computers with other adapter devices considering the decent reviews by others , i may just have a defective unit either way it 's going back in the mail today . 
i bought this before i purchased the mxl micmate it is plastic , and very cheaply made i felt like it would break very easily , and would not be something that would last me a while so then i bought the micmate it is solid metal , and is way better sound quality than this i beg you to buy that over the icicle buy the mxl used \( like new \) from themintmovieman , a great seller and it is a great product a href http www amazon com gp product b000vz8wc2 mxl micmatec xlr to usb preamp for condenser microphones a . 
never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings for the price paid , it 's very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired overall , i can not recommend this product at the current price it 's sold at 15 to 20 dollars , then sure still , it 's an ok product . 
it is what is is and it did the job that it was made for lasts long if u take care of it but is easily out grown when just starting ur own studion . 
i used the icicle for about two hours after taking a break , i plug it in and my laptop wont recognize it i did everything i could think of to fix this , even hours of searching google nothing in the process of a return it would 've been perfect if it just worked . 
it works reasonably well with condenser microphones with dynamics the hum exceeds the signal works with windows , not with linux the build is very cheap anything more than 5 for this is too much . 
i bought this device and use a brand new sure 52 with it br br the noise and feedback i received with this device was horrible i might have a bad unit br br when i called customer service , a real person answered right away and offered to expedite getting me a new unit \( very cool and is why i gave them 3 stars for now \) br br i 'll see how that process goes and update my review . 
shipping ordered on a sunday of week 1 placed in box on a friday of week 2 received it wednesday of week 3 whoever 's responsible for shipping \( amazon or blue \) took their sweet time to drop it in this 8 x5 box br br product currently testing the converter with a shure pg58 gain is incredibly low and a annoying tone when recording i do believe the product is in working condition too bad i have to figure out how to edit the hardware properly . 
i ordered this item on march 22nd i expect to get its replacement from the people at blue sometime today so , what 's a month , anyway \? the first one that came from amazon had a constant , high pitched tone i emailed , then called blue , and eventually spoke to a pleasant tech support guy who was aware of the problem he allowed that the company had shipped out a number of units with this defect that 's always good to hear so , several emails later , i received a return merchandise authorization , and shipped it right back to them who knows , if this one works , maybe i 'll like it blue 's products look good , but they make a strong case for buying locally . 
been gluten free for 7 years now thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful we threw it away because we did not like it for my money , you ca n't beat pamela 's baking mix but , the betty crocker chocolate chips are the best ! so , do n't give up betty crocker , just work on this one ! . 
the first brand of gf pancake mix i attempted was bob 's red mill and i loved it i went to the store to try to find it again and this was all they had so i tried it it 's okay i'm egg free too and used mushed banana instead , so maybe that contributed to the slight mushy texture but i made a batch of egg ones for my in laws and they said it was a bit mushy too br br it 's not horrible , but i prefer brm brand personally . 
i was hoping bisquick got it right when they released this product , but they missed their mark br br i made both biscuits and dumplings \( chicken dumplings \) the biscuits came out okay but the flavor was bland the dumplings were fluffy but not very flavorful and turned hard after a day or two . 
i was disappointed when i tried this pancake mix before going gluten free , bisquick was our go to pancake mix , so i had high expectations for the gluten free mix the texture was a little weird soft and dry i prefer the pamela pancake mix over this one . 
i love pancakes , so giving up gluten was hard for me i 've used bisquick for pancakes for years with great results alas , the best i got from the gluten free version was edible , but not enjoyable it tasted a lot like pillow foam , not in a good way i will probably keep the mix for breading things , but not for pancakes i 've found much better options . 
this mix makes great belgian waffles we tried biscuits and pancakes and we do far better form scratch with a standard gf flour it does make seriously great waffles though , and we go gf df on these the waffles freeze extremely well and reheat in the toaster quite nicely . 
it is good i prefer the taste of baking mixes from scratch , but for store bought , it 's pretty good much cheaper in local grocery stores under 5 per box at my local stores in chicagoland area . 
rice flour , sugar , leavening \( baking soda , sodium aluminum phosphate , monocalcium phosphate \) , modified potato starch , salt , xanthan gum , may include soy ingredients . 
overall , this mix is okay , but , the sugar content is very , very high you can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely for pancakes or waffles , this is fine , but for savory concoctions , this is not acceptable sausage balls , casseroles , and biscuits all come out almost inedible this mix is also oddly gritty the grit is very fine , but still makes my teeth want to curl i recommend pamela 's baking and pancake mix , as it is smoother , and much more versatile , because it 's not as sweet a good cook knows you can always add more of something , but you ca n't take it out if you 've added too much br br that being said , if you 're traveling and this is the only mix they have , it 's better than nothing . 
i was so excited to get this and try it unfortunately i'm not impressed br br for starters the value is terrible you get 3 cups of mix per box that 's enough to make 1 batch of pancakes and 1 batch of biscuits \( or 3 batches of pancakes whatever \) for almost 4 50 a box that 's not worth it to me especially when the end result is mediocre at best for the biscuits i made cheddar biscuits and not even the bread loving toddler would eat them the pancakes were okay if i used twice as much real maple syrup as i normally do br br the pro 's \? br the biscuits did puff up nicely that 's the only pro i have . 
second ingredient is sugar ! need i say more \? make your own bisquit mix , it 's super easy ! . 
i made pancakes and biscuits with this mix and found them to be mediocre at best i really tried to like this product , but the taste is just so far off for me i wanted a break from making things from scratch , but this just was not worth it . 
i ran out of pamela 's mix and bought this in a regular grocery store because it was all they had i followed the pancake recipe on the back as a person with celiac who has tried many things , i knew when i saw the fine , crystalline mix it was n't going to be good the batter is pasty looking the pancakes were too dense and slightly off the end product was pretty bland you will be much better off with pamela 's mix pamela 's can be served to a gluten eater i cannot say the same for this product . 
the rice flour in it is a crude gritty grade \( cheap \? \) if you 've ever used thai rice flour a href http www amazon com gp product b000eyc096 thai rice flour 16 oz a , you know that rice flour does not need to be this unpleasantly gritty br br i tried compensating for the grit by using bisquick gluten free to make johnny cakes since the cornmeal is sort of gritty but sadly , after you chew you are still left with this unpleasant grit like fine sand in your mouth . 
i made the waffles and was not impressed br definitely not worth the expense ! br br it 's only redeeming quality was that i seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops br i would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch . 
thought i had died and gone to heaven when i made the bisquit recipe i was wrong ! went to indigestion hell i had serious hope for this product i truley loved the mix , but it did n't love me i have n't had indigestion since i gave up gluten until i ate a bisquit from this mix best luck on getting it right bisquick . 
i will first say that i have only tried making pancakes with gf bisquick my family 's experience with these pancakes , however , was very disappointing , and i will not be trying any other recipe i have tried betty crocker 's gf brownies , and loved them , so when i decided to spend a little extra and try gf bisquick i was greatly let down by the result we could n't even finish them , we just threw them out if you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products , i recommend trying pamela 's pancake mix otherwise , if you are looking for great gf pancakes , look elsewhere gf bisquick is not worth it , in our opinion . 
my personal preference is to stay clear of this i did not like the smell or taste i was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time on my second attempt it came out better , but i did not like the taste of it if i at least liked the taste , i would buy again and make my crust very thin . 
i bought these for pancakes , and i have n't used it to make any other recipes , so i cannot speak for how it makes biscuits , or any other item but for pancakes , it 's a no go they have a hint of pancake flavor with lots of butter syrup but i do n't like smoothering my pancakes in fattening syrup , so these pancakes are not for me moving on to other mixes . 
the only complaint i have about the product is the price and i wish it were organic as well other than that it 's a great , versatile mix i 've used it for pancakes and cherry cobbler \) . 
when i saw the ingredients on this box i knew it would be a disappointment it would be much better and pretty easy just to make your own mix also , there are plenty of other quality mixes out there like pamela 's and bob 's red mill this will be a huge disappointment to you so do n't waste your money . 
reading other reviews , i was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be gluten free dairy free technically , the dry mix is gf df but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk technically i can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then i could already do this with so many other mixes i 've found that mixes that request eggs and or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes the best gf df mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and or oil or other non dairy ingredients in this case , i will return to my old favorite mixes by the cravings place these are truely targeted for a gf df lifestyle that said , if you are not df then perhaps this is a fine choice it would have been better to have a print picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great df option . 
these pancakes are gross they are pale and do not taste like pancakes i bought these based on the reviews because the maple grove farms pancakes were out of stock that week i expected a lot more from bisquick i mean , when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat if you leave them in a little longer to get some color , they just get hard and taste worse i hate wasting food so i forced myself to finish the 3 boxes but i dont think i 'll buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock the only reason i gave these 2 stars is because they are gluten free other than that they 're awful i'm so glad i 've got my maple groves back this week and that these are out of my pantry ! . 
was awful the sight of this in my pan made me sick smells like potato duh potato starch \) would not brown my child laughed the entire time as i complained because i was so hungry and thought i could have a late night pancake session totally not the case yes , i am a gf newbie i tossed the box ! . 
pure toxic garbage eat poison if you want to toxic metals go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison look at all the high ratings apparently people love eating toxic metals not harmful \? would you eat sodium mercury phosphate \? enjoy your metals . 
a great idea that falls short bisquick gluten free still uses an aluminum based baking powder that is toxic to humans aluminum lodges in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in autistic individuals the company refuses to respond to customer inquiries concerning this i cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed . 
i actually was delighted to find this product , and my family and i loved the recipes made with it however it has sugar as the 2nd ingredient and worse it has aluminum in it why would i intentionally feed my family something neuro toxic when i am trying to avoid gluten to keep healthy \? i sure wish those companies who jump on the gf bandwagon would keep health in the equation my kids bowel movements are gluten free too , but i would n't serve it to them for breakfast just sayin . 
i love this mix my favorite of any i 've tried the only reason i starred it at 3 is because this is not a deal i can get 3 boxes at walmart for less than 12 dollars but i have heard of some places seriously over pricing it in other states so ymmv . 
i am thorougly disgusted with betty crocker for this product \( gluten free bisquick \) , which is a shame , because i do applaud them for their excellent cake , cookie , and brownie mixes br br i'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten free baking mix , but for br br 1 \) marketing it as though it 's an equivalent to bisquick and br 2 \) for pricing it so ridiculously high br br ingredients for regular bisquick enriched flour , partiallly hydrogenated soybean and or cottonseed oil , leavening , dextrose , salt br br ingredients for gluten free bisquick rice flour , sugar , leavening \( baking soda , sodium aluminum phosphate , monocalcium phosphate \) , modified potato starch , salt , xanthan gum br br notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten free bisquick \? yup , that 's right there 's no shortening \( or oil \) br br that was the whole point of the original bisquick a baking mix that already had the shortening mixed in that avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits that is why people buy baking mixes for that specific convenience br br betty crocker has decided to leave out the shortening \( or oil \) altogether , even though shortening \( or oil \) is always naturally gluten free so they ca n't pretend it 's a safety for celiacs factor it 's a cost savings to them , pure and simple br br here 's the breakdown of what you 're paying 5 a pound for br rice flour \( 99 cents a pound at my local asian store \) , br sugar \( 2 88 for a 5 pound bag at walmart \) , br potato starch \( also 99 cents a pound at the asian store \) , br baking powder \( 3 19 a pound at emergency essentials \) , br salt \( 2 for 26 ounces of morton 's \) , br xanthan gum \( 10 45 for 4 ounce on amazon \) br br yes , xanthan gum is expensive but very , very little is needed a 16 ounce box of gluten free bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum br br betty crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their mix at home , while eliminating the major convenience factor \( and cost to themselves , but not to you \) of their regular baking mix br br i do n't mind their making a fair profit , especially if the product really were the equivalent of regular bisquick but they 're gouging us , and being misleading about the product br br make your own , easily , and for less than 20 of what they charge ! br br since there 's no oil in gluten free bisquick , you can easily stir up an equivalent , make 5 pounds \( or more ! \) at a time , with very little effort , and it will keep for several months br br or , if you want a real bisquick substitutes , betterbatter org has a recipe on the site for a cup for cup substitute for bisquick that does use shortening and non fat dry milk powder or you can use buttermilk powder , or even vance 's dairy free powder it makes 10 cups at a time , stores well , and you do n't have to use their gluten free flour you can use any gluten free flour replacement you want \( like rice flour and potato starch from your local asian store , mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum , about 1 2 teaspoon for every two cups \) br br to find the recipe , do a google search of betterbatter bisquick substitute master mix br br boo on betty crocker . 
having recently been placed on a gluten free regime , i felt i needed some quick and easy help to get me started it works great but is way too expensive for what it is there were just over three cups of bisquick in the box when i read the ingredients , i realized i could quickly mix up my own quick bread flour and keep it in the fridge i'm glad i tried this item because it taught me that i could do just as well on my own and save a great deal of money . 
i regularly purchase this item in the bulk and loved it because it was also dairy free br however , my last purchase was disappointing , after opening a brand new package i noticed a black thing in the mix , carefully removed to find out it was a dead flour beetle ! i sifted the mix and found more dead bugs ! br br this is the second time i writing this review amazon did n't publish my first review thank you amazon br i will not be purchasing this item again . 
i have been gluten free since 2003 and this is i think the worst tasting gf mix i have come across i have found all to have their own pros and cons but this one have very little to brag about i appreciate the effort anyone puts into a gf product but i could n't buy this one again it was like eating reconstituted potatoes that lookes like pancakes no butter or gravy , just dehydrated spuds the only real good thing to speak of was the texture it was light and moist but i would have to seriously alter the recipe to add flavor . 
now if you could just make it sugar free also \? i know , i do n't want for much \) a href http www amazon com gp product b004391dk0 bisquick pancake and baking mix , gluten free , 16 ounce boxes \( pack of 3 \) a . 
this mix does have that grainy texture found with a lot of rice based gluten free mixes the mix works well when the directions are followed and it is fairly versatile br br i will use the mix i have , but i'm not sure if this will be a staple in my pantry i'm not finding myself reaching for it on a regular basis , which is usually a sign that this is n't a hit in my household . 
i bought this immediately after finding out i could no longer have gluten from everything i was reading it seemed daunting to mix different flours to make anything br br the boxes are small ! while this mix is okay for making pancakes , the biscuits are alright , and to use it as a coating chicken fingers is 'eh' , i'm glad i bought it when i was first diagnosed it helped ease my transition into gluten free cooking and baking br br now that i know what i'm doing , i will not buy again it 's much cheaper to make my own flour mixes at home and use those to make pancakes , biscuits , and breaking for chicken fingers and my own mix tastes much better but , if you are new to gluten free , definetly pick this up , it will help with the transition ! . 
i read lots of good reviews and loved the idea of the convenience of this mix for pancakes and waffles so i whipped up some pancakes , breakfast for dinner style i'm newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to gf , so perhaps i should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before i start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods i used to love , but i swear i cried a little bit when i ate these pancakes because i thought they sucked , frankly they are completely bland and have no flavor at all , and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste \( i do n't know if that 's gluten free but if so it 's probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it ! \) after letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit , it was more like kindergarten paste , but still totally flavorless my 2 year old daughter gobbled them up , so that 's something then i cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that i guess i 'll never get to teach her how to make a real , delicious fluffy wheat pancake , but that 's a whole other thing br br i'm giving it 2 stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken , but you could do that more economically with another gf flour . 
the pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores it is not available in all stores , but i have found it conveniently enough for my purposes . 
i am giving this two stars as my family didnt mind the taste but the texture was so grainy and the biscuts fell apart easily i was not a fan of the pancakes at all i believe they really didnt have a good flavor will not be wasting my money on such a tiny package either when you can but a bigger package of regular mix for less \? not fair to us with allergies in my opinion ! ! . 
the bisquick gluten free was okay , but inferior to the bob 's red mill and hodgson mill products pancake batter , when made according to directions , was watery , resulting in flat pancakes . 
alittle bit expensive for the product i think that it should be the same price as the non gluten bisquick , and otherwise it 's good . 
going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optional and definitely not recommended i knew something was amiss when i opened the product and it was the consistency of very fine white beach sand putting my reservations aside , i proceeded to make pizza dough as directed on the box needless to say , the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange i would not recommmend this product for pizza dough . 
bisquick gf is easy to use pancakes and muffins are very br tasty the product is quick and easy to use it makes my day gram . 
my parents fell in love with 'san francisco bay coffee company' coffee , which use to be available at our local az costco for christmas i looked every where for this coffee found what i thought was a great value on amazon when i bought it \( 12 21 11 \) there was no image available , should have been my first warning sign they had lots of pictures of the 12oz bags of coffee from the san francisco bay coffee co , but i wanted something bigger , and this was 2 lbs now there is a picture availble , but if you look closely it 's roger 's family company coffee , who is technically located near the san francisco bay area so if you 're in love with san francisco bay coffee company , do n't buy this coffee but on the upside , since i waited till the last minute to buy it , i gave it to my parents for christmas anyway explained what happened , but they said the coffee was pretty decent so still makes a nice cup of coffee , just not san francisco bay coffee company coffee . 
these sticks definitely do n't look like ones in the picture br they are much thinner and imho not worth the money i should have returned it but instead gave my dog \( gsd \) 5 at a time to keep her busy br br i 'd stick with the redbarn or equivalent from another website . 
i just received my order of 100 count regular bully sticks and am extremely disappointed br only valuepetsupplies bulk bully sticks are hand measured for consistent thickness i beg to differ br the regular size is quoted as 9 16 thickness the product i received is less than 4 16 in thickness br out of 100 pieces , less than five actually measured up to the regular thickness advertised br my blue heeler dispatched one piece in less than a minute it usually takes him five minutes br br on the other hand , my toy fox terrier is still working on hers and wo n't leave leftovers for the big guy to clean up br while i understand that valuepetsupplies com sponsors good causes , i will be spending an extra 15 cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat . 
i have two medium sized dogs , and these are a real bargain , but only keep them busy for about 15 minutes next time i will get the larger size . 
i ordered these despite my concerns after reading other reviews re small diameter size absolutely true , and i regret making the purchase for the same price , i briefly ordered from a different amazon vendor the same and length bully sticks for the same price difference \? original vendor bully sticks were on average 3 4 thick this vendor bully sticks are at most 1 2 thick , with most closer to 1 4 br br what difference does it make \? br br our dog , a slender 44 lb mixed boxer chow , would take 3 5 days to get through a 3 4 bully stick , and would get hours and hours of good gnawing time in on each one these new thin ones she completely consumes in less than 30 mins that makes a huge difference in how fast we go through the bag ! br br will not order again from this supplier . 
apparently 'regular' size thinner than standard sized pencils \( my chihuahuas finish these in a matter of minutes , when it normally takes them days to consume a thicker bully stick . 
the ghastly horror of these pickles is enough to strip the mind of reason they are brown , mushy , and flavored with spices that bring to mind the morgue and the taxidermist on top of that each and every pickled chunk is sweetened with a full tablespoon of pure cane sugar br br no living human being could consume more than one without selling his immortal soul . 
i have used this mix for years for yellow pound cake and everyone seems to love it i'm still able to purchase the 18oz at my local grocery i was going to order this product , but saw that it was 16 5 oz and was afraid it would n't go with the old duncan hines pound cake recipe hope these companies realize the damage they are doing to time proven recipes when they downsize their products . 
in the past i was able to make so many different cakes using this cake mix i made 2 rum cakes today thinking i had done something wrong when the first one did n't turn out as usual i now realize i did n't do anything wrong , duncan hines did something wrong by reducing the size of their product i would gladly have paid more for the larger mix now i will never buy another dunkin hines mix ! ! ! ! ! how dumb do you think we are . 
duncan hines used to be my favorite line of cake mixes i bought them all of the time but now they , like betty crocker , have downsized their packages of cake mix these new mixes will not work with older recipes , that called for the 18 25 ounce size of cake mix that rules out a lot of our favorite cakes even a plain cake will be changed it wo n't bake up as high or as big in the pan duncan hines just lost me as a customer br br pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes \( at least , not yet \) i will be buying them if they shrink in size , i will bake from scratch . 
while i think this product is good , i'm disappointed that they reduced the weight of the product from 18 25 oz to 16 25 oz has anyone else noticed how difficult it is to read the type used for the weight , the 6 looks very much like an 8 same size box , less product , hmmmm . 
i have bought duncan hines yellow cake mix in the past and have made a favorite recipe with it in the past , it had 18 25 ounces pillsbury and betty crocker have the required ounces 18 i bought duncan hines at safeway because it was less expensive than the other brands and after i got home , i discovered why i will not buy duncan hines again unless they go back to the 18 ounces or go to 9 ounces for 54 consumer beware and read the number of ounces in the product . 
maybe , i got a bad one it 's very plain , nothing special in flavor i felt like i wasted my time and money i will not buy this flavor again . 
i made one for my daughter 's birthday party and everyone but her died of uranium poisoning still tasted pretty good , though . 
i found the candy to be harder than i had expected it came in bar form and it is rather hard to chew but just as tasty just takes more chewing to enjoy ! ! . 
while i love bit a honey and do n't regret my purchase , i did not find them as fresh and soft as the other reviewers they arrived hard and brittle but still taste wonderful if you can eat them without breaking your teeth maybe it 's because i bought the bags of individually wrapped bit a honey 's as opposed to the actual candy bars next time it 's the bars ! . 
berries are find , but the package is bad unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor . 
the food and drug administration \( fda \) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs \( also sold as chicken tenders , strips or treats \) may be associated with illness in dogs in the last 12 months , fda has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from china these complaints have been reported to fda by dog owners and veterinarians . 
be advised you will only receive 1 \( one \) box they are less than 3 00 in the local grocery store will not purchase again . 
this product was absolutely horrible ! each and every bar was obviously old , because it was stale , smelled awful , and had to be thrown out shame one you for even trying to sell such a product ! . 
four of the eleven glass vials arrived broken the product is apparently not able to be returned , so i just wasted 55 dollars . 
one of the vials was broken when we received this product but you ca n't return the product or get a refund what a rip off . 
while the flavor and quality of this chili is great , the 108 ounce can is mostly liquid the number of servings is listed as 12 , but the reality is that it will only serve about 5 , unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated i wo n't be purchasing this again . 
b u r n e d br br i read the other two reviews and did n't heed their warning that 's on me br br they are 'usable' but they were certainly burned . 
i ca n't believe i wasted almost 20 on this they were burned ! they were inedible ! it was so nasty and they took forever to arrive ! br you should take this product off of your product list worst product i 've ever ordered . 
i purchased 6 boxes as gifts at 21 per box i spent over 120 00 and none could be used every piece was broken and could not be used for the seder sending a gift that is broken and ca n't be used is very embarrassing also the return window is april 18th which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first seder which was on april 18th at night . 
this is the first time we bought this tea from amazon , we used to get it directly from revolution tea i do n't know if that made any difference , or if it was just a change in the tea 's composition \( along with the packaging \) , but what used to be my wife 's favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste , with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong , almost cheap generic green tea flavor really disappointing , especially since we 're stuck with six boxes . 
the flavor is very mild we tried brewing longer and using cooler water temp but the flavor is almost nonexistant would not purchase again . 
trader joe 's pomegranate white tea is superior to this tea this is very bitter and perfumey maybe thats what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems i found it repulsive . 
i'm not a coffee expert , but i know a good tasting coffee when i drink a cup the melitta riviera is a light roast , with a nutty and creamy flavor the aroma is just exhilarating it left a nice aroma throughout the house , almost made it seem like i was in a coffee shop unfortunately , it is just decaffeinated and did not give me the jolt i need in the morning br br the packaging caused some problems for me the seal is excessively tight i 've never had this problem with starbucks , dunkin donuts , peet 's coffee , or meijer packs with the melitta , it was so tight that when i did open it , the bag tore apart and spilled a lot of the ground coffee onto my kitchen top and floor one could argue that this tight seal packs in all the flavor , i could argue that if it were easier to open i would n't have spilled maybe 3 days worth of coffee grounds onto the floor br br pros light roast , excellent aroma , nutty and creamy taste br br cons decaf \( arggghhh \) and hard to open pack br br overall 3 5 . 
i have a pretty wide appreciation for acceptable coffee , but in my opinion , this stuff is mediocre coffee i drink both regular and decaf on a daily basis and to me , this tasted like institutional cafeteria coffee i am normally a fan of the swiss water decaffeination process decaf coffees , and was disappointed by the quality of this gourmet coffee br br with that said , i did try this twice to give it a fair review the first time i prepared it the same way i normally make my coffee \( on the strong side \) , the second time i followed the directions exactly both times using filtered water and a quality coffee maker that uses the melitta style \( cone \) filter to my taste , it was stale and over ground \( like the flavor was watered out of it and then over roasted and ground extra fine to try and put some flavor back into it \) , comparable in quality to low end bulk coffee the brands of decaf coffee i do like and brew at home \( dunkin' and newman 's own , to name only two \) are in the same price range , and also purchased pre ground , but to me taste much smoother , and more full flavored this coffee is not one i would make a point to purchase when there are better coffee choices for the same money or cheaper coffee choices for the same quality . 
the price is great but i just did n't like the taste of this coffee i'm pretty picky about coffee and love to drink strong this one produce very acidic coffee when made strong , but if you make it thin , then it tastes okay with just slight acidic after taste how you 'd like this coffee is really depending on your personal taste of coffee , but if you are like me , drink coffee strong , or dislike acidic after taste that lasts while , then this is not for you . 
i thought this would be a great decaf option , but the flavor is a lot milder than expected i use a bit more than the recommended amount to coax more intense flavor a bit better than instant for late night sippers like me . 
i remembered that melitta was a very fine ground , and thought it would likely go well in my coffee maker br br but after having a bag of whole beans and grinding it myself , the melitta came up average at best better than maxwell house though . 
this ground decaffeinated coffee makes a fine brew with a rich aroma and flavor it is smooth and satisfying with a full bodied taste my wife and i loved the taste and aroma of this ground coffee for an ideal cup measure one heaping teaspoon full of coffee per cup of hot water you could change the quantity depending on the strength of the coffee you desire i generally drink decaffeinated folgers 's brand , and when i compared the two brands , i did not find a great deal of difference in the richness of coffee you may want to consider the price variance between the two brands before you want to purchase this product . 
not much of a decaf drinker \( unless i am craving a cup late night for some reason \) i have to say , this coffee tasted average at best i am a wawa coffee fan , and coming from them to this well it missed the mark i gave some to my mother in law and she seemed happy with it , so 3 stars in that respect i might try mixing it with my non decaf coffee to see how it tastes , but i am not holding my breath if the price was a few cheaper , definitely would bump it up a star . 
if you are truly looking for a decaf that will no longer make your heart race , this is not the coffee for you it is quite flavorful , so i do recommend it to those who can still tolerate a bit of kick in their coffee . 
like most melitta brews , i found this one to be somewhat middle of the road it 's certainly not undrinkable , but it 's not the first one i 'd reach for , either as many of the other reviewers mentioned , i did find it nearly undrinkable when brewed in the quantity shown i think you have to at least double the amount you use to get a good cup , so take that into consideration when figuring the value br br i'm a little sensitive to caffeine and like to have a decaf on hand for drinking later in the day , and i bought this primarily to use with my mr coffee frappe maker \( a href http www amazon com gp product b002fwmf8g mr coffee bvmc fm1 20 ounce frappe maker a let me just put in a quick pitch for that , i love it ! \) i found the riviera sunset stood up well to all the milk , flavoring , and ice inherent in making a frappe \( again , with a significant increase in the amount used \) br br i would probably not purchase this coffee just because of my own views on coffee i look for bird friendly , fair trade brands , and i find nothing to indicate that melitta makes any effort to meet these expectations leaving aside these considerations , though , i think those who enjoy a somewhat light , easy drinking brew would like this coffee . 
okay , i'm a complete coffee nut i 've even been known to grow my own beans , and when i run out of my private label , i tend to enjoy the baddest kona or jamaican blue mountain i can find br br still , sometimes i just want a quick cup of respectable coffee without all the fuss , and this is what i was hoping for in the melitta riviera decaf to a good degree , i was happy with it , but it 's certainly not something i 'd curl up with when in the mood for a really outstanding cup of coffee br br the positives are the aroma , the uniformity of the grind and the overall taste , which i 'd rate as fairly mild and maybe a slight bit on the acid side i found i liked it best either in a french press or in my viviano espresso maker two techniques that make the most out of somewhat weak coffee brewed conventionally , i found i could compensate by using somewhat more coffee than usual br br still , although not a serious competitor to the world 's best coffees , it does n't cost 50 a pound , either i 'd have to say that for the price , it 's definitely worth trying . 
i'm not sure what all the fuss is about \? \? \? i thought it was a good coffee but not better than the store brand i usually buy and beings the store brand is much cheaper i 'll stick with it it is n't bad coffee but i just do n't seeing it being any better . 
this makes a good pot of decaf nothing remarkable we have served this to many guests to no comments nobody asked us what it was , but nobody spit it out , either \) it is smooth and not too strong , which is our preference we would n't hesitate to buy it again , but would n't go out of our way either . 
the coffee is good but it is nothing special compared to maxwelhouse decafe this is nearly the same just slightly better i do n't feel it is worth the extra cash to buy this instead of a cheaper variety available anywhere i did enjoy the coffee but i probably wo n't buy it again unless it would be deeply discounted . 
first of all , when i opened my bag of melitta decaf , it did n't have that strong , amazing rich coffee smell that my usual coffee has i brewed up a pot in my drip coffeemaker , and while it was ok , there was nothing outstanding about the taste it was bland and unremarkable compared to the coffee i normally drink . 
the aroma of a href http www amazon com gp product b002tmv3e4 melitta cafe collection riviera sunset decaffeinated ground coffee , 10 ounce bags \) a was fairly weak scent , after all , is a huge part of taste , and this was disappointing br br even though i added more coffee grinds than the directions instructed , i found the coffee to be a bit bland the taste was more than flavored water , but not amazingly so , with no subtle overtones it was n't bitter , but it was n't much of anything br br while i generally drink hi test as opposed to decaffeinated , i do drink decaf at least twice a week the a href http www amazon com gp product b002tmv3e4 melitta a was comparable to the generic brand that i usually have br br a href http www amazon com gp product b002tmv3e4 melitta cafe collection riviera sunset decaf a is n't a bad coffee , but it 's not worth the money if there are other options available . 
decaffeinated coffee is for most an oxymoron , for others an afterthought it possesses few spots on grocery shelves and has shared little in the gourmet coffee line which changed how people accept this ancient drink into their lives comedian bob irwin even compared the blend to kissing your sister the day 's first cup comes with a sense of entitlement subsequent cups transition through the day \( work , afternoon , dessert \) , while wanting both coffee 's jolt and cozy sociability \( instant \? do n't get me started ! \) br that 's why this new melitta riviera sunset gourmet coffee is a pleasant surprise it carries a full , almost nutty flavor without the bitter bite of the coffee which , for many , defines their image of coffee and its lifestyle \( this is n't surprising since melitta 's ad copy references the breezy feel of european cafes , a far cry from the irked lines at the morning coffee shop \) br no less than henry ward beecher once said no coffee can be good in the mouth that does not first send a sweet offering of odor to the nostrils riviera sunset invites with its scent upon opening and does n't disappoint when poured \( hold to the preparation instructions yours truly made one cup a little too strong and it came across a bit acidic \) its taste , not its caffeine jolt , is your wake up call recommended as a tastier , if somwhat pricier , alternative to major brands . 
some reviewers say the coffee is bitter i like bitter but i did n't like this it was n't a good bitter taste , it was a cringe kind of taste br br i drink one of the strongest coffee 's out there and this was too much for me the strange taste of it turned me off br i once owned a coffee pot by melitta too , and it took a cone shaped special filter i was n't impressed with that either br br maybe i'm just not big on arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me not smooth bitter yes , but not smooth br br it smells ok i agree with charlie \( another amazon reviewer \) who said the package was difficult to open it was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open , the bag tore apart br br no way would i spend 20 bucks for this if i was addicted to it , possibly , but even then that 's steep and i surely wo n't buy this in the future br br you can go down to the local name of popular coffee shop here and get 2 bags for this price of freshly ground coffee br br melitta makes it sound like it 's the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package gourmet , swiss water process , from europe 's charming sidewalk cafe 's , top quality hand picked beans br br if you want to pay this kind of money and like melitta coffee , then get it , but i do n't think it 's anything special . 
i'm not a coffee snob i can tell that there is a difference between kenyan and columbian , but i ca n't tell you which is which without a label this decaf tastes good i like mine with lots of fake sugar and cream the coffee flavor is n't subdued by these additions the bag ultimately required scissors to open the blurb for this says \( pack of 3 \) i only got one bag not sure why that is it 's happened before with other products would i buy this again \? sure , if it was on sale that 's how i buy my coffee most of the time . 
first off , i received a bag of this coffee via the vine program to review at no cost secondly , i am more of a bold , slap me in the face french roast coffee drinker \( or starbucks gold coast \) , so i had my reservations about this decaf br br and well , for me , this coffee had a somewhat stale aroma upon opening the package , an ok flavor once brewed \( sort of a nutty strange flavor at first \) , and once consumed , left an after taste in my mouth br br it is definitely a different roast than i am used to , but it is decent for a pre ground melita decaf more of a medium roast as opposed to being a dark bold roast in my opinion overall not too bad br br i give this coffee a so so recommendation . 
i usually enjoy a cup of coffee a few days a week , more as an indulgence than as a necessity it 's a sipping beverage for me , and flavor matters a lot that said , i add milk and sugar , so i'm not excessively picky \( or i think so , at least \) so i'm always glad to find new gourmet blends to add to my list of favorites br br this blend seemed promising , with a very nice aroma and a perfect , even grind i usually grind my own beans , but found that this grind worked nicely in my espresso machine as is it even produced a rich , smooth crema unfortunately , my first sip without sugar or milk was very bitter i ended up adding about a half teaspoon more sugar than i usually use just to compensate even then , the coffee flavor , itself , was thin and weak with just a little milk added , it tasted more like , well , flavored milk br br this coffee reminded me of the inoffensive bland coffee my parents used to get for our drip coffee maker a couple of decades ago fine for that application , but not really what i'm looking for in rich , smooth flavor with low bitterness . 
this coffee tastes better than folgers that 's not much of an endorsement , but since folgers is about all i ever drink , it 's my only point of comparison i would recommend you do n't try the stupid and counterproductive experiment of replacing your usual caffeinated stuff with a cup of this some saturday morning , as doing so will only result in one of those headaches it takes three over the counter painkillers to get rid of and in the meantime , while you 're trying to fight off the headache , you 'll be completely unable to make headway with that craptastic novel you just got from amazon , which was reinforcing all your worst opinions of the romantic fantasy subgenre before you had to lie down and commence clutching your forehead . 
normally i would not purchase coffee online as i have several coffee shops within a reasonable distance i saw this and figured why not \? br br this coffee was vacuumed sealed and was tight enough to where i had to use scissors to open it one thing i tend to avoid is pre ground coffee i usually like to grind my own beans as i find the taste is better br br the smell from the bag was for a lack of better words pretty basic usually , there is a distinct smell depending on the bean and there can be faint traces of something there was n't anything distinct about this coffee br br i used a standard drip maker which in itself was probably not the best choice but i suspect it would not matter as i was surprised that there really is n't a strong smell coming from the cup of coffee which i drank black br br the taste was kind of bland i did try a little piece of chocolate and it did seem to help br br overall it 's an ok coffee if you are not an aficionado however , it 's not something i would add to my list of brands i purchase . 
the initial aroma upon opening the package was decent , though subtle unfortunately , it quickly dissipated i really could n't smell anything after a minute , which i assume is due to it being pre ground br br i brewed this coffee in a french press as well as in a drip brewer both results tasted flat and boring , although there was a decent amount of body at least it was inoffensive perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee for about the same price , you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store . 
i am amazed at the consistent flavor of melitta coffees seriously , i sip any melitta coffee and can identify it immediately as they all taste the same not bad coffee , always a darker roast and a deep flavor , but always the same no matter what flavor is printed on the package the riviera sunset makes a nice rich cup of decaf coffee , perfect for an after dinner treat . 
melitta cafe 's riviera sunset coffee is n't bad , it just sadly is n't all that great either it is not something i would buy again , mainly because i 'll probably forget about it . 
i 've read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as coffee tasting or with roasted flavors , but to be very truthful , it tastes just the way i could imagine second hand smoke would it 's very very strong , requires 15 minutes to steep , and is not for the faint hearted i 've heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product , but i was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits good luck to those who care to brave this roasted flavor . 
this is part of dr oz 's tea diet works like a charm i have lost inches already and i have been on it for 4 days . 
this was the worst tasting tea , actually the worst tasting anything , that i have ever consumed i took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup it tasted like dirt , which makes sense since it is a root the rest of the tea bags are going in the trash . 
first , let me state that i brew most of my tea in a gaiwan , hence , i use loose leaf tea br br white tea is one of my favorites so i'm always on the lookout for a nicely priced bai mudan br br as much as i love bai hao yinzhen , i just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea i drink br br i thought this was a pretty good price and when i opened it up it did n't look too bad either much to my surprise , after taking the first layer off the top \( i transfer my tea to good tea tins \) it was nearly all powder dust with hardly any intact leaves this is extremely problematic if you do n't use any filters or screens \( like me \) i do n't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you do n't pour through a screen , however , this was so broken up that it was just unworkable br br i have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point i most likely wo n't be ordering it again br br that being said , the whole leaves that were there \( on the top \) looked fine it does have a bit of a green tea taste \( vs some other high quality white tea i am used to \) , however , it is n't bad or anything definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag was n't mostly powder br br i took a couple pics so i will post them keep in mind this came in two pouches , i poured into tins and that is where i took the pictures \( the product does not actually come in tins \) . 
i also bought two of these as gifts , and will be returning them for the same reason as some of the others unacceptable packaging ! unless you have already tried the product , there is nothing about this that makes you want to try it i assumed \( big mistake ! \) that there would be some kind of packaging , but there was not this is really sad too , because the product is great . 
i purchased this as a present but it does n't come as shown in the picture it is little white bags with the flavor written on them someone receiving it as a gift would n't even know what it was unless i explained it to them will be returning . 
i bought this for a christmas gift , but i will be returning there is no box or packaging as pictured , it is just 5 white baggies containing the mixes , which would be fine if i was just buying for myself but not for a gift . 
i ordered in order to get variety of flavored coffees , and have to admit disappointed in the selection several duplicates of ordinary coffees received also 2 of the flavors advertised which were my primary reason for ordering were not included . 
i was very excited to recieve my shipment today then to be disapppointed because 2 of the flavors that i was told would be in the package were not there ! i really wanted to try creme brulee and raspberry chocolate truffle ! i am looking forward to trying the others but had i know i would not receive these flavors i would not have ordered this product ! i also did not recieve the pink ribbon flavor ! . 
pkg says soy free ingredients \( and my stomach bladder \) say otherwise ! br also , lots of fiber in this one if you can handle fiber \( and soy \) this food will fill you up like crazy if you have ibs and have trouble with fiber , or are eating a low residue diet be careful br i'm going back to the bread eating a sandwich on it grilled is a fair substitute for the dreaded wheat . 
the ener g english muffins that i received from amazon were not of the same quality when i buy them directly from the distributor in seattle they crumbled and had dense places that were not really edible also , there were only 4 in the pack instead of 6 i had to cancel my recurring order . 
the ener g foods english muffins look good in the packaging , but something in them makes them mushy on the bottom this presents a gooy feel in the mouth , and both my husband and i got stomach aches wo n't be buying this again . 
these english muffins are okay at best they are very hard to cut and break apart easily making it hard to toast they definitely have to have something like jelly or peanut butter spread on them otherwise , do not taste the best . 
if you are looking for english muffins go to the grocery store and buy them these do not even resemble english muffins and are tasteless however , if you are on a restricted diet \( wheat flour , soy , dairy , gluten , etc \) these might be for you check the list of ingredients i did n't care for them at all . 
i tried these for a substitute for a sandwich roll , i could n't cut them without falling apart ! i ended up toasting them in pieces , more like chunks , and with enough cream cheese , they were only ok ! tapioca hamburger rolls are the only products i would recommend ! . 
these are not the greatest thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come not so they were not what i had expected . 
come on amazon , give me a break powdered tofu \? get in some real food and i 'll buy more from you i went looking for table sugar you 've got 100 weird kinds of sugar \( that you expect me to buy in bulk ! \) but no just plain sugar i'm not eatin' any more of this rice and tofu bread either br br sorry i just had to rant . 
berries are find , but the package is bad unable to open neatly and then it rips open and your berries are all over the floor . 
i 've been sampling as many sugar free chocolates as i can find this one was okay but not the best i do n't think what i got was the freshest either , as it had some of that white coating on a portion of the bar the best i 've found so far is cavalier brand at another website . 
do not buy ! review online ! looks like another treat made in china with multiple reports of suspected poisoning ! ! ! please only buy treats made in the usa ! . 
don't you know that sugar is the sand of time \? since the ingredients of kavli crispy thin were listed on amazon , and the time i received my order , sugar was added to this product you are going to get in trouble , mister . 
this tea has no flavor , tastes like dust it looks like quality pretty package but it 's no good lipton regular pekoe is farrr superior . 
i keep these in the freezer when unexpected guests drop in , or if one of the staff has guests what we do prefer is to slaughter the fatted calf , but that is not always practical due to anticipating aging times having just said that , i realize that i must institute a detailed and precise slaughtering schedule to insure always having quality beef on hand br br i may have given these kobe steaks four stars if that were my only gripe , but i have a problem with the size first off , these cuts are only one inch thick , which is ghastly offensive i steak should be , at the bare minimum , two inches thick i do not even associate with proletarians , and can only imagine the horrors that these people committ against decent food ca n't these people just eat sensibly , or not at all please do n't get me started , for i wanted to include sterility drugs in all fast food , particularly the bargain menu , but that is merely a hope and dream for another day br br secondly , is n't there a law somewhere about a steak less that two pounds \? my heavens , this fourteen ouncer is a mere sampler , a tease i suppose these cuts are intended to be given away at those offensive stores that the yuppies flock to as lemmings to a cliff br br lastly , i must close this review before i become too distraught . 
kobe beef comes from a specific prefecture in japan and is illegal to import in to the united states in fact , it has been illegal to import since 2010 in any form this is just overpriced regular american beef . 
the set is bigger than i thought it would be it would take a very big cake to set up all of this i ended up using only the golfer and a ball the golfer is about 3 inches tall and the clubs are 3 4 inches long . 
my dog is a finicky eater when it comes to canned food after trying many varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store , the alpo chicken in gravy is all he will eat \( i can sometimes feed him the t bone steak flavor \) i guess it looks and tastes more like people food than the other varieties my only complaint is that when i received the shipment \( pack of 24 \) , almost all of the cans were dented , and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can one can leaked out the dent was at the seal on the top normally , i'm not someone who is picky about dented cans , but this was a little much a couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when i opened them so , i guess i 'll go back to buying at the grocery store just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than lugging them home from the store oh well . 
my dogs love this food ! no allergies , more energy and nicer coats my big dogs skin does n't seem nearly as irritated and i am assuming with a little more use his skin will be normal again we like it m2 ofore than any other i have seen my only problem is that i have 2 dogs one huge one and 12 5lbs hardly make it a month we really could use bigger bags or a qty discount plus i cannot find this in any stores so when i ran out i had to by a substitute br update my second shipment did not arrive at all i have been trying to contact buyer but i cannot figure it out had to go back to the old food at least i realize that this food did not help with the dry itchy skin that the dogs have . 
good but not my favorite newman 's own organics adult dog food formula , 7 pound bag i now buy my dogs taste of the wild salmon just great stuff buy it on amazon ! the less fillers the better not meals for my doggies ! . 
i 've been searching for a no corn natural dog food to keep skin rashes away tried halo which was great but so expensive this is a little more affordable and the ingredient list looks very similar to halo , but oh boy i'm just glad it 's warm enough to have the windows open ! my dog loves the taste and the quality seems great , so we 'll try 2 more days to see if things settle down . 
this food might have great contents , but my 7 1 2 lb , 11 2 yr old poodle does n't like the taste she 's not a picky eater . 
based on the great reviews from everyone about their picky dogs loving it and always eating it i figured my picky dog would enjoy it as well the price for the amount is also very good considering it is all organic but sadly my dog hates it she smells it and walks away and when i try to hide the food she finds her way to eat around this food i wont be buying it again but i really wished my dog enjoyed it so i could continue to support this brand . 
i expected newman 's own dog food to be great it may be very nutritious , but my little terriers told me , we are not eating this stuff period no way after 3 days they sniffed their bowls and walked away so i ordered another organic dog food \( natural balance organics \) and it came today so , half old , half new , by the book , and they picked out the new stuff and left the newman 's in the bowl go figure just thought some of you might like to know i am switching them from iams to something much healthier and i finally think i have a match but it 's not newman 's . 
if you are looking for an actual organic dog food , newman 's own is not the way to go i accidently purchased this thinking it was what it claimed on the front package , only to read the ingredient list to find out that basically everything else but the chicken was organic with all of the drugs and hormones fed to conventionally raised food animals this ingredient is the most important one that should be organic . 
i cringed a little after reading the ingredient list way too much grains and not enough quality protein for our dogs notice all of them are at the beginning , which means they make up quite a bit of the diet soy protein is included but some dogs do n't do well with soy \( mine \) and meat should be the protein source in dog food , not grains br not recommended for your furry ones . 
i purchased two bags of this dogfood , after one week of feeding the newman brand , my dog started vomiting after eating , she had gas all the time and lied around whimpering due to stomach ache , after having her checked for a stomach disorder , i took her off the newman dogfood and the symptoms disappeared br i have sent three emails to newman dogfood website , no replies or acknowledgement , phone number not available , the dogfood is expensive and the customer service is non existent . 
i do n't know why this got such good reviews but my yorkshire really does n't like it he likes iams more than this and it 's cheaper . 
i feed my dog royal canine brand which i typically have to mix with chicken stick or wet canned food for her to eat i thought this stuff would be more flavorful and easy to serve upon opening i could tell i made a mistake smells like cardboard my dog wo n't eat it no matter how i dress it up , much less could i get her to eat it plain plus , it has none of the science behind it like higher end brands like royal canine the newman brand is spreading itself too thin here they should stick with pasta sauce . 
i had to pick up a grocery store brand after running out of our regular innova dog food i fed this to my 160lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this brand produced ! he was going up to 10 times a day ! unbelievable ! this just goes to show how much filler is in this food would never recommend . 
this food is organic , sure however , look at the ingredients , top 7 includes chicken meal never feed your pet anything with chicken meal or chicken by product it 's a cheap substitute , and really is bad for the dog i suggest a brand like evo , blue buffalo , ect no ingredient should be meal or by product . 
i guess my animals \( cat and dog \) ca n't read the amous names on bag warpings , as they almost refuse to eat this stuff unless nothing else available and they are hungry . 
i have 4 dogs and all were sick on this food one actually almost died it had to be ressucitated after i spent 4 , 000 00 on vet 's bills i decided to call the fda to analize this food they found ethoxyquin on it a pesticide i just want to make sure if someone out there has the same problem , that it must be known i'm still not happy about this incident i decided not to pursue it any longer , but i still feel people should know these 'organic' companies ca n't get away misleading people if everyone exposed them , then this would be a better world think about it br br a href http www amazon com gp product b000yqmb1g newman 's own organics chicken rice , advanced dry , 25 pound a . 
chicken meal br not legally allowed in human food br br subject to only the less stringent animal food safety standards br may contain 4 d chicken products br diseased chickens br chickens that were dying prior to butchering br chickens that were dead prior to butchering br disabled chickens \( may carry more infections \) br rendered br may contain waste products br restaurant waste br meat processing facility waste br packinghouse waste br not subject to testing for quality standards or nutrient levels , may vary widely from batch to batch . 
the number one ingredient is chicken not organic chicken just the hormone pumped junk you would n't eat yourself i will stick to natural balance which is sold here on amazon as well . 
i will never again even consider a dog food with corn , wheat or soy in it grain has no place in a dog 's diet ! . 
i have to say in the beginning i have not tried this food , it had me sold i said oh boy ! its made by paul newman it has to be good ! this should not be catarized organic ! ! its deceitful it should be advertized as partially organic ! then you wont be upset that the most important thing you want to be organic the meat is not ! who cares if your veggies r organic \? well yeh it helps def but they dont normally raise veggies with antibiotics etc etc ! br so if organic is what ur looking for walk up the aisle to castor and pollux organix dog food ! every single ingrediant is o r g a n i c ! ! ! br shame on you the company of one of my fav actors ! im truly surprised he let this be under the reviews of organic ! . 
we have been using newman 's organic dry dog food for over 5 years it was a godsend when we discovered it our little jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities so we decided to go organic all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the newman 's however after giving glowing reviews for many years , we now have to concede something has changed our little jack 's itching returned to the point of drawing blood it is clear something changed and i believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was we are on the hunt again i am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive this likely is not for you too bad it once was a superior product . 
we 've been feeding this food to our wheaten terrier for a year , with happy results until last tuesday , when my latest subscribe and save bag was opened my dog started throwing up during the night after eating from this new bag on the first night , i figured she 'd eaten something bad off the street on the second night , i figured it was the lingering effects of eating something bad off the street on the third night , i started looking for other causes for the nighttime retching , and i realized that the vomiting had started on the same day as we 'd started the new bag i stopped feeding the dog the newman 's own and the vomiting stopped for 2 nights last night , i fed her the food again , and sure enough , she threw up in the night br br i trusted and liked this food and all things under the newman 's own brand but i 'll never buy their products again they clearly have a dangerous quality control problem . 
i really want to like this product because of the great things newman 's have done and the fact that all the proceeds go to charity i like the fact that the ingredients are all top quality and organic it looks and smells good too unfortunately , none of this matters to my dog daisy she just does n't care for it usually she will sniff it and walk away once she realizes nothing else is coming her way she will usually eat it but i feel bad since she obviously does n't care for it like i said , i really want to like this product , but my dog has the final say sadly , i do n't think i will buy it again . 
both of my dogs had trouble with this formula , allergy wise it took me a couple of days to realize that their itching was related to the food needless to say i wo n't buy this product again . 
when one purchases a product that is called newman 's organics , one would expect organic food not just the vegetables , which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken i was very , very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic for a couple of dollars more , just buy real organic dog food this dog food is n't exactly cheap , so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising this whole greenwashing thing needs to be regulated better if someone uses the word organic in their description , it better be organic otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate newmans has a great reputation , i buy a lot of their products , but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future br br on the positive side , my dog loved it , she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed i have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good , it 's like the crack cocaine of dog food she has never been a finicky eater , she 'll pretty much eat anything voraciously , but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world too bad she is n't getting any more of it . 
i like that this is a reasonably priced organic dog food that is readily available i switched to this when the brand i had been feeding my dogs for years began to upset the tummy of my senior however , neither of my dogs \( even my chowhound \) is crazy about it they eventually did eat it , but it took a lot of coaxing but the tummy problems did clear up . 
as other viewers have pointed out , this dog food contains pesticides and grains , among other questionable ingredients the experience with this brand has been disappointing i appreciate newman 's own brand but i no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them br br i have since switched to blue buffalo , as they seem to have the best reputation br br stacey 's review sold me on it br br dog food has changed alot over the past few years as pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets , larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers this was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients real meat and rice were substituted with meat by product and cheap imported grains \( particularly corn \) that were determined to be unfit for human consumption they are taking ingredients that used to be considered waste and packaging it up as healthy nutritious food for your beloved pet our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food br br blue buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that , at least to my knowledge , has not sold out yet the food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by products , fillers , corn or soy we switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy toxicology verified case of aflatoxin poisoning from the healthy nutritious dog food we were buying and feeding him this was not cheap food folks this was a well known brand , highly marketed as natural , that we were paying 60 bag for the fda analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins , but nothing was done to the dog food manufacturer they are still producing their high priced waste and heavily marketing it as natural br br my advice to pet owners read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often ! blue buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence because it does n't contain any cheap fillers , it 's more satisfying to your dog so you do n't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical do n't wait until it 's too late for your beloved pet . 
i have three dogs two of the three would normally eat just about anything that you put in their bowls the third one \( a yorkie \) , has always been pickey for the past couple years i had been buying those expensive brands of food that promise natural ingredients and better health i decided to try newman 's own none of my dogs seem to be crazy about this food \( no disrespect to the late mr newman \) if i mix newman 's own with another brand , the dogs make an effort to pick out \( eat \) the other food and they will tend to leave newman 's own in the bowl if they are hungry and nothing else is available , they will eat the newman 's own i am not here to knock newman 's own i am simply telling you my experience btw the food is not old it does not smell stale or old . 
this solved my pups dog food allergy problems when i started purchasing it \( i have a husky and a german shepherd \) , but several months ago the itching started again the color and size of the kibble even noticeably changed i wrote a letter of inquiry to newman 's , with batch numbers from the bags , but have received no answer since then , i 've purchased both solid gold wolf king and royal canine 24 german shepherd and the dogs are doing okay again . 
my dog loves this food i really like that it is organic , especially with all the recent problems with other dog foods i will continue to buy this brand in the store i would rate the product as a 5 br br the problem i had was with subscribe and save i started out buying at a very decent price after only 2 months the subscription price had increased by almost 40 ! ! no notice on the increase was sent to see if i still wanted it either i believe amazon should send an alert and ask to confirm or cancel when there is an increase my other subscriptions have not had price increases like this one subscription rating 1 . 
the chicken is not organic it is the main ingredient this is not organic dog food it is marketing lies to fool you into thinking you are paying more for quality ingredients when you are not getting organic chicken . 
i bought a big pack of this gum the flavor \( kiwi watermelon \) is ok , but it did n't last long , i found i would usually pop a new piece in my mouth after about 2 3 minutes to get another shot of flavor i would n't really recommend this gum , it 's not horrible , but not that great either . 
this gum is the worst i have ever purchased , plain and simple within two seconds of chewing taste gone ! . 
tastes very good i really like the taste br br but then it is gone like it was never there so fleeting br br takes two pieces to really enjoy , also br br and be very careful not to eat it seriously , it is hard not to swallow it laugh all you want you try it and see what i mean . 
i 've never had an allergic reaction to any food , or anything else , in my life but within 20 seconds of starting to chew a piece of this gum , my throat began to burn and my airway became constricted that 's strange , because i 've been chewing spearmint and peppermint ice cubes for a while now with no reaction i tasted another piece from another pack \( we get this stuff free at the dining facility here in iraq \) , and again , my throat started burning so , if you have a history of food allergies , you might not want to try this flavor . 
are you kidding me ! 32 00 ! ! ! i buy this all day long at popular wholesale clubs for under 10 00 no more then 15 00 at reqular stores watch these prices guys . 
i absolutely love this stuff , but i pay 2 00 to 2 50 for a 6 pack in the grocery store why is this price so high \? . 
you can get these sooooooooooooo much cheaper at wholesale clubs br br i get the 24 20oz \( yes 20oz ! \) for 11 or 12 ! ! its actually even cheaper then buying the bottles from the regular store ! . 
i hated this coffee i'm much more of a starbucks or peet 's loyalist , so maybe i'm a bit spoiled but after reading many positive reviews of this company i decided to give it a try big mistake i had a hard time giving it away it definitely tastes like chicory blagk bad news . 
i bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat , and with a name like beneful i thought i was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food my dogs did eat this food , but after reading the ingredients i completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs the first three ingredients are ground yellow corn , chicken by product meal , and corn gluten meal how disgusting is that \? ! the main ingredient is a corn filler one thing my vet told me a while back that i never forgot when you eat corn , what comes out of the other end \? the same thing happens with dogs basically , dogs cannot digest corn , it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full , poop out more , and retain less nutrients the only meat in beneful at all is a by product , its not even a real meat ! by products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested we 're talking beaks , chicken feet , eyeballs , even chicken poop ! i would not recommend this product to anyone , for any reason , ever it is an absolutely awful dog food i ca n't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising br br i recommend to stay far away from beneful , and most purina products when purchasing a dog \( or cat \) food , the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself now that i know what to look for , i usually buy my pets all natural , organic foods such as blue buffalo , halo or wellness . 
when i got this it was melted through the package and what was n't completely destroyed was stuck to the inside of the wrappers you would think that if you are going to ship chocolate in the summer time you would pack it in something cold i was n't very happy with it i love the candy and once you peeled it off the insides of the wrappers it was good . 
i thought this would be the perfect candybar , i love hazel nuts , i love caramel , and i love chocolate but there is something about the chocolate filling that i do n't like br they claim a whole hazel nut in each piece , but it 's probably only half it 's an ok candy , but i will never ever buy it again i 'll stick to snickers with almonds ! . 
very weak blend , slightly bitter aftertaste noticeably light brew when brewing wo n't purchase again , in fact , i regret this purchase even on 4 oz brew , still really weak taste . 
we have been experimenting with different brands of k cups since we purchased our keurig last christmas while this one was okay , it just is not as good green mountain 's breakfast blend for an everyday staple we have n't tried green mountain columbian yet as a closer comparison however , when we make a larger cup of coffee with this one , the brew is noticibly weaker than with gm breakfast blend br br also , please note that we love timothy 's world italian blend ! ! it is definitely amount our favorites . 
after reading all the great reviews , i optimistically ordered some of this tea i 've had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success unfortunately , this really did n't do anything for me the taste is ok \( bearable \) , but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion \( so far the only things i 've found that have helped me somewhat are the vicks personal warm mist humidifier and neti xlear \) . 
this tea did n't do anything , steal have issues with itching throat , ear and everything else but i do enjoy the smell of it ill say it last up to a few hours and that 's it . 
i 've suffered from recurrent bouts of acute sinusitis that have only become worse and worse over the years every time i get an infection , my right maxillary sinus swells up like a balloon sleeping at night on account of this condition is terribly difficult i often have to resort to using afrin to decongest my sinuses , which is effective but also very painful and not a realistic , long term solution because of rebound congestion now i already irrigate with a motorized system , often upwards of 8 10x daily when i'm sick , and drinking herbal tea has also become a pasttime to help cope with my sinus disease that being said , i bought this tea out of sheer desperation i 'll try \( and have tried \) next to anything to give myself some relief while i wait for antibiotics to take effect the only thing which i find works even close to as well as afrin is to megadose on psuedoephedrine \( 240 1 2 times per day \) , which is something that is also unsustainable so , keep in mind that the severity of my sinus condition is drastic what i found with this tea is that it seems to help , but i ca n't tell whether or not it works any better than domestic teas that tout similar claims \( yogi 's breathe deep and cold buster , celestial sleepytime sinus soother , and other respiratory aiding herbal formulations \) i 've brewed it double strong to try and gain the greatest effect , and again , it seems to work modestly but nothing amazing the taste is a little bitter , but i suppose that 's a fairly reasonable indicator it has beneficial compounds in it all in all , i am likely to stick with the less exotic teas that i can buy at the grocery store as an aside , i find celestial 's sweet and spicy herbal mix to have probably the best mucus thinning effect out of all the teas i 've tried , though it 's not at all marketed as something for this purpose if you read everything they put in it , though , it makes sense that it would help . 
i had high hopes when i purchased this produce , shipping was amazingly fast and i 've tried it a few times i do n't enjoy the taste , and since i do n't sweeten my tea , it was n't that great , and it did nothing for my sinuses will not purchase again but i do recommend the seller . 
i bought this tea during a major sinus infection crisis which included headache , earache , toothache i drink multiple cups over a few days , and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect taste is so so , but that 's not really what matters as every sinus sufferer knows , if eating dirt would make the pain go away , we 'd eat dirt . 
i have ordered numerous teas , potions , lotions and other remedies but have never had a lack of product in an order that was sealed the tea bag wrapping in question was sealed without a tea bag inside i would have said something sooner , however i only tried these when i had a sinus infection and the last 3 times i tried to use one the sealed pouch was empty beware ! . 
all natural beef , but too soft for my taste does n't have the 'snap' and drier outer surface that some like this is a matter of personal taste the product is good , just not for everyone br i suggest trying this company 's old fashioned cold smoked beef sticks strong hickory flavor , a good bite of spice , and drier texture br this company has superb customer service ! . 
buffalo bills premium snacks br br i realize that taste is an individual thing , but i thought i 'd share my thoughts on these products br br first , customer service is excellent i 've always gotten exactly what i ordered in a very timely manner br br so far i 've ordered the following products br br 1 \) buffalo bills 2 1lbs mild short shots br br 2 \) buffalo bills 2 1lbs hot short shots br br the first two short shots are very similar to slim jim 's , just not individually wrapped , i just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on \( about a quarter pound per bag br br 3 \) buffalo bills 1 2lb extra smokeys br these are very smokey , but a little too dry for my taste br br 4 \) buffalo bills 16oz premium hickory beef jerky pieces \( random size br taste great if you are a jerky lover br br 5 \) buffalo bills 2 1lb pepperoni short shots br probably the closest to slim jim 's of all the short shots br br 6 \) buffalo bills 2 1lbs honey strung br o k taste my wife hates the smell my brother does n't care much for them either br br all in all , i highly recommend these products \( in the order listed \) and this company br br gunner january , 2010 . 
tried mild only br br amazon 28 on 02 12 2012 br br pro br good weight price value br br con br mushy \( was hoping it would be drier firmer like other reviews stated \) br no snap to skin br so so flavor br br hot buffalo bills 2 1lbs short shots taste good have better texture br also better price weight ratio smaller peices means better portion control . 
i could n't resist the price so many beef sticks for so cheap however , i think i was expecting something different the jerky has a good taste , and at first it was n't very oily , but as they got older \( and exposed to the air \) i did notice some oil spots forming through the casings of the sticks overall , if you can consume this , say , within 1 week of opening , they are great ! if you need something that will stick around longer \( stick , get it \? \) then maybe this is n't the right product they also sent me a free sample of some of their other products with my order , and the shipping was quick i like the company , the beef sticks just were n't what i was looking for , i guess . 
six hour power does help to create a more energetic and alert state the affect does not last anywhere near six hours for me it was a couple of hours it is not as strong as five hour power high strength , but it is not positioned as high strength either for the money , i would buy this again over the regular five hour power product . 
i guess it does the job okay and it 's much cheaper than 5 hour brand but the packaging it arrived in was in spanish since i do n't speak or read spanish i was a little leery of this item since it was impossible for me to read ingredients and nutritional information panel br the item is labelled as being made in the usa but the website on the label has a mx extension for being a mexican company br i do n't have anything against our neighbors to the south i just expect that when i buy something on amazon that the labeling will be in english unless otherwise stated . 
my husband works outside all day long due to the recent heatwave , his body is depleted of fluids due to sweat my husband uses the energy shot along with zipfizz the zipfizz provides the necessary potassium to keep the body going i personally do not recommend too many energy shot drinks during the day , but they do prove beneficial to help you keep going . 
i took a chance with this product \( even though there were n't enough good reviews \) since they are cheaper than 5 hour energy they did not work for me so i tried red rain which did work and was even cheaper red rain did work for me so i am done with 5 hour energy and 6 hour power the ingredients are pretty close to 5 hour energy but someone is lying since it does n't work . 
i 've tried a few of the different energy shots , and found that the 5 hour energy have a flowery note \( lavender \? \) in all of their flavours br br i ca n't say i like it the effect is ok , but the flavour is like bad flat orange pop , and is otherwise uninspiring i think i 'd prefer the more standard 'berry' flavour of other shots vs this one . 
i had to be taken to the er in an ambulance earlier , the day before yesterday i was having seizures , near syncope \( passing out , but still being somewhat conscious \) , could n't breathe , and my blood pressure was at stroke level i felt like and thought i was dying \( or maybe already \) dead for about 3 hours it was painful and horrifying i think i figured out what it was that caused my near death experience it was probably the energy shot i took 20 minutes before then i do n't usually take something like that someone offered it to me , and i was so tired , i did n't even look at the bottle and took it please , do n't use these ! . 
i received these in bad condition most of them were broken , but the ones that were n't had holes in them they were so weak that they would tear when you tried to roll them i would try three ladies brand they are a way higher quality . 
i purchase banh trang spring rolls skin frequently to prepare a tasty batch of fresh spring rolls , but recently i got a container with black spots mixed into the skin i tried to rinse them off when they were soaking but it did n't work and had to be thrown away at the bottom of the container , 5 skins had what looked to be tiny ants embedded within the skin at that point , i decided not to have fresh spring rolls at all until i purchased a fresh batch of a different brand when trying to find the company on the internet to write them directly , i was unable locate their company webpage , although there were many references to the co name bahn trang . 
i bought this brand and it was just horrible amazon needs to source and offer 3 ladies brand wrappers as they are just superior to anything out on the market today . 
the wrappers are good but it would have been easier if the filling was already in them the fact that it was n't meant i had to look br up what goes into a wrapper and buy water chestnuts , bamboo shoots and bean sprouts to help me make up my own filling the br wrappers are good but more work than heating up a frozen appetizer . 
i have one cat who cannot tolerate this particular fancy feast salmon product it is only the shredded one that gets her , but get it does br everytime she eats it , she throws it up all over everywhere my shoes , the white rug and gratefully , the tile br br she ate this for several years with occasional upsets , but now it is every time no more for this family i realize that this occurs on an individual basis usually br br but , i also have one younger kitty who is at the occasional upset stage so , if you have a kitty with a tender tummy , i would avoid this ! ! . 
i really wanted to like these br br first off , these cookies are about the size of a half dollar and are n't that thick and they are more like fudge that cookies look at the ingredients they are nut flour held together with honey they need some egg or something they are gooey and sticky they are extremely sweet and pack a whopping 10 15g carbs each and yes that is not counting the fiber br br i'm sorry i appreciate the effort guys but in my option these are a novetly they are too expensive and too non functional to be a serious part of your regular diet . 
i was not impressed with these cookies when i tried them , when they first came out and the company had only one flavor i did not care for them but i knew that something more satisfying could be had because i 'd tried others br br i have found many great paleo cookie recipes on web sites and in paleo cookbooks that i love and they my friends , cooking students , and neighbors have really enjoyed if you 're looking for rock your taste buds paleo cookies , i suggest you check out the recipes for chocolate chip cookies and other flavors of cookies made from blanched almond flour found in the gluten free almond flour cookbook , make it paleo , and on elana amsterdam 's web site . 
the cookies came sealed and seem to be high quality in there ingredients the only thing is they just do n't taste that good my girlfriend and i thought these might be a good dessert like option while doing the paleo diet , but after trying one of each kind over a couple days we just do n't find ourselves going back for more i would much rather not have a dessert and really check that box on a cheat day than being left wanting more after eating these if you have a true gluten allergy , maybe this is a good option for you but i'm not a believer . 
i 've been paleo for six months , as has my partner we both found these inedible all four kinds \( which , by the way , taste nearly the same \) br br i'm not sure what it is about them either it seems like they would be good from the ingredients but something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good i kept trying them again , hoping that they would grow on me they sure did n't we finally tossed them br br so , i would advise getting just one from a local co op or something before you buy a whole bunch online i sure which i had . 
formula itself is great works wonders for a baby that spits up but wtf why is it so expensive here \? 121 for 6 12 9oz cans that 's 20 for a 12 9oz can when you can buy a 24oz can at any store for less than 25 almost double the price i do n't get it . 
i love using generous amounts of vinegar on sandwiches , salads , etc , but this drink was so vinegary that i got a bit of a tummy ache it tasted closer to salad dressing than it did a drink i tried really hard to like it , but no go . 
i bought these bars for several years at my local co operative grocery store , and ate them daily they are tasty however , the price increased nearly 100 during that time , and i noticed that , although the individual wrappers within the box remained the same size , the bar within the wrapper decreased when i stopped buying these , the actual bar was only half the size of the wrapper that 's deceptive packaging , so i refuse to buy these any more i suspect that other shoppers likewise complained , because last month the store where i bought these stopped carrying them . 
barbara 's yogurt bars are okay i found the whole grain bar very dry and there really is n't much blueberry , or for that matter , apple flavors on the positive side , the bar is a soft chew total carbs 29g it 's an okay bar in the glut of cereal bars to choose from at the grocery store . 
this product was a big disappointment the picture on the box is misleading these bars are n't chunky , the dough is n't flaky \( more like cardboardy \) , they are n't filled with pieces of fruit , and if you did n't read the label \( which claims about 30 items down the ingredient list that yogurt powder is added \) , you would n't have any idea you were eating yogurt at all the bars probably contain msgs , with all of the natural flavorings , etc whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a vitamin blend there 's too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition , anyway the experience is very much like eating a long , thin fig bar only not as tasty the fig bars i buy at my neighborhood grocery contain sugar , but also real fruit , whole wheat , no msgs , and no trans fats i 'd rather eat one of them i wo n't be purchasing this product again . 
these are n't as good as other bars of this type my kids wo n't eat them , nor will my husband they are all fond of the nutrigrain variety , but i thought these would be a healthier alternative . 
looked like a good deal , so i ordered the ground fennel , as well as 4 other spices and seasonings from this company , but was disappointed with them all zero flavor , not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when loosely sealed containers were opened the dill smelled like dried musty grass , and the onion even worse ended up throwing them all away save your money , do not buy this product . 
when i received this product it was old and dried out ! dingo makes a good product i buy them all the time and my dog loves them but this supplier should pay more attention to what they ship . 
most of the nuts in these bags were so old they had turned black totally worthless will never order again . 
i did not even receive the correct product , what i received were raw unshelled peanuts , but had no option to return them becuase amazon does not allow this i attempted to contact but got no reply , do not buy from here ! . 
a href http www amazon com gp product b001eo6bcc royal oak gourmet virginia raw in shell peanuts , 2 5 pound bags \( pack of 3 \) a br br i 'll appreciate your speedy deliver of my package , however you sent me raw peanuts without the shell this item is going into a gift basket for my pastor because he love raw peanuts in a shell i do n't have time to returned them for the requested product you have always been prompt with my orders in the past and i really do appreciate this is the first time you sent me an incorrect product i 'll make it work . 
i would agree with the other poor ratings for royal oak very poor customer service from royal oak we ordered , this year , the exact same product as last year when it arrived , the nuts were not the same product , and they would not refund or pay shipping for the return also , they only operate the few weeks that peanuts are 'in season ' otherwise , emails and phone calls are not even acknowledged . 
go to costco , and you can buy lower than this price per oz currently 32 \( 3 off regular 34 99 \) tax for big size 0 83 oz br br besides , it is more convinient to return if you kid does not like this formula br br be careful , many times some sellers over price a product , and still make the product rank in the best sellers . 
be careful when odering this , because they say it 's a 6 pk , but you will only get a 4 pk , plus the formula goes out in 4 months so if you did like i did and got it early for grandchildren your out of luck ! so i know i will not be buying off of this site again for food for my grandchildren , because they wo n't be able to eat it . 
if one reads this products ingredients they will find that the first ingredient is cows milk , then sugar \( diabetic maker \) , then milk , again the fourth ingredient is sunflower oil , fifth ingredient is maltodextrin which is starch produced from grain containing the sugars maltose and dextrin , with the seventh ingredient being , get this , tuna fish oil they even feature vitamin d3 , which is animal derived there are four different sugar sources in it and some artificial flavor for good measure if we really think about what we are feeding our babies , would we use this product \? i know i would n't know your food sources . 
these were rancid upon receipt terrible very little sugar if any used something went wrong with these as i ca n't believe anyone would see this as a final product both cans ! . 
i like that these are organic and do n't have corn syrup my kids and i both like them i 'd give them 5 stars but i noticed earlier this year that they changed the recipe the crackers are lighter and flakier than they used to be and they break more easily and if you have kids under 5 , you might understand how upsetting broken crackers can be the taste is still great , but i preffered the old texture myself and definitely for my kids who cry when the crackers break while they are eating them and when you order these in the mail , like i did last time , do n't expect many full graham cracker sheets most are already broken in two , and quite a few are broken at the edges as well . 
these crackers are terrific , and they are priced right however , i ordered them on 10 29 06 , and the expiration date on the box was 12 31 06 we have only eaten four boxes they still taste fine after the expiration date , but am i really expected to consume 12 boxes in 2 months \? . 
i felt ripped off the photo clearly shows two bones and the price , at 8 plus , is indicative of two i thought i was purchasing a bone packaged as two to a pack walmart sells identical big smoked knuckle bones for 3 50 ea why does n't the photo show one bone instead of two if they are just shipping one \? it was n't worth the hassle to return the package to make my point of protest so i am doing it here beartoothjoe . 
is that these are 60 calories per serving , however , in all honesty , i did n't make it through a full serving br br i was excited about these , they looked like a grown up graham cracker br br first problem was the smell they smelled like melted plastic , and something else i 'd hesitate to even guess what it is , but it 's bad i bravely pulled out one small crisp , hoping that maybe it was the packaging that had the aroma it was not the crisp itself smells horrific br i figured there was no way it could taste as bad as it smelled br second problem is that i was very , very wrong about that they have a funky , chemical taste that just defies description the aftertaste is sort of like a skunky chewing on a plastic pen cap that went thru the wash wet cardboard kinda taste seriously , it was awful br br i tasted these about 45 minutes ago , and after drinking an entire bottle of water and brushing my teeth , i can still taste it br br i'm glad these were an add on , but they are still absolutely terrible their only redeeming quality is that they are cute not one single member of my family will actually eat them though , so this was definitely a waste of 3 had i known they would be this awful , i 'd have just got a second bag of a href http www amazon com gp product b007poa158 hi i'm skinny sticks , sweet onion multigrain , 7 ounce a br only 30 cent more than these , but miles better in taste . 
if you love vegetable soup you should like this yes it has come chicken and large noodle type items in it too br but it was not as good as i expected or hoped it would be . 
i enjoyed this soup it was flavorful with a nice blend of spices i will buy it again . 
tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups , and i like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties although i did n't expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup , i did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups i have tried , that is a light broth with a mix of vegetables , corn , beans chicken and mexican spices this soup is thick really thick , like the thickest tomato soup you 've ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich it 's also sweet , and does not taste in the least like a mexican soup instead , imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables , beans and some chicken thrown in br br i ended up giving it all away , and , to be fair , one of the people i gave the soup to said her husband really liked it br br for a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup , try a href http www amazon com gp product b0014eub7i campbell 's select mexican chicken tortilla , 18 6 ounce cans \( pack of 12 \) a . 
coconut water should not be sweetened ! ! ! actually no sugar should ever be added sweeting things is an american custom , which ruins the real flavor of coconut water i lived in jamaica for 4 years and the bahamas for 2 , and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar , its natural br i will stick to buying the brown hard shell coconuts from the supermarket and drink that it 's more natural and unaltered these boxed , caned and packaged coconut water are nasty , i am still yet to try a brand , one of the many that i have tried that will make me wanna buy it . 
it says habenero peppers on the ingredients , but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle smells like molasses and soy sauce taste like molasses and soy sauce absolutely boring . 
tastes too sweet , which jerk seasoning is not walker 's woods is the most authentic to taste this was a waste . 
i thought i would try this , but i am sticking with my uncle joes jerk sauce ! ! ! this is sweet not hot should be hot if they are going to put jerk on the label . 
\( first of all , somebody is chasing me around and negging all my review so dont pay any br attention to those no votes , they both arrived within minutes of posting this review \) br br this sickly sweetish molasses flavored thing is not jerk sauce , doesnt even remotely br resemble a bad facsimile i dont know what world harbors is thinking , cause this stuff br is horrible br br btw , i like their teriyaki sauce , but this its as bad as it gets . 
these are very tasty , but way too sweet sugary i felt like i was eating candy instead of meat if that 's okay with you , then you 'll probably love these , but i was looking for something a bit healthier yes , i know it says 'sweet' in the product name , but i bought it because of the no hormone , no antibiotic , no artificial ingredient aspect . 
i wanted to love this because i love earl grey tea , i need decaf and i adore the convenience of the keurig unfortunately , i do n't love these the flavor is very weak and does n't deliver on the aroma i typically use the large cup setting on the 3 size model , but even the small cup is wimpy with these i did find that mixing this one with a stronger flavored decaf tea results in a more suitable strength , but then you have to make 2 cups of something the english breakfast decaf is a much better choice . 
these are not awful if eaten with a cup of tea , coffee or milk but they are very dry if eaten plain i do like how they have less sugar than most granola bars and are not a choking hazard for toddlers like hard snacks can sometimes be i am a fan of the oatmeal raisin mini cookies , and of the regular size eb cookies , but this flavor tastes very fruity to me and not very chocolaty i think the double choc cherry tastes better than these happy to have them for last resort snack on the go needs , but not my favorite . 
my kids love these , and we 've ordered them often but as was the case with at least one other reviewer , this batch came in with some mold \( i freeze them as soon as they arrive , so had the have been moldy upon arrival \) br br too bad but at this price , wo n't run the risk of having to toss out product . 
i started out thinking they were ok , a little more substance than the breakfast bar from whole foods but after i ordered a 12 pack \( i did n't realize it was 12 boxes of 8 \) , and had eaten them for a couple of weeks as i was flying out the door , i realized they were not really very tasty and kind of dry . 
i 've been on the hunt for high quality , yet affordable cat food for my little ones the past few months i decided to order a case of felidae \( along with a case of a href http www amazon com gp product b000vk8b8w pet guard fish , chicken liver food for cats a \) well , they love the petguard but absolutely hate the felidae , all three of them sniffed licked it and looked at me like you 're kidding right \? even mixing in some of their old food and gradually trying to change them over would n't work , they 'd sniff it and walk off br br they love the petguard though and will inhale it the second i put it on their plates , so at least i discovered one good food they 'll eat i guess i 'll donate the 8 cans of felidae i have left to the local shelter despite the fact my cats would n't eat it i still gave it 3 stars because it is a great quality food if your cats will eat it . 
this slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpet ! br br she devours the felidae platinum , \( which we feed as an occasional alternative to newman 's own turkey \) she was raised on felidae dry , so i can say that generally the canidae company provides quality products except for this grain free slop you can find the good stuff at a href http www amazon com gp product b000wfl09s felidae canned cat food for senior and overweight cats , platinum diet formula \( pack of 12 13 ounce cans \) a br br absolutely do not order this slop from amazon because they will charge you 10 70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat before you make the same stupid mistake i did , buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first then , when your cat pukes this slop back up , you will only be out 1 59 instead of the 27 94 amazon nailed me br br in my opinion , your cat and you will be much better off with newman 's own organic cat food , especially the turkey and chicken the newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death ! after we listened to our former vet and fed her science diet k d , she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month we switched her back to newman 's own turkey and within one 24 case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6 2lbs , and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months she also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the k d i read somewhere that science diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products nice br br just say no to science diet and felidae grain free formula here 's the good stuff a href http www amazon com gp product b000vk8hj0 newman 's own organics turkey vegetable formula for cats , 5 5 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a br br \( did they really want me to post a video with this review \? would you \? then its unanimous , this review will remain video free ! \) . 
i 've been feeding wellness grain free for a while now and all three of them love it i ordered the felidae last time because the wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the felidae was which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at petco brick and mortar none of my cats will eat it they actually at nothing for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the felidae i broke down today and gave them a back up can of 9 lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now i think felidae is a high quality food and i only feed the lower quality grain free food on rare occasion , but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter hopefully , something there will like it i'm off for the trip to petco for the wellness . 
my cats are n't usually picky and i 've had them on natural balance venison grain free canned and dry food but one still has digestive problems \( probably from ten years of eating junk kitty food \) so i keep trying to find a food that will help to heal him i tried felidae and he and one other cat eats it , but the other two do n't i do believe one is extremely picky because he wo n't eat halo brand either but loves the natural balance and taste of the wild grain free options i hate having to buy so many different brands to please my four cats ! also this says 95 protein derived from fish so maybe they are having a distaste for the fish \? it 's too bad because they do love tuna but it causes the sick one to vomit every time oh well , it 's a another miss in our family . 
the consistency of the grain free chicken , turkey , lamb and fish formula was like br baby poop there was so much water in this cat food that two cats went through a br full case in a short time i can put the water in the cat food it is misleading br and a poor value for the manufacturer to water down a product , call it a 13 oz can br and provide nothing like i have come to know and expect from other brands the same br size . 
i was really hoping this grain free canned cat food will work for my 3 cats looks like it has good ingredients but none of my 3 cats will eat it in fact one of them will smell it and start doing the scratching thing like he smells poop another weird thing is the whole can is kind of soft and meshed like baby food but there are some whole green peas in it , not sure if that is by design or some green peas escape the meshing . 
first off , my cats loved the food one of them has had issues in the past and i need to be careful with what i feed him , and this seems to work well however , about half the cans were your normal , semisolid cat food consistency , and the other half were incredibly runny and nasty looking they ate both kinds with equal gusto so i do n't think anything was wrong with it , per se , but i still found it a little concerning i'm ordering another batch , and we 'll see how that turns out . 
i gave it 3 stars because of the quality ingredients but if neither of my cats will eat it , what 's the use \? we tried weaning them to this food from the junk we 've been feeding them by mixing and slowly increasing the amount of felidae , or by getting them real hungry first , all to no avail the only way they 'll eat it is if we cover it with drippings from fish we cook for ourselves , or from cans of sardines br br more than anything , i think the mushy pate type texture bothers them more that the taste , because it smells pretty good to me . 
wonderful ingredients list but the peas are whole if i do n't mush them several of my cats just eat around them br the cats i all prefer the regular felidae formula and it 's a little cheaper , too . 
yikes ! what was i thinking when i ordered 12 cans of this stuff \? the food pantry may be getting some br br it tastes like well , i ca n't use the words i 'd like to br let 's just say that it has no character at all no distinct taste if yu blinded yourself and then drank the coffee , i do n't know if you 'd even know it was coffee ! br br i use just more than the amount suggessted does n't help . 
i was drinking yuban organic medium roast coffee until i could not find it anymore at my local grocery store so i tried this instead what a let down after drinking the organic coffee this just tastes like average grocery store coffee comparable to folgers but the organic stuff , now that 's a different story that stuff is good tastes damn near as good as the fresh stuff you can buy at dunn bros or caribou coffee houses do n't believe me try both this and the organic version side by side you wo n't go back to this again i promise you that if you have any coffee sense at all . 
i wish they had n't changed the formula for the yuban that was sold up until about 2 years ago i even contacted general foods and asked why they had reformulated their coffee and they told me they were going back to their original formula from many years ago why \? they had a great product and now it is no better that any other dark roast coffee on the market yuban was a special treat now it is just ordinary i still like it for everyday coffee , but it sure is n't what it used to be formerly , i even preferred it to starbucks , but no more . 
warning it contains food preservatives other than that it is fine , but presence of preservatives in dates \( ! \) justifies my low 2 star rating . 
this pub mix is really a cut above your average snack to be sure i tend to pick up a tub of it at the local walmart here anytime i venture there the flavor of it is really hard to pin down it 's sorta a salty , garlic onion whatever type of blend that truly works deliciously i'm a self confessed snack a holic that has tried just about everything around , and personally i have not tasted anything that is quite like this blend it 's really good with your favorite beer , or just by itself and i highly recommend it the only down side to this stuff is the price which is not something usually cared about or taken into account with utz products , which tend to be very reasonably priced for the most part unfortunately like a lot of things that are really good , this mix is not easily found locally i see it only at the local walmart here in the small 20 oz size that carries a hefty price i buy it anyway on occasion for its so good , but make no mistake about it , its not cheap as snack chips go and unfortunately i do not recommend buying this mix on amazon in any size it 's way too expensive here for any deal currently being offered if you wanna try it or like it already , i suggest you search it out locally at your big department stores , \( it 's never found in supermarkets 'round these parts \) , spring for the price , and grab an ice cold beer and enjoy . 
the taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the msg those who are sensitive beware also , msg addition is usually a way to fake true flavor . 
the problem with this mix and to mind , the only problem ! is the inclusion of one or two slightly sugary little things this provides an experience of , well , repugnance , at least for me i 've never been one to mix the sodium and the glucose , and this surely ai n't converting me especially when they 're in the same bite handful ugh br br otherwise , this mix is really yummy it all tastes rather waxy , and i'm sure is not the healthiest food in the world \( though you could do worse \) , but its a well combined mixture br br but then again , i 've got to sort of work my way through at a crawling pace , because i must grab a handful , and then separate the rejects maybe i'm just neurotic , or maybe they made a fatal mistake and should be punished br br oh yeah , like the last reviewer , i too got 'em at costco . 
the packet of these seeds that i received must have been old because i do n't believe even 10 of them grew i tried some several times in soil and water and only got a few sprigs of grass i garden regularly \( i live in florida \) so it 's not that i do n't know how , and i even followed the instructions to the letter , but they did not grow . 
cat grass is cat grass , and i have one cat that absolutely loves it another that could n't care less it 's winter now , so i could n't find it where i buy seeds , so i went on line product is okay , service was prompt my disappointment could only order one two ounce package per shipping and handling fee cat grass only lasts a couple of weeks , and i would have ordered 3 or 4 packages , but not at 3 or 4 times that shipping fee ! . 
it was hard to grow but once it grew my cat loved it i have n't found any seeds that work well yet , but i am still looking i would buy this again is f i had better luck with growing it . 
my cat love this grass really easy to grow , only 3 days im not going to count the seeds but i dont think they are 500 seeds . 
do n't know why people want to step in cold cat vomit on their to the bathroom in the middle of night , but this will get the job done vomit stains carpets , beds , shirts you will find hard , old fossilized vomit under beds occasionally too entire rooms of carpet will need replacing br br if you have all wood floors and love cat vomit , go for it br br however , it is a beautiful decorative grass when potted on it 's own or mixed with herbs just keep out of cat 's reach good air freshener if you grow enough indoors br br no idea why people want cat vomit indoors though br br 3 stars because it is wheat grass which can be bought in bulk much cheaper for couple bucks more . 
look at the ingredients it is made with black tea google black tea and fluoride and you will see that black tea is loaded with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea fluoride is not healthy for anyone if you want a healthy natural tea , get one that is made with white tea leaves white tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much , much , much less fluoride than either black or green teas . 
just received a case of this tea it tastes good and a bit on the sweet side , but not overly sweet i would give it a higher and better rating if it is not made in china though . 
i enjoyed my 1st cup very much the aroma was heady and the flavor was pleasantly mild but , ultimately , it is too mild for my daily morning kick i 'll be going back to my lavazza mornings when this is gone . 
spent 29 for real kona coffee and did n't want the kona blend sold here the hawaiian roasters was disappointing tasted nothing like the kona we had everyday while honeymooning in maui not good . 
i like my chocolate tempered to some level of crispness these nuts were chewy , not crunchy , and the chocolate coating was a bit mealy br if you know anything about dark chocolate , and like yours with some snap , do n't order these br br actually , the best dark chocolate covered walnuts are called perigord and are available through a canadian company called kis global br they are sun dried , super crispy , covered in a fairly thin shell of 70 dark chocolate , and dusted with unsweetened cocoa br very adult and superb . 
we ordered the product our dog loves them but no one cares if its 100 degrees outside recieved in one big melted ball thought they would ship in dry ice if its summer or hot in your area dont order them ! ! . 
by the time i received this product all 3 packages were melted so all had to be thrown away because everything in each bag had melted together . 
i can not believe that this is actually for sale it needs to be recalled sugar is absolutely unhealthy for all your pets they do not digest assimilate sugar like we do every vet will tell you the same thing and you will never see any quality treats or food that has sugar or corn syrup on the ingredient list if you do see it on the list , do not buy it ! ! . 
this is my 2nd review for this product the first one was supposed to be 75 words that would be too long for this item the product itself is good but the price for shipping for such a small item was ridiculous the package was small and light weight but i was charged 6 78 for shipping of a 4 99 item i have bought many items from amazon com and it seems here lately that the shipping has gotten totally out of hand i bought several items and the shipping was all together therefore i did not know how much was charged for each item i will not buy from this vendor again since they are making money on the shipping enough said . 
not bad , but there are better gums than this one at the beginning is a big explosion of flavor and sugar like sensation , but after 5 minutes is gone . 
if ever there was a gum to worry about having in your stomach for seven years \( as the popular myth states \) , this one is the most likely it tastes great , sure , but in the first few bites , it falls apart , losing any cohesiveness \( gummyness \) , and just gets swallowed for some reason , about 1 3 of it remains intact and becomes gum what little remains is as the other reviewers state , but knowing that i 've swallowed more than half the sticks i 've chewed is not a pleasant thought . 
initially , the flavor is fairly accurate , however weak from there , the flavor diminishes rapidly i just timed it , and this gum goes flat within 5 minutes br in light of my experience , i find these rave reviews somewhat amusing one reviewer even went as far as to describe it as incredibly tart meh br like many new products in the realm of gum , pop , energy drinks , and fast food , they only need you to buy one if everyone does that , they 'll be sitting pretty br based on this experience , i have no desire to try the other flavors of extra dessert delights br three stars it 's ok , but does n't live up to the hype . 
on top of the delightful aspartame , this comes complete with hydrogenated oils and is a dead ringer for country time lemonade mix . 
instead of just being pork rinds , oil , salt and vinegar , they have lactose and maltodextrin on them , contributing to 2g of sugar per serving many people \( myself included \) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets they will not be happy about the sugar br br the labeling on the package is very strange , and i am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing it says total carbohydrates are less then 1g , so they get to put zero grams ok , fair enough , i have seen that before but then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar , which is a carbohydrate how they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me i assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet br br then there is protein the nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving not bad for a snack food right next to the 8g is says not a significant source of protein huh a slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein , as is an ounce of meet i believe those are significant sources of protein br br i went to their website , to check out the nutritional facts i did notice they were high in sodium what i missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1 75 oz package was three \( 3 \) , so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher i doubt many people expect a 1 75 oz package to be three servings i just looked up fritos corn chips a 2 oz package is considered a single serving package , and the analysis on the back shows one serving so when fritos tells you the sodium level , it is only 320 mg for the entire package for these pork rinds , the 1 75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium , about half of your daily requirement a little steep for a snack br br although i went to their site to look at some nutritional info , they do n't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at amazon if they had , i would not have purchased it they use partially hydrogenated oil , a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label , a lot of the food industry has switched away from it , as people are correctly suspicious of it br br to add insult to injury , i was unhappy with the taste they have a chemical , nasty taste i suppose that is subjective , but a few bites left me a little queasy br br i feel bad having bought this , but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack please pass this company 's products by , and let 's find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational , ethical and legal way . 
this product \( which i am not allowed to return \) has ingrediants of salt , spices , hydrolysed soy protein , that last item is the common industry con for adding msg to your food every soup on your grocers shelf contains msg , but , i digress so , the third ingrediant is a form of msg , further down the ingrediant list is proudly displayed monosodium gludamate , msg this does not add spice to your food , it stimulats your tongue into feeling that the food tastes good , when it does not msg can make dogfood taste like hamburger anyone who thinks this is making their food taste cajun may be serving alpo tones and durkee \( sp \) do not contain msg , i prefer tones ! br br i have 8 eight ounce cans of this stuff would anybody like to buy some hamburger from me \? . 
i bought this seasoning because amazon stopped selling the 12 count konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count i bought it thinking it would be similar to the konriko , boy was i wrong ! ! ! br br first of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows hydrolyzed soy protein , and partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil i was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix now i know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein as the other reviewer stated it 's a industry way of adding msg well why in the world do we need that and what 's up with the hydrogenated soy bean and cottonseed oil ! ! ! ! beside it being bad for your health it causes the product to cake and clump i steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them an even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health when i purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description , now it is i think that amazon as a regular practice should require all food products company 's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site why wait until the customer purchase it to find out \? \? \? ! ! ! i do n't think this is a customer friendly practice ! ! ! ! br br not a good buy imo i found my konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there unless amazon brings it back at a 12 count offer otherwise to buy one at 8 and 4 99 s h is just way over priced and highway robbery ! ! ! ! . 
i thought i was doing my kid a favor when i invested in a case of earth 's best dinners unfortunately , the second ingredient \( after water \) for all of these is applesauce or in the case of the sweet potato chicken variety , it 's sweet potatoes , followed by apricot puree br br after getting used to the sweetness of these \( try 'em they 're like jam \) , it 's difficult for kids to adjust to real food from now on , i'm going to stick with just pureeing home cooked food it 's a lot cheaper , too . 
i agree with a previous reviewer when it comes to the dinners \( just about all of the earth 's best choices \) they are watery and sweet apples \( or some other fruit \) in just about everything , and the first ingredient is nearly always water i 've decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein containing dinners from another jarred brand \( or mixing my own \) i 'd really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age ! br br the earth 's best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great just check the label to make sure water is n't the first ingredient listed \( i just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up \) . 
as i have with all other earth 's best jarred baby food , i wo n't be purchasing these dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain bpa i contacted earth 's best 's consumer relations dept personally , and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines earth 's best baby food jar lids contains trace amounts of bpa , but it does n't come into direct contact with the food that kind of lukewarm response was n't enough to put my concerns about bpa to rest after all , packaged food is jostled around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down , with the food resting directly on the jar lids so i guess i 'll have to pass on these jarred dinners for now \( the earth 's best rep did say that they were doing accelerated testing of bpa free alternatives for lining their baby food jars \) br br this is such a shame , because earth 's best is the only company that makes organic , pre packaged stage 2 complete meals \( e g , with meat protein , veggies carbs starch \) in puree form all the other organic baby food manufacturers , such as plum , sprout , ella 's kitchen , etc , only make stage 3 meals , in chunky form earth 's best does make some baby food in bpa free squeeze pouches , but that does n't include its dinner line i was hoping to be able to expose my little one to a wider variety of flavors and well balanced meals while still at the puree stage but i guess i 'll have to wait until she 's old enough for stage 3 chunky meals , or make her baby food myself \( virtually impossible for this super busy and domestically challenged mom , lol ! \) . 
i ordered this from amazon and they were pure liquid like water i did not feel at all comfortable feeding them to my daughter amazon customer service , however , was awesome and gave me a full refund . 
bought this after reading the good reviews not sure if it has to do only with my package but rice and lentil mix literally has a smell of mold i actually opened two containers to make sure it was n't just my nose playing tricks on me i love this brand and i am very disappointed . 
to be honest , my baby did n't really love all of these at first he 's pretty picky , so i had to mix fruit into some of these to get him interested in a few of them he took to the gourmet meals pack right away , but did n't love all of these but as he 's gotten older , he 's gotten less picky and seems to accept all of these flavors now without having to bribe him by mixing in fruit the prices on amazon are good , so i will continue to order these here . 
amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on time , but , i guess this is one product that they can not br br several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out i wish i could order this by mail but it seems this is one item we 'll need to go to the grocery store for . 
i did like this product until some jars i found black mold on the inner lids br br i read other reviews , but i thought it must 've been a bad batch i was wrong br br earth 's best used to be very good so i canceled my next subscribe and save order then i feedback cancel reason to amazon . 
love earths best but my 8 mth old daughter only liked one of the 4 selections i highly recommend buying just one of each from the store and having your baby test them before buying these in bulk walmart usually has them for 60 each . 
i was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews i was n't really impressed when my son tried the food the consistency was way too thin , and my son would hardly eat the whole jar i would recommend making your own baby food , or use the gerber organic . 
our pediatrician told me to include some form of meat at dinner for our baby unfortunately , two of the four varieties do n't include meat i do n't think summer vegetable should be included in a dinner variety pack , that 's what the vegetable variety pack is for also , the chicken and sweet potato is extremely runny and hard to feed to a baby . 
3 of the flavors are pretty good but the sweet potato chicken is pretty gross i was wondering why my daughter did n't want to eat it until i tried it myself . 
my baby did n't seem into these dinners , so i tried them they 're not terrible , but not good either we 'll stick with the eb fruits and veggies until she 's ready for table foods . 
we ordered the earth 's best 2nd dinner variety pack along with the fruit variety pack we got the fruit variety pack and an oatmeal and fruit variety pack , not the dinner pack found out we ca n't return the item , either we will try the amazon phone help , but if all else fails maybe my little one will like this stuff . 
my baby loves this food at whole foods they sell the same flat for 10 99 and thats retail i ordered this and just received it today i had n't even opened package and i could smell a rotten smell coming from box i opened it to find jar smashed and mold everywhere ! i'm so disgusted and ca n't believe i waited over a week for this to arrive what a waste of my time the worst part is i ordered the fruit flat as well and also a broken jar and rotten mold everywhere i do n't get how this happens the shipping box is n't dented or damaged neither is the flat box so what someone packaged and sent a smashed and rotting shipment \? not a happy customer ! . 
do n't let the earth 's best name fool you as stated in multiple reviews here check the ingredients ! no wonder so many positive reviews here have the same theme , my kids will only eat earth 's best ! well that 's because they are all sweetened , which is one of the worst things you can feed to your child regularly they will develop a sweet tooth quickly , and will start rejecting pure vegetables other good things because of this there is no need to inject applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods that 's just shameful , and there is only one reason for it so the child will eat it and only want this brand br br best advice if you must buy pre made food , be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredient \( s \) and \( if needed \) water that 's it do n't buy a vegetable that has applesauce or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that brand because it 's sweetened br br shame on earth 's best as a company kudos to their marketing department for creating a name whereas consumers will automatically be drawn to them because they think it 's a great product based solely on the name . 
google propylene glycol to find out why i bought this product , along with several others , without running the ingredients by my wife first \( a nurse of 30 years \) she br was surprised when she noticed it we went a googling , and poured my 50 order down the drain afterwards there 's pure and then there 's not so much br br from the website br br propylene glycol br br a cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze in the skin and hair , propylene glycol works as a humescent , which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water the material safety data sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage br also used in br br tyre sealant br rubber cleaner br de icer br stain removers br fabric softener br degreaser br paint br adhesive br wallpaper stripper br br i wrote the company about this concern and they never responded . 
received 6 bottles of concentrate from paragon mixed exactly to their specs , and was extremely disappointed in four of the six flavors br br i am truly saddened to have to encourage you to not purchase the watermelon flavor br br this item has be returned for a refund . 
i was disappointed to find out that the lids of earth 's best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains bpa \( br i thought i was avoiding the whole bpa issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers if it 's in the lids , it 's going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging , shipping , storage , etc i was planning on being a devoted earth 's best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass , but then i found out about the bpa as a note , if bpa does n't bother you , most of earth 's best food is tasty . 
packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten however , amazon com does not let me return it this is not right ! ! ! ! i have put the pic of the food on packaging review page buyers should all take a look at it . 
just off the phone with them \( aug 12 \) and they said that yes they stopped putting bpa in the liners in oct 11 of course there is old stock on the shelves so i asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the old \( with bpa \) or the new \( without bpa \) and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid if it is all white then it is bpa free if it is metallic or gold then it 's the old lids which did contain a bpa layer thought this might help some of you out there ! . 
i ordered this because i really like this brand and i have never had any issue with them my son usually like all the flavors i ordered this and the pears were sour spoiled the other flavors my son refused to eat i am sure there was something wrong with it so i am not sure what happened but i will not be buying these online anymore . 
several broke during transit causing mold to grow over all the other jars jars are cheaper at walmart . 
beware of what you are being charged it says that it 's 9 99 but 911drugstore is charing you 39 99 plus 14 in shipping \( i 've found this to be true for several other items on this site \) br i'm not sure if this is a misprint amazon does n't seem to think it 's an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item i disagree , and think it 's amazon 's responisbility to get to the bottom of this . 
i just called up customer service and found that since october 2011 , all the jars are bpa free but the jars manufactured before october , 2011 are still available in the market usually all these products have a long shelf life as they are vacuum sealed so the jars with bpa lining on the lids are still floating around in the market the consumers cannot tell the difference so what is the point in buying this when you do not know if you are giving your baby something that is bpa free or not \? \? \? this is very very disappointing from earth 's best . 
i usually feed earth 's best baby food to my grandson he has never had a reaction of any kind to any baby food i have given him this is the first time i have tried this particular variety pack i fed him the peach oatmeal banana and apples and apricots for breakfast this morning shortly after i noticed he was scratching i looked and he had a rash i remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so i checked and yes it is this variety pack i do n't know what is in it that would cause this type of reaction unfortunately i fed him two different jars so i do n't know which one caused it but i do n't want to take a chance of him having another one so out they go just thought i would let others know . 
amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on time , but , i guess this is one product that they can not br br several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out i wish i could order this by mail but it seems this is one item we 'll need to go to the grocery store for . 
i like their variety package , but also heard that there is bpa in the lid i will switch to other bpa free products . 
there is bpa in the lids and company claims it does n't touch the food so it 's okey why do they even write organic 6 times around the lid \? not honest to their costumer i would n't even give 1 star if l could . 
i have a 6 5 month old who eats 2 food all of the time i bought this variety pack and noticed that the peach oatmeal is thick like a paste coincidentally , as i was thinking that as i was feeding him he started choking and gasping for air he could n't breathe and i had to give him the heimlich maneuver and luckily he started crying very scary and those jars went right in the garbage . 
this food is phenomenal but way overpriced i pay 7 99 a case in new york city and it is often on sale for less than 6 a case at babiesrus in new york city grocery prices are obscene in ny so if i am paying less here , this is no deal . 
this is ok rice it cooks fairly well in my cooker , not as good as some other tho but the taste is really very earthy i do n't mind that too much , but this is almost too strong tasting . 
i eat basamati brown rice quite often and found this to be relatively flavorless br it cooked very well in my rice cooker , but did not embody that wonderful nutty aroma and flavor the grains are finer and have less body than what i have enjoyed in other brands maybe personal preference would not try again . 
the reviewer from florida was being extremely kind in their review br this gruel is not even fit for farm animals i 've lived in hawaii most br of my life and have shopped mostly in the local health food stores so i have had br many many different batches of basmati rice what amazon has sent me is not br edible in my opinion it is not long grained as basmati should be and does not br cook as it should it fully cooks too soon and does not need the full amount of br water that basmati usually does br i am tempted to contact the fda to see what it really is ! br br my apologies to the reviewer from florida i should have listened to you and br passed on all this frustration amazon does not allow returns on groceries br needless to say i am now stuck with several pounds of inedible rice . 
i love fact that this drink is neither too tangy or tos sweet the combimation of both is perfect and therefore quenches yor thirst without leaving an unpleant after taste t . 
i would never buy this cake it looks horrible some of the fondant work on this seller 's other cakes is shabby the piping is horrible worse than a cake you would buy at the grocery store the flowers look like red and green blobs how can you possibly think you should sell these to people \? . 
i love green tea and green tea beverages when i saw this on sale i was happy to try it once i received it and tasted it i was not so happy first off tasted like the smell of dirty water best way i can describe it lol this has cane juice yet tastes like it does n't have anything added calories for what no flavor \? no thanks so yeah all in all pretty flavorless \( beside the dirty water smell taste \) was a huge disappointment worse yet i bought 2 12 pk cases now i have to doctor the rest up maybe just buy some lemons and make them into a green tea lemonade \? oh well , i tried . 
it 's got the typical jif taste , which to me is unremarkable it 's just peanut butter however , the single serve containers are convenient and transport well the consistency is great it 's not runny yet it 's also not a solid hunk a peanut butter with floating oil either good for dipping pretzels or celery other veggies , and in the absence of a spreder you can just tear off the top and squuush the contents onto bread br br the price is right . 
maybe it 's just me , but i have used this extract in my oatmeal \( same amount as mccormick extracts \) and i ca n't taste any flavor at all very disappointing . 
in the attempt to make blueberry cake for my brother , i used the whole bottle and still did n't have a blueberry cake i added about half the bottle to the cake mix \( white cake not vanilla \) , and the other half to the frosting \( white frosting not vanilla \) and it still only had a hint of blueberry flavor i was completely disappointed in all the time , effort and money spent making it , and it barely tasted blueberry i would have thought that using the whole bottle would have made a blueberry flavor i guess i will have to see if i can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry flavored extract will not be wasting my money on this again \( . 
something is very wrong the product is excellent i have been buying it for several years , first at whole foods , and then when they dropped the product , i have been purchasing it online in fact , i purchased it in its original larger size jar when the size was decreased to 8 82 oz , the selling price remained the same at whole foods i also purchased all flavors as this product is really delicious br br the price has been going up considerably i purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping with each order there is always another price increase br br my recent order of september 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store the store did not repack it each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item it stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor the following information shocked me , and i quote br br rigoni fruit sprd 8 82 oz pack 6 retail 5 99 br br did you note the price \? retail 5 99 ! ! ! ! it did not state wholesale , it said retail price no one sells it for 5 99 , yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price am i missing something here \? how many hundreds of dollars have i wasted \? \? \? i guess it is a matter of what the market will bear outrageous ! of course there is the additional shipping chg on principal alone i will give up on this product the greed is beyond comprehension br br i gave the product a low rating , even though the product is excellent because it is incredibly overpriced . 
good stuff , but may be a bit expensive in relation to more local products love the no sugar added , but found product at local store for half the price would continue to purchase if i did not have cheaper option . 
i believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches it now has a sour after taste and my son hates it . 
they have some textured powder stuff on them that makes them taste bad bad after taste i guess it 's so they do n't stick together never again . 
so as soon as the delivery guy gave me the package i opened it ready to eat some gummy bears and all i got was a big goo of gummy bears due to the heat of the delivery truck it all melted into gel of course it is not refundable so now all i have is a bag a liquid multicolored goo thanks for making me throw away 15 dollars good game amazon so think about if its summer or kinda warm , stop and wait till december . 
the taste is not horrible but it is not very good there is not a very good mango flavor i would not buy again . 
oh my gosh i bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon by evening i was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea i belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves during internet research i discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products also the following admonition do n't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels br br side effects can include br diarrhea br intestinal cramps or gripping pains br rash br severe weight loss br br senna should not be used by persons with crone 's disease , diverticular disease and other similar diseases br br senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage br br i wanted to die my insides hurt so bad any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain be aware before you use i threw my remaining 29 tea bags away ! . 
i dont like the taste of this at all i have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic cant remember exact name but think it is something like mb is a french company and i got it in canada and by mail order after that it is much better to my taste never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient . 
this is not for me it was like eating a bowl of fat not my preference everyone is different personally i dont like this at all . 
this egg pasta ingredient was powdered egg product and as such not as tasty as those containing the real thing i do n't like anything powdered , but price was right ca n't have it all i guess . 
the cats do n't like this flavor i would have preferred an assortment of flavors the product itself is good i just have finicky cats and i am weaning them off wet food , anyway my older cat is getting too big ! notice i did n't say fat ! \) . 
i was really disappointed in these olives the are very mushy and i prefer a more firm texture cat cora 's olives are much , much better . 
i first came across lover 's leap estate tea when buying it from harney sons i enjoyed that tea very much for its flavorful and clean lightness , reminiscent of an afternoon darjeeling the reason i went with the elmwood inn now was that harney only sells this tea in tins and i was n't interested in adding a tin to my collection every time i purchased this tea br br of course i cannot be sure that this is exactly the same tea but i must say that the elmwood inn fell short of my expectations it tastes rather uninteresting and almost flat , and in order to get any kind of recognizable flavor , i have to use plenty of leaves yet it still never achieves any flavor experience that would justify buying this tea over , lets say , loose twinings for much less i will not buy this particular tea again and will continue to search for an equivalent to harney 's lover 's leap . 
have you ever had a great cup of joe from a freshly opened can of gourmet coffee , only to wonder what happened to that 'fresh' taste as you dig deeper into the can \? i have experienced this with other main stream brands but not with 'yuban original' coffee ! the last pot of coffee has always tasted as good as the first one there is also a unique quality to this coffee that i have a fondness for of course , there will always be something 'better' out there , but it 's usually at a higher price though the coffee is consistent , it is the wide price range \( 0 18 0 40 oz \) of this coffee that keeps me at bay with a more cautious 3 stars br br note br with the subscribe save option , you can trim costs and be assured of free shipping previously , i had subscribed to the 33 oz cans right up until the option was discontinued by amazon i have since switched my subscription to this size and updated this review accordingly . 
i 've read the reviews and i agree that yuban is absolutely the best coffee but at 100 for 12 cans comes to over 8 a can that 's 3 more a can than i pay at my local store i do n't understand the high price \? . 
i have never tasted this coffee but when people brew it in my house , it makes my house smell like farts it might taste really good , but i ca n't get over the fart smell you 've been warned . 
the jar is much smaller than i imagined via pictures i thought it was going to be the size of a mason jar , but it was instead much smaller it is spicy though ! lots of jalapeno , not a lot of honey mustard ! . 
these piquillos are packaged in a thin plastic package , though i thought from the picture that they were packed in a roll top tin \( like sardines are packed in \) the peppers that survived the shipping were very good , lightly roasted and with good tangy flavor however , one of the packages was damaged in shipment and leaked red oil all over the rest of the packs , making a huge mess . 
the picture and description was pure butter mini shortbread round , then i decided to order it because i love them so bad but when i got the package , it came out at mini chocolate chip shortbread which i do n't like . 
when habanero is in powder form it does n't taste the same nor does it have the same heat it 's almost physically impossible to get a habanero powder to taste decent go with habanero flakes instead they taste better and pack a lot more heat . 
it 's hard to put a star rating on this i like the crackers a whole lot and think they are super they are hard to find in our local stores and i use amazon a lot for good pricing and hard to locate items however , this purchase experience was a little disappointing the crackers came quickly and in great shape no breakage and the price was fine but , when i opened the first box , i found they had weevils not a huge infestation but still once weevils get a foothold , it 's all over but the shouting i suspect that these boxes have been stored in a southern location as we do n't have weevils up here in the north usually they come up in flour and flour products that originate down south i found them in southern biscuit flour that i bought at one of the discount grocery stores i pop the product in the freezer to kill the weevils and their eggs and then sieve them out gross , but you ca n't save money if you toss everything that does n't meet your approval anyway , ca n't sieve crackers but i'm still tossing them into the freezer for good measure do n't want them to spread to any of my other pantry items this review is just a heads up to anyone buying these on amazon inspect them carefully , pop them in the freezer if in doubt , and enjoy the crackers get a 5 star rating the purchase on amazon gets a 3 star for warehouse storage . 
i have a tried a few of these wasa crisp breads this one was by far the worst it was in essence entirely flavorless it tasted to me the way that i expect that those little packing styrofoam peanuts would taste br br do n't get me wrong it did n't taste bad , hence the 2 stars , it just did n't taste like anything looking for a low cal snack type cracker \? try the wasa sourdough rye crackers now those are heavenly ! . 
wasa crisp'n light inside packaging cannot be recycled the crackerbread is excellent , but its inside packaging is a cellophane or type of plastic that cannot be recycled anywhere in the six states i have contacted todate wasa has not revealed what the inside packaging is made of , nor where i can recycle it . 
i bought crunchies freeze dried organic peas and some other crunchies products in hopes they would be a satisfying , healthy snack for my children both of my kids \( ages 5 and 8 \) gave me the thumbs down on taste , though same reaction to the other dried veggies and even the dried fruits so , my desk at work is now full of crunchies products , and they are a nice quick snack to keep me going between meals i recommend them for this purpose , but i think most kids will probably say no to these products given the flavor of the snacks is ok , not great . 
i'm a huge fan of the mccormick brand gravy mix and i assumed that this would be as good it is n't it 's not bad enough for a 2 but i'm annoyed that i convinced myself to buy a case of this stuff instead of the mccormick . 
this was my first experience of a bad darjeeling before , i had n't known there was such a thing the first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive green the bottom of the cup was invisible the taste was sharp and astringent thinking i 'd brewed too long or too strong , i set the first cup aside and tried again and then again a light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity however , nothing i have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that i associate with lesser teas the wet leaves are the typical size , light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares the aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay neither moldy nor spoiled , just old in contrast , the davidson 's keemun conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious keemun conjou and nothing else br br given the price , i knew i was gamboling and consider this a lost bet i have given the product two stars instead of one , because i have n't thrown it out \( yet \) i keep a supply of lipton 's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment , and i do n't really need more emergency tea perhaps it will work for iced tea br br by no means am i an expert , but i do value tea , and so i hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two darjeelings davidson 's ships quickly with value pricing , and so i am not giving up on the merchant just on this particular darjeeling . 
i bought two kinds of davidson 's bulk teas , darjeeling and gunpowder green , and i was very disappointed in the quality they both make kind of a murky harsh tea the darjeeling is very light in color and has an aftertaste more like pekoe the gunpowder green is weak and flat i certainly would n't recommend them . 
tastes like darjeeling , although , like one of the previous reviewers said , it 's missing some of the body of a good darjeeling i give it 3 stars for taste alone but for the price i paid for it , i guess it 's still a solid deal br br you get what you pay for and for the cost of this tea , i guess it 's good \) . 
the price is right organic tea at a great price , but that 's as far as it goes i 've tried about 5 of the davidsons so far and they just lack character . 
i have never received anything like this from amazon before the product was packed in an old used golf ball box \( bizarre \) the cans were all dented and old looking the bowls were chipped up i thought , oh well , maybe the soup will taste good wrong ! three different flavors but they were all awful , completely inedible all of them were horribly fishy and metallic tasting , the worst canned soups i have ever tasted in my life poured them all out and donated the chipped bowls to charity complete waste of money . 
pros br these are definitely tasty especially when taken from the freezer ! br wheat is not one of their ingredients , so they 're ok for gluten sensitive but non allergic people br br cons br they contain \( less than 2 of \) soy \( lecithin \) which is a state recognized allergen br they contain canola oil which is one of the least healthy oils on the market , devoid of nutrients and chemically processed br br may be a con br they contain palm oil which unless harvested conscientiously \( and more expensively \) significantly contributes to the rainforest destruction e g in indonesia i do n't know how nature valley 's suppliers harvest their palm oil hence the separate may be a con category . 
while the product is delicious , it 's annoying that the peanut butter stays on the waxy paper instead of on the product you need a fork to scrape the peanut butter off the protective top sheet . 
first of all , these things are delicious however , opening them without making a mess is nearly impossible they 're super crumbly , so open the package with care i wo n't buy them again there are too many other good options that are way less messy . 
my cats are not picky eaters , and lick their bowls clean of virtually anything i feed them \( wellness , fussie cat , fancy feast , bff \) i tried feeding them tiki cat on 2 separate occasions , and my cats threw up both times i thought they may have gotten sick the first time from eating something off the floor , but when it happened a second time i was certain it was the tiki cat i'm not sure if i received a bad batch , but i will certainly never be purchasing a tiki cat product again . 
she liked the food a little at first but did n't want much to do with it the price is very high and not worth it if she 'll only eat a couple of bites she had tried most of the flavors and would always have the same reaction . 
this product smells so bad that i could n't even try to consume it it smells sour and rancid and is detectable even before the package was opened the seller has a no return policy so i'm out the i spent on this as it will go right into the garbage . 
i purchased these with the intent to make vanilla extract the bean arrived in a timely manner , and were in a vacuum sealed plastic bag they did n't smell super 'vanilla y' when they arrived , but i can attest that they were soft and pliable maybe too pliable and greasy though almost immediate of being immersed in it 's vodka home , the beans left an oily residue on the top of the glass bottles the grease has not necessarily gotten worse , but it has some type of oily smell that distracts from the richness of the vanilla any one else have this problem \? . 
i have been making wonderful homemade vanilla with a recipe that i found on line using vanilla beans purchased from williams sonoma i decided to try spicy world vanilla beans rather than the much more expensive vanilla beans from williams sonoma two vanilla beans from williams sonoma in a pint of vodka resulted in a very dark richly aromatic vanilla after only two months i used three spicy world vanilla beans in a pint of vodka and after two months i had a liquid that looked like weak tea and had the aroma of alcohol i added three more beans and waited the results were disappointing , so i added three more vanilla beans you can still see through the vanilla and it does n't have the aroma of vanilla i am completely disappointed with the vanilla beans from spicy world they are totally worthless , a complete waste of money i would not recommend them or purchase anything from spicy world . 
i purchased these beans based on other reviews my plan was to make a premium vanilla extract for family members i purchased a very expensive vodka , unusual bottles to fill , and waited for my bean order to arrive i was n't happy about the wait the beans arrived after the 4th , and i rushed to open the package i could not smell the beans as others reported ! most of the beans were skinny shriveled , more dry , and a great disappointment i would not recommend this product i will be looking for another source . 
i received my vanilla beans exactly a month ago today as soon as i opened the package i loved them they were very moist and i was very pleased at the quality of the beans i immediately used 18 of the 50 to make homemade vanilla extract the beans did not come with storage instructions so i googled it and read that i needed to store them in an airtight container i 've used them a few times over the past month for cooking but i still had over half the package left well , when i opened them this evening they were molded i am so very disappointed that i will be unable to use the rest of my beans \( if you 're able to use all 50 as soon as you get them , then i highly recommend these beans if not , then i would look elsewhere , or order a smaller quantity . 
this product had pretty good reviews so i thought it would be safe to buy 4 packages , so i did boy am i full of regret now i'm stuck with 4 packs of these beans and i ca n't return any them the moment i opened the bag , i should 've known it had a stale sour smell to them but the optimistic side of me said , these beans look fresh and plump , maybe it wo n't smell like that once i scrape the seeds out i was wrong i made two test batches to see if it was the salt i was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour , rancid smell i 've made vanilla salt before so i know what it 's supposed to smell and taste like unfortunately , even after a few days , this smell is n't going away i was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts but now i need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me i'm so disappointed i have n't cooked with these seeds so i do n't know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient i know for sure though that if you 're looking to make vanilla extract , vanilla sugar or vanilla salt , i highly discourage you from buying this product . 
true , the beans were huge , moist and plump , with a good mixture of really big fat ones and smaller skinny ones however , the most noticeable aroma coming from the bag and the beans is best described as pungent , with a side of sour is that normal \? ! \? i 've only ever used the crappy dried out grocery store version , and was thrilled when i saw such a good deal on these br br can a vanilla bean expert tell me if that odd , unpleasant aroma is what i'm supposed to be smelling \? \? . 
i do n't really like the chunks of cherry and pistachios i 'd just rather have the plain dark chocolate i think the plain dark is the best dark chocolate sugar free bar available today . 
would have rated no star if available beefeaters chicken liver freeze dried treats for dogs , are a product of china , and irradiated for your protection according to the company 's hold message called amazon com customer service , and requested a full refund with pre paid returned shipping too bad none of this is in the product description amazon csr was very helpful , and very cooperative , postage paid shipping label received via email immediately thank you , amazon com ! . 
anyone see where theses are made \? i am avoiding treats from china because of all the problems lately and i do not see a country of origin here . 
one star given just for possibility that some cats out there may be less \( or different \) picky from ours see my review of cat man doo bonito sprinkles for info on several products i tested in search of a flavor appetite enhancer , including this shrimp version and another f s tuna treat product that was much better received by our gang of four . 
i'm of russian descent and have been eating buckwheat for my entire life i live in the us and usually buy buckwheat in local russian or eastern european stores this is the first \( and last \) time i tried american made buckwheat here are things that i found br 1 it takes only 10 12 min to cook this normally , it takes 25 30 min and this item is not branded as an instant buckwheat br 2 it tastes quite different than usual br 3 there is a strong metallic smell br 4 this item is overpriced just go to the closest russian or eastern european shop and buy the same thing 4 times cheaper . 
i'm drinking oolong tea because dr oz said it would raise metabolism , the jury is still out really how would you know \? i have lost weight but that 's because i quit drinking coffee which i added too much cream to and started working out a lot more it does not taste the all that great so i add 3 equals and drink it after it cools . 
hi , i ordered this product from another website but i wanted to post a review on here since it has the same product br okay first of all the packaging looks nice and neat not messy like others , just pure and simple maybe too simple \? br they dont give the ingredients info which is an automatic fail , on the back it says allergy warning contains soy another fail br they dont tell us what the gum does , does it whiten teeth \? fight bad breath \? or what ! \? you know br br it has the word vitality , which means active but thats all they say nothing more \? br br the taste is like any other gum . 
i really wanted a decaf product so did n't have a lot of options this powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink , even when i use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the base , the chocolate is what you taste when i think of an iced coffee drink , i think of coffee with a hint of chocolate \( mocha \) not the other way around br br as other reviewers point out , the 150 calories is for half the packet and no milk added br br i will try a different brand next time i'm still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor i 've experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop or like the iced blended at a west coast chain \( cb tl \) that is overpriced to have shipped \( and i think is available sugar free \) ! . 
we have used this product before and love it , so decided to send some as a gift to friends the cans were received dented two of the cans were significantly dented the 3 cans were taped together , but no other packaging was in the box one side of the box was torn the shipping receipt was not included nor was the gift message that we had requested our friends had no idea where these 3 beat up looking cans of walnut oil came from or who sent them until we called and asked if they had received them shipping was also suppose to be in 2 3 days was not received until day 6 will find another way to purchase this product , but not through amazon . 
i found the oil a bit weak in taste i had expected a stronger walnut flavor i hope it is not chemically produced like most truffle oils . 
i really wanted to like this , as it was organic , and came in a glass bottle , but there was hardly any flavor at all i could barely smell it , and even when i poured a generous amount on my dish , it imparts little to no truffle flavor aroma my truffle salt is much more potent . 
this was not good the flavor was lacking and barely came through unlike the hint water which i really enjoy i wanted this to be good and was so excited to get it but it just disappointed . 
personal preference too sweet tastes like general foods international coffees price is great if you like that , though and makes up very easy . 
this product was okay tasting my problem with it was the 10 oz container with less than 6 oz of sprinkles really \? ! \? . 
i love taco bell 's grocery items , so i was excited to try this new rice unfortunately , it was disappointing this is more of an imitation spanish rice than a mexican rice it is tomato based , and very sweet i expected it to have more of a taco type seasoning \( cumin , garlic , etc \) i cooked the rice for the recommended amount of time \( 90 seconds \) and this came out very mushy and sticky , mostly clumping together the flavor was too much for me , since i do not like sweet rice with my tacos i would not try this again , and i would be hesitant to try another flavor . 
the oatmeal inside the canisters was good however , the packaging by amazon was terrible every single can arrived dented , and several of the cans popped open amazon treats products terribly i have n't ordered from amazon in a long time , not since they sent me expired pirate 's booty , which i tossed i thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try what a mistake never again customer service at amazon leaves much to be desired , as well if you get someone , they 'll probably speak broken english and be very hard to understand then they will not understand the problem you 'll have to ask for a supervisor who , you hope , will speak better english be prepared to wait a long time for a supervisor , and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor the supervisor will ask for every piece of identification imaginable , not short of your ssn , before saying , well , what do you want me to do \? uh , you 're customer service service the customer \? \? \? amazon has lost my business forever . 
my baby enjoyed this flavor when i purchased it at a store i ordered a case of it from amazon the whole case arrived moldy each jar popped when i opened it too , showing that it was properly sealed i contacted earth 's best they said they would look into it but would not follow up with me given what is going on in our food industry , i will not purchase any more products from this company it is to scary when feeding a baby amazon refunded me but did not take it any further be very careful and inform other families too update i was so disappointed with the lack of concern from earth 's best and amazon i contacted the fda , they referred me to the usda because the product contained meat they took it very serious and had also received several complaints they have come to my house and written a report if anyone else noticed this problem please contact the usda \( 1 888 674 6854 \) br to report your claim problem they will investigate the problem and the earth 's best plant to make sure they are following regulations . 
i tested this one on my twin 10 month old babies and they liked it immediately it was their first beef and their first spinach i had already given them chicken and they really like it so they are not vegetarians yet anyway mostly i wanted this product for the spinach and the higher iron content somehow they made this particular flavor brand tasty for babies br br i like getting these by the case rather than buying them a jar at a time at the store since 2 babies eat so much it 's good to keep several flavor brands around too i think , to give your baby a variety i'm sure i 'll get another case when this one is finished br br ingredients per the label water , organic carrots , organic finely ground beef , organic spinach , organic garbanzo bean flour , organic tomato paste , organic whole durum wheat flour contains wheat br br this has 110 calories , 31 protein , 100 vitamin a , 8 vitamin c , 4 calcium and 4 iron i 've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult .

i ordered a flat of food \( they were on sale \) that contained chicken apple compote dinner it contained 3 of this variety and he liked the first one but the others , although properly sealed , were solid and moldy and stinky br one of the turkey dinners in the flat was also improperly sealed the lid popped we were lucky because i just happened to check that one now i'm so paranoid that i check all of them several times i called earth 's best and they assured me that they have n't had this problem before and that i should n't worry about it i'm so suprised that this got passed qa qc inspection at a baby food manufacturer why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety \? ! br br we also recently opened 5 other jars in this flat after my son refused to eat them and realized that they were rotten 3 of them were completely solid and domed at the top ! we poked a toothpick down to the bottom of the jar and it was dry throughout shortly after eating his last dinner of this box , my son started vomiting and refused to eat we have contacted the usda about this if this happens to you , please same your jars so you can give them the information they need it may prevent other babies from getting sick br i 'll never buy anything from earth 's best again ! . 
i do n't think it 's eb , i think it 's amazon i buy eb from babies r us , target and whole foods , and have n't had any problems it 's only the shipments from amazon that come moldy . 
when i saw some of the earth 's best jars offered as a gold box deal , i remembered that i needed to offer a caveat to other parents br my children have previously enjoyed many earth 's best flavors , which in general taste quite good , so in february when there was a promotional offer through amazon , we ordered two 12 packs when they arrived , one of the 12 packs seemed ok , but the other 12 pack contained several broken jars and was leaking it smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12 pack br i noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12 packs had air filled padding on only the top side of the box , which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side br i do n't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery , but either way , i was afraid to use the unbroken jars too , because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too \? br for more durable items , i still order from amazon , but i canceled my subscription of the earth 's best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where i can check them first . 
i also ordered a flat of food \( they were on sale \) that contained the turkey and wild rice dinner one of them was also improperly sealed the lid popped we were lucky because i just happened to check that one now i'm so paranoid that i check all of them several times i called earth 's best and they assured me that they have n't had this problem before and that i should n't worry about it i'm so suprised that this got passed qa qc inspection at a baby food manufacturer why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety \? ! . 
we had the same issue with this product half the flat was improperly sealed , and resulted in an expired food issue but you can spot the unsafe jars because they have dried up turned solid , resulting in a different sound when shaken also , when opened , these bad jars are mounded up in the middle and have a rotten smell it may be that the product was frozen in shipping , and the expansion caused the seal to break i have requested a refund from amazon br br our baby did love this meal though it was like thanksgiving dinner the ones that were still edible were delicious , and are one of his favorite foods . 
my daughter thinks this tastes nasty , and i agree she is sensitive to carrot , so i was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but does n't contain carrot though she eats homemade turkey and peas all the time , she would n't even take a full bite of this i tasted a little bit , and i can see why . 
i 've read other reviewers comment on the calorie content of this flavor and it must be high because when i was trying to wash the dish i served it in in was quite oily also , it has a bit of a grainy texture and i think my 6 month old son finds the spinach a little difficult to digest . 
i was looking for another dinner to try and decided to spend the extra money on this one i thought my son loves chicken and mangos so why not this he is not a fan he will suffer through half a jar , but will not finish a whole one i guess it was a little too exotic for his 9 month old taste buds we will keep trying br br he loves , loves , loves the beef and spinach and will almost cry when the jar is gone . 
this was not a hit ! it 's bitter , like maybe the carrots were not sweet and or not peeled \? and the main ingredient is carrots ! \( amazon should include the ingredients for all items \) quality control seems to be an issue this is the second gourmet meal flavor with this issue i had never had a bad experience with the eb products before , very disappointing . 
my girls seem to like this food they 've only ever shown an opposition to green beans but it is so messy it 's apparently tomato based , and it gets everywhere where we usually just wipe their faces gently , you really have to clean them it simply turns their skin orange and the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily , even after soaking . 
my 9 mo old daughter only eats earth 's best products and loves all of them that is , except this i ca n't figure out what it is , but we finally concluded that it smells a little like catfood i tried feeding her this mango chicken flavor a few different times and she would only eat a few bites i gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone else 's child would like it i have had a good experience with the subscribe and save products in general , no broken jars and the quick delivery is great i find that it is cheaper than whole foods \( even with the coupons \) this is the only flavor of earth 's best baby food that my daughter dislikes for what it 's worth , i suggest skipping this one or trying it in a variety pack first . 
earth 's best is supposed to be one of the best baby foods , but apparently my son does not have a palate for their food maybe he did not like the texture of this stuff \( it looks gritty \) he normally eats anything but was very sluggish with this food turning his head after a couple of bites . 
it was bad before we open them i saw them when we got i did open it had some spot green color i did not know what it was i was very upset do not buy this product .

this is for puppies the bag is super small ! ! ! the bag did n't last more than a day i thought it was funny when i got the bag i thought it was a gift to be honest ! ! ! . 
my dogs really did not care for these were not real p nutty . 
i bought these for my wife for her birthday , she loves chocolate and its a staple gift i give her well this year i got her these she only ate one , and put them away very strange later i caught her putting them in the garbage when i tried one i quickly realized why , they taste like they have no sugar in them , and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast i had to brush my teeth to get the taste out we had a good laugh about it fortunately i also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they did n't ruin her birthday 43 dollars wasted . 
i purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks it has very little 'coffee' taste , and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking br br i will not be purchasing this coffee again my suggestion to those considering a purchase buy something else . 
i am big coffee lover this was some of the worst coffee i have ever had it smells wonderful but the taste is horrible i would not recommend purchasing this coffee at all . 
i have a one one coffee pod machine and have ordered pods online before these looked good and sounded like high quality coffee albeit a little pricey for 12 pods this was the worst cup of coffee i have ever tasted ! it left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for hours yuck ! do n't be fooled by the fancy name and packaging it tastes like rocket fuel fortunately , amazon refunded my money when i explained how bad it was throwing the whole box away ! . 
several of the seller 's listings indicate 20 kona blend but the delivered product does not have this package printing br as a long time kona coffee drinker , the contents are more indicative of 10 \( or less \) kona coffee have ordered twice and completely disappointed . 
received the shipment promptly but to my dismay , it did not contain the mini treats i had ordered , but small , which were not that small i have very small dogs and i really wanted the minis i contacted the seller \( petco \) and after several days , they responded that i could return them but if i reordered minis , they would still send the small because amazon had the item numbers wrong and they do n't have minis they said the simplest thing would be to return them for credit this did not seem economically feasible , so i am breaking each one into small pieces which is very inconvenient . 
it definitely smells like dark chocolate but the taste is just average i ca n't say i taste the dark chocolate decadence and it 's not that strong but usually i like stronger tasting coffee . 
you have to put a lot of sugar in this to make it taste good the coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a poopy diaper or a pee pee poo poo puppy in a cup next time i am going for raspberry flavored coffee cause the chocolate is like poop yuck . 
have had this gum from other sources and always liked it this particular shipment seems to have much less peppermint flavor than before could be it is older gum \( there is no expiration date on it \) or they are making it with less peppermint now otherwise i received this order very quickly . 
the advertised regular price of 99 99 is ridiculous 5 hour energy drinks are widely available for 2 00 each do n't buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts you can get a case of 12 for 20 right here on amazon . 
this is a great price , but every time i 've bought these through amazon , the bottles frequently have dark stuff on the threads of the bottle when you open it i 've never seen this when buying them from the local drugstore , so i worry that these are either old or maybe not authentic \? br br ca n't say for sure of course they do have the desired effect , so i'm not complaining too much it 's kind of gross sometimes though . 
i took it at 5am yesterday it is now almost 3am the next day and i am laying in bed and skin feels tingly , ca n't sleep at all i feel like i am at super sayan level 4 , power of the red monkey i could shoot ki blast out the window if i wanted too maybe some kame hame wave 's too . 
i bought this bag and found it 50 cheaper at smart and final it was also old and and white this was terrible ! i bought it to put in the candy canisters i give to co workers so i did n't find out it was old till a co worker informed me i was so embarrassed do not buy this candy it all ended up in the trash very disappointed ! . 
this candy was obviously old each chocolate was discolored the krackel krispies were not crispy and the chocolate was n't right peant butter cups and goodbars nasty , the nuts are horrible hersheys pulls their candy off of the shelves in the stores when it is getting old seller must have bought it up sold it here last year or the year before it has to be at least 1 or more years old do not buy chocolate from zany values , it is n't good for you ! ! br br i'm sure that if the candy were fresh that it would have been just fine i have re ordered from a different vendor and will let you know if theirs is fresh \( as it should be \) or not . 
i did not expect this hot chocolate to be quite as sweet as i found it to be it also has more calories than previous ghiradelli similar hot chocolate br it has a rich taste and if i were not concerned with weight i would overlook the higher calories . 
i do n't know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about i tried ghiraradelli 's premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable and not a very chocolatey taste either the directions given for one serving are 4 tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk did they meant 4 tsp \? using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa not very economical for a product with so much sugar i had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed . 
very bitter ! i could n't taste the coffee at all it basically tastes like baking cocoa no sweetness , no richness , not coffee i bought the 4 pack though , so i 've begun mixing it half and half with swiss miss \( in the can \) , and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after i 've made a cup even making it with whole milk could n't make this yummy by itself if you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee shop elsewhere . 
having liked the various types of ghirardelli chocolate and premium hot cocoa 's i decided to try some ghirardelli chocolate premium hot cocoa mix , chocolate mocha after trying several cups of this i started to wonder what happened to the ghirardelli chocolate as myself i thought it was overpowered with the coffee taste not my cup of hot cocoa ! ! . 
i love hot cocoa and hot chocolate and have tried many different brands br br ghiradelli is by far the worst that i have ever tasted ! i honestly do n't have any idea how they ever became famous for their hot cocoa br br this cocoa has an awful , stale taste and you can tell that it is made of cheap ingredients br br it even tastes worse than the much lower cost brands like swiss miss and nestle br br if you want a real hot chocolate , look up marie belle it is thick and rich not weirdly processed garbage like ghiradelli ! ! ! . 
the chocolate mocha flavor of this hot cocoa is really nice it 's different from the usual hot cocoa since it has a hint of coffee the quality is definitely there , i find it to be better then the godiva brand mixes extremely easily , there is no residue and works with milk or even water mixed with half and half i must say that it is a bit much of the same flavor , i would have rather 4 different flavors since the containers are big worth it though ! a . 
not really sure what i expected , but since i like ghirardelli chocolate , and i like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops , i thought i 'd like this product br br unfortunately , despite following the directions and making this in milk , it 's not as rich and satifying as i hoped i hate to say it , but i think swiss miss mixed instant coffee tastes better than this br br that 's unfortunate , because this is a four pack of cannisters and i'm only half way through the first one ! . 
love the contents , but two of eight containers were badly dented br br jan . 
i bought this product and when it arrived it was not organic beware ! the package shown in the photo is not an organic product . 
so anyways , i wished that i could find ginseng tea more easier , but for the price excluding the shipping i suppose its allright comes in a weird form , not powder kinda like small bits of grass taste fine not sour or sweet . 
this was a christmas present for my son in law who collects super hero stuff he was surprised but really liked it . 
the pack of six bottles was delivered in a timely manner but when i opened up a bottle , the juice tasted sour i thought that it had spoiled in transit and considered returning the remaining bottles but then i noticed the very bottom line on the product label , enriched with organic lemon juice it was too much trouble to return and , while i do not totally enjoy the tartness that the lemon juice adds , it is at least still pure and organic and healthy br br i would not have ordered the product had i known that it was not just carrot juice but carrot juice with organic lemon juice added to it perhaps this is why the price is so very right but i feel misled br br it takes some getting used to if you are seeking the taste of carrot juice before you order this item , i would suggest you buy a small bottle of carrot juice and squeeze some lemon juice into it to preview the effect of having lemon juice flavored carrot juice . 
my recommendation \? get a juicer and make your own , or try odwalla the taste was bitter , and the smell was strange and foul the label says enriched with organic lemon juice and that is not pure carrot juice in my book maybe it was the lemon i tasted , i do n't know i had about three sips and could n't stomach it . 
talk about horrible br i was craving carrot juice and the store was out of the brand i normally like which has what i like for ingredients carrot juice br br i did see before buying that it said it had organic lemon juice in it when i looked at the ingredients but i figured that the makers would only add it if it did n't change the taste that much well all i have to say is i taste no semblance of carrots at all it tasted more like drinking a bad v 8 or something then after sipping a couple of ounces i now have an acid reflux feeling in my throat and chest i drink water with lemon pretty often and never have that happen so now i'm wondering exactly how much lemon juice is in here br br if you want carrot juice this is not for you i do n't even think they should call it that br br i do n't normally do it , but i am seriously considering taking this back to the supermarket i also think i should write a letter to the company because it is just that ridiculously bad . 
i tried this carrot juice for the first time today and regret buying it i took my first sip and actually wondered if someone had put pickle juice in the jar it was awful i 've had several carrot juices and never had any as sour as this it is difficult to fathom how this product is still produced it has lemon juice in it , but apparently far far too much if you enjoy pickle juice with your carrot juice , you will love this product i do n't . 
i do n't know how they did it but this is by far the worst tasting carrot juice i have ever had i think it has to do with the long shelf life expires in 2012 , i drank it in 2010 \( well i tried to drink it \) it was probably bottled in 2007 or something br br yyeecchh ! ! . 
first indiana jones found the lost ark of the covenant , then the mystical stone from the temple of doom , then the holy grail and finally the palace of the crystal skull but the loser still cant find the lost lakewood bottle of real , honest 100 pure carrot juice minus lemons not without short round anyway br br i tried to leave no stars or fewer cuz , i felt and tasted the pain of other misguided customers , i spewed out my first rancid acidic taste of this clearly labeled , pure carrot juice lakewood 's knucklehead faux pas is their troglodytian approach to the label design i can easily read pure carrot and pure again , just above the illustration of carrots only \( but nada lemons \) , but in much smaller print at the very bottom of the label and below the carrots only illustration \( sans lemons \) , it mentions enriched with lemons , 1 to be exact , which means 99 of their marketing team make o'donnell look constitutionally wise br br intentional or not , it aint the keenest marketing approach to thinking consumers to paraphrase a wiser woman , you might want to rethink those ties \( labels in this case \) e brockovich even juicy juice was smart enough to clear up their ambiguously labeled products today 's mcfly fyi and word of the day is pure , and brought to you from my sponsor , merriam webster pure unmixed with any other matter as in gold , pure gold , jerry \( i watch tv and commercials , does it show \? \) br br for an amazing ride courtesy of the short bus marketing team see the label here br http www amazon com lakewood organic pure carrot juice dp b0000zshak br click on the photo and zoom in to find the 1 of einsteinian logic or lack there of finding the pure bs or at least 99 9 requires no zoom , matter of fact arms length , like in a grocery store aisle is close enough to be misdirected br br ok lakewood , so , think what you will about my criticism be it glib , harsh , frank , curt or possibly even unfair or totally wrong on the other hand , i think not but i would love to be proven wrong are you game for a little challenge get three 3rd graders , heck even three 3 year olds and give them each 3 crayons , green , yellow and orange now ask them to draw a picture for the label of juice which contains , carrots and lemons or if your brave enough for a real acid test , lemons and carrots all i am saying , is give 3 's a chance ! in a world of scams , rip offs and misconceptions and misdirection be honest and be excellent to one another br br no hard feelings , right \? br br ret hink aka curt frank aka bombastic sarcastic b 5t rd . 
been waiting for this to be shipped for over 30 days might be ok hard to tell unless they send it . 
i bought this molasses at a local grocery store and nowhere on the bottle does it state that it is , 'unsulphered' i called the company and talked to a sales rep in which he stated that it was not unsulphered although it does have a higher percentage of iron , i'm going back to plantation . 
this stuff does not taste like black licorice or sweet in any way to me it tastes kind of like thick , nasty soy sauce i ca n't see how anyone could take 3 tablespoons a week of this i barely managed to swallow the teaspoon i put in my mouth we eat very healthy and not much sugar but my tastebuds say no way ! to this stuff it does have 70 of your daily iron so i will make some attempts to hide this in something else though i really ca n't imagine what right now br br in addition , the cap was not on tightly when the package arrived and the black goo had leaked out into into the packaging they did have it wrapped securely in bubble wrap though , so it only got on that still , not pleasant to have to clean the container before i could open it . 
the shipping was very prompt and the packaging excellent all other items in this order were excellent these were lollipops shaped and painted like flamingos but you have to hold them up close to the eye to figure out what they are ! they 'll be ok to set out on the candy buffet , but they wo n't be the eye catching item we 'd anticipated when we ordered . 
i thought the whole figs would be softer for spreading but they are not you have figs laying in a very sweet syrup i 've only tried it on toast one time and it was way to sweet to eat the figs just lay on top unspreadable i would not buy again save your money . 
the first ingredient is vinegar anyone who uses hot sauce religiously should understand what that means i read the other reviews and was expecting a hell of a lot more than what i got it 's got a good flavor to it , but it 's just a few steps above tabasco from what the other reviewers described , it seems this product has a lot of variability in heat , which means it 's going to have a lot of variability in quality the bottle i got is really tame , far , far below my dave 's ghost pepper , dave 's ultimate insanity , blair 's after death , da bomb beyond insanity , da bomb ground zero , professor phardtpounder 's colon cleanser , it 's a lacking sauce hell , sriracha is hotter than this if you get lucky and get a hot bottle , congrats i use mine liberally on cheap pizza , because that 's all it 's good for . 
it is definatly not 4 , 000 , 000 half the heat of daves ghost sauce , maybe weaker may be a good dipping sauce . 
has a good taste it is a lil hott not 2 bad maybe just a lil less hotter than blaires ultra death sauces but has a better flavor . 
i ordered this glitter based on the fact it advertised it was edible i would n't even try to feed this to anyone let alone on a cake for children ! i read several reviews and they all said how fantastic it was so i purchased on good faith when it arrived i wanted to see if it had a taste it tastes like i assume craft glitter would taste i packaged it to send it back but did n't if you want a trust worthy edible glitter , stick with wilton products . 
if i could give this food a zero i would i tried it out and the dogs loved it until they all had the runs for 2 days it was horrible , smelled bad , and i would never get it again ! . 
i bought the kit to dabble in spherification the item is as described and arrived on time my complaint is that the instructions measure the required chemicals in fractions of grams my kitchen scale measures as low as 1 gram but does not do fractions of grams i cannot find a kitchen scale that measures fractions of grams therefore i find the kit difficult to use i would not recommend the kit because it requires the purchase of specialized scale that can measure tenths of grams . 
not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies , more on the sweet side coconut is listed in the ingredients , but you certainly wo n't taste it my son liked them , so they wo n't go to waste i would not buy them again . 
this is the new dublin dr pepper now bottled in temple texas this is produced after dr pepper force dublin out of production it is not the same as dublin dr pepper , that is why it is so cheap if you want the real thing , you 'll pay more for it . 
i received my 2 cases of rice works and the chips are awesome tasting and a great price but in every single bag \( 24 \) the chips were crunched smashed into little pieces so i guess i have 24 bags of salad toppers or but not chips . 
i tried these chips on a whim while shopping at costco they stopped carrying the chips and i had to look elsewhere for these delicious snacks no local store carried them , so i turned to amazon com in hopes of finding them as soon as i discovered them on the list of foods carried by amazon , i ordered a box br when the box of chips arrived , i opened a bag of the riceworks salasa fresca chips , only to find not a single whole chip the largest chip was no more than a quarter the size of a whole chip it was impossible to use them to dip with i hoped that was just an isolated bag of the product , but , most of the bags had similarly damaged chips on average there were only a couple of whole chips to each bag br it was very disappointing to have a great slasa style chip reduced to rubble during shipping because of the condition of the chips upon arrival , i will not buy them from amazon com again br great chips when they are whole a great disappointment when they are reduced to crumbled pieces . 
i have tried all of the riceworks chips except for the sesame soy which i plan to try soon i have a un opened bag still so far prefer the sweet chile chips these chips are pretty healthy as far as chips go made from brown rice and pop when chewed on i bought them top food 's here in washington state costco has the larger 16oz bag in the sweet chile flavor only price was 2 99 at top foods for 5 5oz size 2 88 on amazon for same size br costco was 4 99 for the 16oz size . 
the chips are awesome i first bought them at costco and now i cannot get them there any more the bags at costco were about 3 times larger than the one i recieved from amazon the arrived mostly in tiny crumbles of chips and the bags were about 1 3 full i wo n't waste my money buying them from amazon again as the shipping is just not up to par if you can find the chips retail i would advise buying them that way their website says that super target and costco carries them but have not been able to find them there recently . 
i am constantly looking for gluten free foods that i might enjoy for health reasons , i was excited to see these in my local store not only need you be concerned just with the msg and soy protein , be aware of the weight in the packages the bags purchased stated 5 5 oz one seemed to be much lighter than the other when i got them home , i put them in zip lock bags to check the contents the bag that had seemed very light compared to the others was indeed less than a third of the amount in the other bags it was no more than a very small handful it did not contain crushed or broken chips , it contained very few chips this is not the time for corporations who want to succeed and grow to cheat consumers ! is this a growing trend \? i find it so . 
these things are like eating poker chips with seasoning salt they 're remarkably high in calories , too ! . 
the only other flavored coffee i 've used was nestle hazelnut it too was a 5 whole bean i really enjoyed that one and thought i pick this one up br br where the nestle 's shared flavor with the bean this one overpowers this one has a burnt note that seems flavoring instead of roast related i like hazelnuts and this a is n't anything like hazelnut br br now i have 5 of the stuff my mistake ! br br more info br i am about 3 4 of the way through the bag my opinion has not changed also , i would note a very inconsistent flavor today 's grind seems almost devoid of the flavoring it appears they really do n't have the adding of flavoring down the intensity of the flavoring is all over the park . 
this is not a deeply roasted or rich tasting coffee at all it 's very light , with unevenly sized beans clearly a blend some beans are normal size and some are tiny the hazelnut aroma and flavor is good , but this coffee is not strong at all even using twice as many grounds , i could not get enough coffee flavor from these beans br br people who like very weak coffee will probably love this people who like starbucks will not like this one bit . 
this cake always turns out consistently sweet and moist , but bland compared to the new deluxe duncan hines version of german chocolate cake , this is not impressive it will do when you 're craving something different from regular chocolate cake , though . 
it tastes like jack links brand , not wild bill 's even the texture is totally different from wild bill 's not recommended ! . 
i blame myself for trying to save a buck this coffee is way too weak for my tastebuds they say it 's a dark blend but it 's not even close to a dark roast i buy at stores in the end , i have blend each can with a pound of dark roast and it 's ok . 
if you like a rich dark coffee , this product is not for you ! we 'd been looking for an organic alternative , and i 've tried some great ones , so we ordered this when it was on special unfortunately , we ordered 6 cans to get the discount , and now we are stuck with organic , but very dull tasting coffee to make the best of it , we 've bought other tried and true rich dark brands to mix with it very disappointing ! . 
i bought this along with the regular dark roast at a considerable discounted price well lets just say you get what you pay for the flavor really is not there and this as well is not much of a dark roast . 
i prefer rich , strong coffee and this product is a bit bland for my taste . 
chewy lemonhead and friends are my favorite candy period i love them so much br \( cough \) br so when i found these i was really excited and bought a pack hoping they 'd have that same tartness that makes lemonhead and friends so good ! br nope tasted just like every other jelly gummy type candy i was very let down it was okay for jelly gummy , but do n't expect much . 
so so there was great reviews on product only made it once will try it again . 
i'm recently widowed so have to learn to fix for a single person i hoped this microwaveable bowl of beefaroni would provide a tasty lunch to my surprise , i found that it was nearly all macaroni , with some tomato sauce and a very small amount of beef the taste was ok if you like macaroni and a rather strong tomato sauce , but i expected more beef also , as with so many canned food these days , be prepared for a high dose of sodium salt , that is 31 of average daily requirement in one small serving overall , no so good . 
when the flowers showed up , they were in pretty bad shape i figured that water and the provided plant food would spruce them up within a few days did n't happen they went from being dull and wilted to being dead within four days of arrival . 
i got this product ship one day express unfortunately , when it arrived and i opened it , all i saw was a big blob of melted chocolate with little macadamia nuts in the center of the holders . 
i only use c h bakers sugar for all my baking needs and i go through it fast with a lot of baking i looked on amazon to see if i could purchase it in a case for ease and cost savings at the grocery store , one 4lb carton costs less than 5 , so to get three of them , it would cost 15 or less here on amazon it is 28 plus 12 shipping that totals 40 for a 15 product yep , that 's almost 3 times more expensive than if i just purchase it at the local grocery store i love amazon and was really shocked to see this price this is a definite no thanks , i know better than to purchase this item here ! . 
too soft i just used this sugar to bake one of the layers for a firm pound cake like layer cake intended for decoration \( wilton butter cake recipe \) this is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well i had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before i ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar be forewarned , this sugar makes cakes far too tender the layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release even when i was mixing the batter , it for some reason stuck to my stainless bowl and was impossible to scrape entirely out i'm sure this is good for meringues and such , but i would never attempt to use it again for a cake or even cookies you would never get them out of or off the pan . 
very crunchy and salty , just like described i can also tell they use a lot of artificial color not the best caviar might be really good for sushi ! . 
the seeds are fresh , the shells are hard and the seeds are jumbo sized the taste is good , but the over powering amount of salt ruins the experience the 'ranch' flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened then again , without the overwhelming amount of salt , david might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying by the way , i do n't often find items too salty , but this borders on the ridiculous , imo i wholeheartedly endorse the jumbo size seeds , as they are much more enjoyable than the puny 'regular' sized sunflower seeds by david br br i will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future , hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the david 's have br br update i finished all but a little of the case of david buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds i compared them back to back the jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to david 's it will be interesting how i will find the jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile right now , they seem a bit 'under flavored' still , that is preferable to david 's overuse of salt . 
i could n't really taste the bergamot in this tea it had more of a slight orange peel taste since it is organic , i expected a cleaner , richer taste it 's ok , but not as good as the regular twinings earl grey i have had other brands of organic that were superior to either of the twinings , but at a much higher price . 
my two cats used to love this formula , but i guess they got tired of it , or maybe the formula was changed i only feed it occasionally now . 
the description of the item is small pieces , diced i would call them chopped they 're basically what you 'd find on a banana split or a sundae or perhaps decorating a chocolate cake or cupcake i like the toasted flavor and put them on oatmeal they do not come in a sealed package as shown in the photo mine came in a folded over plastic bag inside a cardboard box . 
i was drawn to this product because it 's called a feast , but i was somewhat put off by it being a fancy feast my cat certainly deserves a feast ! i mean , he runs himself ragged from morning till night going after mice and by the end of the day he 's bushed and frustrated too , since i had him declawed and all but he do n't need anything fancy , that 's for sure i just want him to enjoy a cat feast and leave it at that he 's not one of them cat 's that prances around with his bushy tail waving around like some lady feline i know my tubby toughie would be in cat heaven if they changed the name to fighter feast or beastly feast so , i'm giving this product 3 stars five stars because it 's a pretty great feast , minus three stars because the name offends tubby toughie , and plus one star because i like to lick the can . 
the product is a good value for the amount you get , however it is way too salty the product is very dry and firm i think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half . 
i'm really disappointed with the changes in quality it 's not even the same product that we used to love a couple of years ago , the product was consistently fantastic , but now the taste , quality of the meat , and freshness are hit or miss and recently it 's all been a miss . 
i purchased the wood smoked flavor the reviewers who said that these are too salty were right they tastes like sticks of salts if you nibble on them very slowly , then they tastes ok as the salts disolve slowly if you take a big bite , then it would be like biting into a chunk of salt i love the texture and the stringiness of this beef jerky but i would not buy it again because of the high sodium content . 
this beef jerky is extremely salty i tried the wood smoked flavor , and i figured people were just being a bit picky however , it really is overpowering and although it has a decent smoky flavor the salt is just way too much the container says 570mg sodium or 24 of daily value for one serving i would recommend trying a different product . 
i love all different types of beef jerky , but not this one it has the flavor of grocery store bought beef jerky once you get over the overwhelming taste of salt these sticks are cut thin making them tender and easy to chew , but they 're just way too salty and definitely not worth 20 . 
i read the reviews and thought , i like salt i thought the saltiness was on the exterior of the jerky there is very little salt taste on the outside of the jerky but the saltiness comes out with every chew the strips are about the size of a chopstick or a very thin pencil 12 ounces for 20 is way too expensive there is very little beef flavor but too be fair it is probably covered up by the salt these taste very similar to the chopped and formed cheap jerky at the convenience mart that you swear you will never buy again but much more salty the amount of salt made my tongue numb , if you want good jerky keep looking \( jack link 's smokehouse beef jerky strips , wood smoked 30 count jar \) . 
the jack link 's 30 jerky strips were verrrryyyy skinny ! some were only about 1 8 inch wide and counted as one strip if i had known this , i would not have ordered the beef jerky strips tasty , but totally not worth the money ! ! ! ! . 
too salty enough said i order the wood smoked 30 count jar remember , the price is for only one jar \( not two \) . 
was hoping that the pieces would be a bit flatter in structure , but they shy away from sausage stick territory fine enough flavor was n't bad , but nothing to write home about i'm just glad they were n't that greasy . 
i like almost everything about this jerky , the toughness and chewiness but it is just too salty if you nibble it , you may enjoy it but that is not how i eat also , it is not good for my health to eat something this salty i have run into too many of salty beef jerky patches recently this review is for the wood smoked , but if other flavors contains the same amount of salt per serving , they will be just as salty why everything is either too fatty , sweet or salty \? \? \? are they trying to get us addicted \? . 
i buy jerky all the time , always willing to try something new i 've even made my own at home i agree with the review that called these salt sticks , they are way too salty for my taste also , being a jerky eater for 40 years , i eat it because i like the toughness and chewiness of jerk but the tube i got was nearly un chewable i have bit into some hard jerky in my time , but jeez louise , these were literally like chewing leather , many of the strips would not yield to my super powered bite . 
this is a good name and a good value the texture and size of the jerky is fine , br but be prepared for the salt it ruined it for me . 
wow the hickory smoked jerkey sticks were incredibly salty i could not even eat half of the stick i have had 3 different people try them and they had the same problem they are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth avoid these at all costs . 
first time ordering this jerky from amazon , and i highly recommend to everyone do not buy it ! it is harder than a rock i have bought it from other sellers not amazon , and it is much better the experation date is not for another year , but you cannot even bite it or chew it horrible , i think its the worst jerky ive ever bought ! . 
i do n't eat beef jerky , and i wanted to buy some for a christmas gift i read all of the reviews at amazon com and decided that jack links would be the best purchase it came nicely packaged , but there is liquid in the packaging a lot of it if you turn the packaging upside down , the movement of the liquid is obvious so now i have to pay to return soupy beef jerky and buy a different type br br three days since my original review amazon cannot accept returns of food items , so it kindly replaced the beef jerky the replacement also has liquid in it it 's not fat , but a liquid as described above this time , i'm asking for a refund . 
i buy jack links peppered jerky every month i tried these as this was the first time seeing them do n't waste your money they are so tough even the kids wouldnt eat them ! ! they do not taste anything like the other peppered jerkys stick with the 1 oz or the 2 oz sticks they are moist and not so much grizzle . 
this is the worst jerky i have ever tasted it is not edible , i actually gave it to my dog and he spit it out i kid you not do n't buy this product unless you are a bar owner and want your customers to guzzle beers to put out the salty fire that is created when you eat a small bite of this crap ! ! ! i deserve a refund for buying this dog food oh excuse me i forgot even my dog wo n't eat it \) . 
i did not realize when i decided to purchase these that they were boxed and because of that i found them stale and hard i had previously purchased these at a local store who packaged them in plastic and they were soft and fresh sorry that i could not give these a better review . 
i honestly cannot say that i saw any difference whatsoever in this variety compared to friskies regular sliced beef version actually , my cat preferred the regular friskies over this one he 's not really all that jazzed over these fancy feast varieties anyway , so if you 're going to buy this one or the chicken , save your money and buy the regular friskies versions they seem to taste better to the cat and it saves you money i 've never had a cat that ever got too thrilled over this variety over the years so i guess i 'll get the special ones instead . 
i have n't had a cat yet that liked this one it 's just a little too interesting for them i think it smells nasty but i think it 's just the taste that really gets them my current cat just wo n't touch it he might eat a couple of bites if he 's really hungry , but i always wind up throwing it out this one is ground so if your cat likes pieces , do n't try this one . 
this says 4 pack so i assumed like other purchases that i made that it was 4 boxes each with 4 packs big mistake ! you only get four little pouches who would pay over 2 for a little squirt of applesauce \? do n't make the same mistake buy elsewhere . 
once or twice a year for a little variety and that 's about enough for my cat of this particular variety he likes it for a change from his chicken , turkey and beef , but not very often he will eat about 3 4 of the can and then he 's had enough he 's not a huge fish fan anyway , but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties the chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does , it will be easier to chew do n't know why my cat does n't like this type of fish , but he really could care less about it . 
i honestly have to say that i just wo n't buy this variety it looks bad , smells bad and i'm sure tastes bad because my cat wo n't touch it no way , no how , wo n't even look at it my other cat was the same way with this one it just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market i'm sure some cats must like it because it 's still being made , but there 's other things out there much , much better than this one . 
instead of a black graduation cap , a top hat was sent instead not great for a graduation gift ! also , i think any buyer should be aware that by godiva 4 pack , they mean 4 pieces of candy ! very confusing description especially when you consider that the picture shows at least 5 pieces of candy ! definitely not worth the price ! ! . 
these little taffy 's are expensive i think i paid around 11 for the pound they taste good , but man do they give me gas after eating about 3 my stomach would be rumbling for a few hours and i would have to pass gas a lot my girlfriend would n't let me eat them before bed hahaha there was never any pain involved , just gas i know it was these doing it because we tested it over a few different days i would n't eat the taffy some days and would be fine all it took was a few pieces and an hour late the bubble guts would start br br this information may be useful since its not on amazon sugar free does not carb free a 1 pound bag is 453g br br from the manufacturer website br ingredients hydrogenated starch hydrolysate , partially hydrogenated soybean and or coconut oil , acid combinations for flavor \( citric acid and or tartaric acid \) , egg albumin , salt , lecithin , sucralose , natural and artificial flavors , combinations of red 40 , blue 1 , blue 2 , yellow 5 , yellow6 br br nutrition facts br serving size \( 40g \) br br amount per serving br calories 110 cal from fat 20 br daily value br total fat 2 5g 4 br saturated fat 0g 0 br trans fat 0g br cholesterol 0mg 0 br sodium 25mg 1 br total carbohydrate 28g 9 br sugar 0g br protein 0g . 
this food variety is ground , thus my cat does n't care that much for this variety but , he liked the taste of it a lot so i have been buying it off and on throughout the years my previous cat really liked it so i 've purchased quite a few of these it 's got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares \? if your cat likes ground , give this one a try for sure . 
i absolutely loved newman 's own pretzels with the pepper baked right into the pretzel for just a little bite these are not as tasty and yes , they are messy and overly seasoned not really a fan of this line of flavored broken pretzel pieces , although this was a little better than some of their other flavors br br someone out there needs to try making the baked in black pepper version again , please not sure why newman 's own stopped . 
many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in new zealand it is now made in the us by performance pet products i have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and i was thrilled with it since ziwipeak has been switched to canning in the us it has been a nightmare several times in the last year i have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour i had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools also recently i have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue i 've contacted the us distributor twice but they have never replied a batch i got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy . 
my cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money it is just sitting in our cabinets i will donate it to a shelter . 
i 've eaten claxton farms fruit cakes for over 40 years and love them i thought i 'd be smart and order 5 one pound cakes at once as i know i 'd use them this time the quality control went out of town lousy absolutely disappointing of the 5 loaves , one was good , two were so dry they crumbled rather than be cut and i ended up adding them to cake batter in cupcakes or put on ice cream as topping , totally unable to slice br br the last two loaves just the opposite , they were runny when taken out of the wrapper they just flopped over , again , had to use as ice cream topping or put into cake batter for cupcakes br br claxton farm might have sold out or fired the quality controller awful quality after all these years do not order from claxton as you do n't know what you 'll get they lost a long time customer with me . 
in christmas , 2010 i first ordered clayton fruit cakes they where great ! nice big cherries and other fruits and nuts these were overloaded with the good stuff that makes a fruit cake really great so i re ordered in christmas of 2011 what a disappointment ! i ordered 5 one pound cakes when my order arrived , i was so excited yes i like fruit cake only too be very disappointed not only where the cakes void of very much fruit , unless you want too count the raisons as fruit i will not be ordering clayton fruit cakes next year i can get the same results from a hostess fruit cake , and only spend 3 50 , instead of close to 30 dollars for the clayton cakes . 
claxton dark fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950 's i ordered it directly from the company this year and when i served it at thanksgiving , my guests and i thought i must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell claxton fruitcakes it was at best 40 fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored cake i emailed the company and expressed my disappointment after several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners , they assured me that it was the original dark recipe br br in reading the ingredients , i noticed that corn syrup , sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient at the very end were listed molasses , spices and 3 artificial food dyes high fructose corn syrup was n't widely available until the mid 1970 's to mid 1980 's , so i'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients br br all of the people i talked to seemed to have the attitude that i was so stupid that i could n't possibly be observing what i had correctly although they offered to send replacements if i returned it at my own expense , they told me that what i would receive would be identical to what i have one of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year br br i am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition , but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash . 
the package arrived 3 days earlier then it said it would and they were very fresh they were also cheaper then the candy some of the candy had melted together but it was only maybe 3 pieces per bag overall really good . 
aweful ! they arrived immediately and still were as hard as cement ! the bags' supposed re sealable zipper , did n't re seal once and maybe the large amount had something to do with it but again , i cannot believe how stale and terrible the candy inside was ! . 
skittles are a great candy but for this product i would say do not buy it here , i have seen this same bag for 5 89 on sale and not on sale for 7 99 at some big chain stores the candies themselves are fine and if you are thinking of getting a big bag you know what they taste like just do n't overspend to get a big bag \( price wise might be cheaper to buy a bunch of little bags \) . 
get this type of sugar any other way than through ordering it because the shipping is insane ! the sugar is fine but for the price of the shipping , it was not worth it . 
i bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep my dog hardly touched the stuff , and then i looked at the ingredients one of the first things on it was corn a grain known to cause allergies in dogs as a matter of fact , corn might be the most allergy prone food amongst dogs not to mention , thanks to our friends at monsanto , it is almost always genetically modified \( gmo \) or a franken food , unless it 's organic real premium dog foods brag that they 've no corn br br right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken by products , another no no among real premium dog foods this means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it 's not real meat cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it 's cheap , but it 's not real meat a little further down you will notice bha , an artificial preservative , which again real premium dog foods do not have br br in short , biljac is a joke it is basically , insanely overpriced alpo , with no organic ingredients whatsoever , and uses all the shortcuts , filler , and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use do n't be fooled by the old fashioned appeal of the company 's 60 years in business there is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag , and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap , lousy ingredients calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a kia a mercedes for nearly the same price as this overpriced alpo , one could buy organic dog food , free of preservatives , corn , and cheap by products ! . 
i have to add that i 've not baked with this yet but when i received this i was aghast at the ingredients perhaps i did n't read it well because the ingredient list is right there i guess i simply expected alcohol vanilla beans , maybe sugar , in an ol' timey product br br i 'll update this once i use it . 
i am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten free diet for over six years , and was excited to learn about this product after eating it , the taste and texture was not bad i became sick in the way that i always do when ingesting gluten nana 's also makes non gluten products , and clearly are not careful about cross contamination if you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet , i strongly recommend you avoid this product i also think that the company should not deceive their customers , many who suffer from celiac disease , and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product . 
the flavor is decent \( berry vanilla \) , but i just ca n't handle the texture it 's like a mouthful of sawdust that just disintegrates when you bite into it i 've been gluten free for about 6 years , and there are much better products out there my kids wo n't even eat these ! . 
like other reviewers , i rarely eat cookies because i have an anaphylactic response to wheat gluten therefore i generally 'love' any cookies i'm not allergic to these are an exception the taste is mild and fleeting the texture is like sand and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth the only purpose these cookies are good for is dieting , because they are simply inedible blah . 
these are sort of like brownies a little soft , a little dry my 7 year old really likes them they 're good if you are on a restricted diet , but otherwise nothing too special . 
i love the other nana 's cookie bars and cookies , so i thought i 'd give these a try even though they are no gluten and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour they look nice , but the texture is a bit strange \( it 's kind of like eating really fine sand \) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch they do n't taste bad , which is a plus , but i wo n't be buying these again . 
i purchased these because they do not contain dairy , soy or corn well , in addition to being dairy free , soy free they are flavor free ! absolutely horrible dry tasting bars first words out of my mouth were tastes like dirt so that 's what i'm going with do not waste your money . 
these are so gross i ca n't believe i wasted my money on them they gave me an immediate migraine from the overwhelming artificial smelling fragrance i am not that picky an eater and i generally love any gf cookie just b c i am so grateful they exist but omg i immediately spit this out and rinsed out my mouth ! even my snack loving toddler did n't like these eating them , that is she did have a great time massaging it into a fine powder which takes almost no effort at all what a mess and what a waste of money . 
we have a gluten free household of 5 no one in our family likes these my children \( 9 , 7 , 5 \) are begging me to throw the box away i think they are afraid i 'll sneak one in their lunchbox the cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth have a glass of water nearby if you try these i hate to leave a bad review , but there are way better gluten free options out there br br \( i wo n't throw the box away i 'll pass it on to another gluten free family i know and let them form their own opinion \) . 
i was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of nana 's chocolate munch cookie bars to me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder ca n't even cover up i threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar . 
it is close to impossible to find a cookie that is both soy free , wheat free , and the only sugar that is used is from natural juices apple , etc that is the only reason i gave the cookie such a high ranking br as for taste , the chocolate flavor is pronounced , i enjoy the crunch , however , the texture of the cookie has a lot to be desired the cookie needs to either be crunchier or more moist as is it wants to stick to the roof of your mouth , and is just odd making it unappealing if i had tasted the item prior to ordering , i would n't have bought a whole box full . 
i have enjoyed this product for quite some time however , i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing ! at 35 per case , customers are paying more than 4 per box for 5 small cookie bars ridiculous ! i will find a healthier , more reasonably priced snack to munch on shame on nana and amazon . 
tastes like dry brownie w invisible pieces of puffed rice which get stuck in your teeth come on we can do better than this for cookie bars . 
it 's crunchy , i'm now love the smoother nana 's like a href http www amazon com gp product b000fnex8c nana 's no gluten lemon cookie , 3 5 ounce cookies \( pack of 12 \) a or a href http www amazon com gp product b000fnex8m nana 's no gluten chocolate cookie , 3 5 ounces \( pack of 12 \) a you get the idea i hope ! ! br i do n't have coffee or chocolate anymore ! br if you do n't have a problem great but i found out i do ! ! . 
our family has members who keep kosher , who are vegetarians , who are unable to eat gluten , etc this cookie covers all the bases , but tends to be soft and not entirely tasty however , they can be used to make a gluten free pie crust , which is a great feature i have the feeling that if they were baked a little longer they would be better br br really , though , how good can a gluten free cookie be \? . 
this product is definitely not as good as some other gluten free cookies ! try pamela 's ! . 
i love nana 's gf lemon cookies , so i figured i 'd try these berry vanilla bars too they 're a nice , soft texture but i am not crazy about the taste i feel strange about the berry flavoring in a cookie with no real berries , just little dried crunchies sporadically in the cookie i think i will try the chocolate bars next time around . 
i know what you 're probably thinking they 're vegan , they 're gluten free they 're a dream come true ! the taste of these bars is very banana y br but i doubt you 'll be able to ignor the texture long enough to enjoy that the texture is akin to eating a handful of dirt \( i'm no dirt eating pro but when i was trying to chew that 's all i kept thinking \) please if you 're thinking about trying these go down to your local natural foods market and pick up a box there first while you 're at it you may want to get some of your favorite soymilk and lots of it ! br br ps br if you 're in the market for a yummy vegan bar try the betty lous brand the strawberry is super good ! .

be careful even though this is listed under gluten free section it is not gluten free .

i was a bit disappointed in these they crumble very easily and have an unusual texture my son \( 6 \) does not like them . 
in the past i have purchased these cookie bars through amazon and have had good business however , amazon has not kept up with the ingredients changing in these cookie bars it is very important to me what ingredients are in the foods i purchase i am not happy with amazon 's business this time ingredients change often ! amazon needs to keep up to date with the ingredients if they are going to have them listed on their website . 
i do n't think i 've ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars , ever in my life they taste okay , but i just ca n't choke them down , even with coffee . 
this device 's lid does not seal i am not sure why it is being sold as anything other than a trashcan did work well for beer as long as it was transferred to a secondary right at the end of fermentation . 
i love community coffee but the batch i received of the special decaf was old the bags had lost their vacuum packed state .

my kids love these fruit roll ups and i remember having them as a child so i was delighted when i saw i could buy a large box however , when they came we were disappointed ! the were were very old and hard we only opened one and it broke into pieces because it 's a food item , you ca n't return which i think is ridiculous we could n't even eat them ! i order lots of stuff from amazon and have had a great experience except for these fruit roll ups do n't buy food from amazon ! \( the only reason i gave it 1 star is because i had to click on something and they did arrive on time \) . 
the item shipped in an unsealed plastic bag within a brown cardboard shipping sleeve arrived with product loose and falling out of the cardboard no effort had been made to seal the plastic bag or the shipping sleeve unbelievable br the product itself is very foul tasting with a horrible lingering aftertaste could be the coating \? br br i am very disappointed in the purchase and would never buy again especially from this vendor stay away from these ! . 
we have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the beneful healthy weight we 've noticed very unpleasant results they whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we do n't get them outside in time our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have my theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative i will most likely be going back to purina one . 
ive noticed that my dog has had more frequent bowel movement than usual he is on a strict schedule for potty break and has been very good on it for the past 4 years until i tried this food now he poops in my apt in front of us because he has to go so bad , like the poster above , its one hell of a laxative when my very well trained yorkie cant even hold it in . 
i bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat , and with a name like beneful i thought i was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food my dogs did eat this food , but after reading the ingredients i completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs the first three ingredients are ground yellow corn , chicken by product meal , and corn gluten meal how disgusting is that \? ! the main ingredient is a corn filler one thing my vet told me a while back that i never forgot when you eat corn , what comes out of the other end \? the same thing happens with dogs basically , dogs cannot digest corn , it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full , poop out more , and retain less nutrients the only meat in beneful at all is a by product , its not even a real meat ! by products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested we 're talking beaks , chicken feet , eyeballs , even chicken poop ! i would not recommend this product to anyone , for any reason , ever it is an absolutely awful dog food i ca n't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising br br i recommend to stay far away from beneful , and most purina products when purchasing a dog \( or cat \) food , the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself now that i know what to look for , i usually buy my pets all natural , organic foods such as blue buffalo , halo or wellness . 
i started giving my dog this a couple of weeks ago he really loved a different beneful and so i gave this one a try he loves it and is excited when its time to eat \( he would barely touch purina little bites \) i took him out of state to my mom 's place and he pooped in the house 3 times ! i took the blame for not paying enough attention to him however , since we 've come back home he 's pooped in my apt 3 times ! \( in 1 week \) he never does that i thought that maybe he was being spiteful , but i really think he just ca n't help it the food is one hell of a laxative if thats what you 're looking for i'm glad i only bought the small bag because i will not be giving this one another try it only gets 2 stars because he likes it and because i'm sure he would lose weight if he keeps pooping this much terrible . 
disappointed the big boxes had a very different flavor than the smaller boxes i am not sure why but not good . 
we recently purchased the k cup machine and i was quite excited as i drink iced tea rather than coffee this blend of black tea is quite bitter and not at all what i was looking for it works as advertised , just not the right tea for me . 
this is a really easy way to make terrible iced tea sometimes convenience outweighs taste , but not always what this product does n't tell you before you buy it is that the ingredients are black tea with tea extract , hibiscus and citric acid it 's not just tea and it does n't taste like just tea , either it tastes like powdered iced tea from a jar it has an overtaste of lemon that 's probably the citric acid and that fake tea flavor that comes from powdered iced tea mix i 'll probably drink it when it 's really convenient but i wo n't serve it to friends ! and i wo n't drink it if i have time to make a glass of real tea and pour it over ice . 
this tea is so strong you might as well not waste time brewing and just chew the leaves right out of the container it 's strong not in a normal strong tea way instead it 's bitter if you use a keurig model that has cup size settings a recommendation is to go with the largest setting for the largest cup you can fit under the keurig and work backward from there until you get to the taste you prefer also note that while it 's in smaller print , there is a warning not to use a glass to make the iced tea which is a warning worth paying attention to . 
although these are a quality dog treat please be aware that these do contain chicken i did not see this ingredient listed on the product page this is just to advise those pet parents if your kiddo has a poultry or chicken allergy like mine do that every variety to date contains both chicken and natural chicken flavor br the ingredients are as followed for the low calorie variety br br ingredients br organic brown rice powder , rice powder , vegetable glycerin , gelatin , water , tapioca starch , oat fiber , chicken , natural chicken flavor , dehydrated carrots , organic flaxseed , cranberries , apples , cinnamon , parsley , chia seed , carrageenan \( natural seaweed extract \) , l carnitine , peppermint , l ascrobyl 2 polyphosphate \( source of vitamin c \) , green tea extract \( decaf \) . 
not a big fan will not buy this again plus she eats it really quick too , other than the throw up part . 
the product was hard as a rock i could not even break it in half both dogs had hard time chewing them puppy could not either will not get product again unless the two packages i got were old and dried out . 
we have a year old pug who will eat just about anything but these ! unfortunately he just would not go near them no matter how hard we tried to peak his interest . 
i had high hopes for this product , because it is healthy and affordable but neither of my 2 chihuahuas liked it one just sniffed at it and walked away the other dog chewed on it for a short while and then walked away from it one dog likes a href http www amazon com gp product b003kuo2xs nylabone nutri dent original minichews for mini dogs , 72 count pouch a , and the other dog likes a href http www amazon com gp product b004b3w4n8 6 bully sticks free range standard regular thick select 6 inch \( 10 pack \) , by downtown pet supply a i was looking for some alternatives that were healthy and more affordable i guess i 'll be sticking with their current treats for now . 
these treats are more for a larger dog as they are very hard and thick the girls \( my maltese \) like them except way too big and hard to chew for them . 
these are a good alternative to candy , but still a lot of sugar in a better form br sharkies energy sports chews are not quite so sweet but are healthier becasue the man ingredient is brown rice syrup which is a complex carbohydrate with low glycemic index being very hypogylcemic brown rice syrup and agave nectar are the only two natural sweetners that do n't cause a sugar crash so for this reason the stingers only get 3 stars and sharkies get 5 ! if you want sweeter in sharkies get the kids version , but they are like stingers no brown rice syrup oh , the brown rice version fill me up faster because they are a complex carbohydrate and do n't cause blood sugar fluctuations . 
i am a huge fan of stinger products however , these little gummy gels do nothing as compared to the stinger honey packs if you are a road or mountain biker and need a good burst of quick energy to keep from bonking on that last hill , these will not help in fact , the only benefit that i \( or any of my riding buddies \) have found is that they make your mouth water conceivably , this could help with water consumption when riding through the desert \( moab , fruita \) it is my guess that these are not intended for exercising maybe , people just use them at work to keep from eating starburst or something less healthy \? ! . 
these taste great ! and it 's true what other reviewers have said about the consistency being good and them not sticking in your teeth however , as an energy boost for running , they do n't do a thing for me in fact , they actually cause a stitch so i just eat them whenever i feel i need a sugary 'fix' . 
this sparkling juice drink has a decent and refreshing flavor , though somewhat reminiscent of the canned orange juice \( ca n't remember the brand \) i had once in awhile as a kid br br it 's a nice idea to have a soda that has no added sugar , though the juice combination is n't as impressive as the name might sound this beverage contains a mix of the following juices \( reconstituted with sparkling water \) apple , grape , tangerine , orange and acerola the beverage also includes gum acacia and soy br br despite the fact that there are no added sugars , the calorie and carb counts are quite high in fact higher than an average soda an 8 3 ounce can contains 140 calories and 36g carbs . 
there are no surprises here the label promises a perfect blend between juice and carbonation , and that is exactly what switch delivers a drink that tastes like carbonated orange juice those looking for a healthier alternative to soda will like that switch contains 100 juice with no added sugar or corn syrup those looking for a tasty new carbonated beverage probably wo n't be impressed br br at the time of this writing , amazon is n't yet stocking switch so i ca n't offer an opinion on whether or not i think the price is fair i would n't expect to pay much more than orange juice for this drink , though , since there 's nothing really original going on inside the can . 
i thought this would have a similar taste to another brand of carbonated juice on the market , called izze , that has fewer calories , tastes better and costs less however , switch has a weird artificial aftertaste it tastes like a blend between orange juice and orange soda , but not in a good way also , with 140 calories per serving \( 8 3 ounces \) and 34 grams of sugar , you might as well drink soda because this beverage it not any healthier and certainly not cheaper . 
if you like the sort of carbonated fruit punch that you get at , e g , office holiday parties \( where alcohol is verboten \) , you 'll probably like the switch it does have a nice , fruity taste \( kind of a sharp orange perhaps the tangerine 's influence , although probably more the apple juice \) , with a bit of a bite due to the carbonation if this were one of my options at , e g , the medusa esque soda dispensers found at 7 11 , i would definitely indulge occasionally and buy some br br but an indulgence it is and that 's why i'm not planning on purchasing more from amazon in particular br br you 're paying nearly a buck a can for a little more than a cup of soda please i do n't mind paying more for higher quality goods , but at least make it a decent value for the money make it 12oz br calorically it 's not a great value , having around half again as many calories per once as coca cola does if you 're some teen who can eat whatever you want , this does n't matter but for those of us who are n't blessed with such metabolisms well the calories are better spent elsewhere the no sugar added ! bit is somewhere between annoying and downright misleading the all natural sugar that 's coming from the fruit juices is no better nor worse for you than , e g , regular old cane sugar like better traditional soft drinks have br br so , in brief , yes , it is quite tasty , but it 's really not a good deal for your pocketbook nor your health unless consumed only on special occasions br br p s my wife tried some as well , and did n't like it as much she tasted some of the unpleasant metallic tastes that others here have mentioned . 
i split this can with my spouse i would have given it 2 stars , he gave it 3 nice idea , 100 carbonated juice , but the taste is pretty mild not really what i would call refreshing good idea , though , i would try it in other flavors . 
although some may like this drink , it will not be a repeat buy for me 140 calories for an 8 oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115 actually this drink is n't 100 orange tangerine juice , but a mix of juices secondly , if this were unaltered juice , seems you would n't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100 of your daily vitamin c since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150 perhaps the processing requires it but , alas , the biggest issue for me was taste it tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells br br on the good side , the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that there is no sugar added and the non traditional taste is not overly sweet the taste may appeal to some , but i'm not a fan . 
no caffeine , no high fructose corn syrup , 100 juice , nothing artificial what 's not to like \? br br i hate to write anything negative because i do n't want to discourage development of any products that avoid hfcs but , to be honest , the switch orange tangerine does n't smell very good if you 're familiar with airborne cold remedy , well , it smells like that i think i was expecting a fragrance like tang instant beverage i certainly did n't expect it to smell like it does it 's not all that bad , it 's just not real good br br i also think this product would actually taste better if it were n't carbonated br br the calories are about the same as a typical soda but they 're fruit juice calories instead of hfcs , so that 's a big plus in my book . 
with all natural ingredients and mostly real fruit juice , i'm not expecting this drink to taste like soda , punch , or anything like that , but i when i tasted it , i felt myself wanting more i could really taste the orange flavor coming though , but they somehow missed me on the tangerine side tangerines are very sweet , so i was expecting that to be the predominant flavor , but instead what i tasted was mostly orange , which left a somewhat sour bitter aftertaste in my mouth this drink was n't bad , but given a choice , i 'd rather drink orange juice or tangerine juice with seltzer i do n't see how this drink improves beyond that switch 's other available flavors tasted much better , so in some ways this was a disappointment . 
i did n't like this carbonated juice although it appears to be all juice \( not artificial flavors \) it tastes somewhat artificial perhaps it tastes more like canned orange juice \( which tastes nothing like real orange juice \) ! i fully expected to like this as i do like fizzy fruit juice drinks this one did not do it for me . 
yeah it 's gluten free and whatever , but unless that 's a really big issue for you and you 're having trouble finding sugary drinks to enjoy on your gluten free diet , there 's no real draw to this drink over say , orange fanta or any number of other carbonated juice type drinks i thought it was massively overly sweet , and i have something of a sweet tooth the orange flavor was n't particularly authentic or delicious , and it left a sour aftertaste i got a free sample this time , and i cannot see actually paying money to buy this product again on an environmental note , packaging and shipping these things in tiny little cans makes for more waste , and i do n't appreciate that either not a fan . 
i was surprised at the ingredient list and 100 natural stamped on the side , because this drink tasted just like a compeletely artifical energy drink this is going to be a short review for me , because i do n't really have much else to say i could barely tell it was orange , because as with energy drinks it just tastes like an amalgamation of fruits my wife was especially confused she gets sick at the smell of drinks like monster , and she had the exact same reaction here br br i know this is n't an energy drink , but for the life of me , i just ca n't reconcile the taste with the ingredients if you 're the sort of person who drinks some fresh fruit juice and thinks i really wish this tasted more like a completely artifical enegry drink instead of natural fruit juice , then this is the product you 've been dreaming of . 
at 22 99 for a pack of 24 cans of switch orange tangerine , you 're paying about 96 cents per can is it worth it \? not really first of all , you drink juice for health reasons vitamins , frutose over corn syrup and the like carbonating beverages generally are n't considered good for you , so it 's odd that the two would be mixed br br besides the carbonation , and the aluminum can \( which has been proved can lead to alzheimer 's \) there 's a lot of deceptive marketing going on the can claims that switch is 100 juice , but it 's not actually 100 orange and tangerine juice in fact , the drink is mostly apple and grape juice you can taste this instantly , along with the metallic tang of being in a can this is done because both of those juices are quite cheap in comparison to orange and tangerine so really , you 're getting more a a carbonated fruit punch then an orange tangerine drink br br you 're also gettinbg natural flavours and colours which kind of kills the whole 100 juice claim br br with a taste that is both metallic and not really resembling the flavours it claims , i ca n't really recommend this product , you can generally buy boxed 100 juice for less , which contains more flavour , no aluminum and no carbonation . 
i did n't really like the taste of this product much it has an artificial taste to me , even though it is juice and water it is a carbonated drink and it somewhat reminded me of the taste of baby aspirin , although not quite that bad i did drink the whole can the 8 3 oz can is narrow , compared to the 12 oz soda can you are used to seeing br br the can says it is 100 juice , 100 rda vitamin c , all natural with no sugar added , no corn syrup , no preservatives , no artificial colors , and gluten free the nutrition box indicates \( for the entire 8 3 oz can \) 15mg sodium , 36g carbs , 34 g sugar , vitamin c 100 , vitamin a 20 br br the ingredients are as follows and are listed in the following order 100 juice \( filtering sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates , apple , grape , tangerine , orange and acerola juice concentrates \) , gum acacia , natural flavors and colors , ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) contains soy \( first ingredient listed is supposed to be the one there is the most of \) br br you may wonder why i spent so much time on the ingredients well , if you do n't read labels , you really should start some products may taste really good but may be full of nasty things you really do not want your children to eat \( or yourself \) the term , gluten free , for example is very important to those who have gluten intolerance br br kudos to the manufacturer for making a healthier product and i would have liked to have given this flavor a better review , but the taste was not there for me the black cherry flavor has a lot better taste br br still , if you are looking for a seemingly healthier beverage to pack in your child 's lunch , this could be worth a try think of it as a flavored carbonated water i gave it 3 stars because it is not unhealthy and it is not bad just not something i like the taste of br br i would sooner put this product in a child 's lunch than a soda my daddy used to put soda on the car 's battery terminals to dissolve the acid \( . 
switch orange tangerine is billed as the natural alternative to sodas and or artificially sweetened juice drinks however , i found it to be pretty ordinary br br first the good stuff it is 100 orange tangerine juice , has no sweetners , is 100 natural , has 100 of your daily allowance of vitamin c , and has a nice carbonation tang to it if you are health conscious and want to drink something like a soda w o actually drinking a soda , this would probably be right down your alley br br however , i found the taste to be somewhat odd i could definitely taste the tangerine in it mixed with the orange , but the combination of the two or the bottling or something gives this switch a taste akin to eating an orange that is almost too ripe you know that kind of fermented taste of an orange that you need to eat now because by tomorrow you 'll need to put out for the birds \? not exactly something that i 'd look forward to drinking br br so for me , although this was somewhat good , its not exactly something i would get again i'm not really a health nut so if i wanted an orange soda , i 'd just go out and get an orange crush . 
this drink contends to be a natural alternative to soda while it definitely is natural , i would not agree with the alternative to soda aspect specifically , the liquid is much closer in consistency to juice , and in fact , has more sugar than juice \( over 30 grams per 8 3 ounces \) sure , it 's lightly carbonated , but that alone does n't make this drink a soda also , if you wanted something natural , i 'd go with hansen 's sodas , or a number of natural sodas , which are definitely sodas this drink is basically juice with carbonation br br the other notable issue i had with this was its size 8 3 oounces does n't get you far \( 3 gulps , maybe \? \) , and coupled with the thickness of the drink \( since it is juice , with quite a bit of natural sugar \) , you do n't get very much thirst quenching effect from this the 100 juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste br br finally , natural sugar is still sugar , and has just as many calories this stuff would n't make the cut in most school vending policies , with its high sugar content and i would n't give this to my kids instead , a couple of caprisun roaring waters juice pouches \( which each have about 1 4 the amount of sugar \) would do the trick for them br br not recommended , sorry . 
this was a weird drink i had high expectations , but the flavor was just odd it really did taste like fizzy tang drink mix however , my kids really liked it , and i think it is a great alternative to junky soda , so i will most likely buy more but not for me to drink \) . 
it is a good thing the can is so small the product is several cuts below sunny delight terrible ! . 
it may be all natural but it did n't have a natural taste to me the can size is small and the calories were more than i thought there should be i like the mild carbonation ok but i would n't switch from orange juice . 
i had to try this orange tangerine flavor because i had tried the watermelon strawberry and did n't like it very much , but wanted to give this company another shot i do prefer this orange tangerine it has a nice citrus flavor with that carbonated fizzy on the tongue sensation i give it a 3 , better then the watermelon strawberry and on ice i drank the whole can . 
i did n't read the label before i tried the drink , so i was a little surprised by the carbonation it had a tangy flavor which was possibly enhanced somewhat by the carbonation however , i 've been a long time drinker of the tropicana orange tangerine juice and switch is simply not as good , imho if i was n't already a tropicana drinker , i might be interested in the switch version of orange tangerine , but i'm not going to switch sorry for the pun . 
on the plus side , they get the flavor and carbonation right here one fears a tang taste , but it 's more subtle than that and the bubbles are likewise discrete enough that it 's no fizzy lifting drink br br on the downside though , one would prefer a sharper after taste to the sort of syrupy way it stays on the tongue . 
it 's a refreshing drink when served cold a bit sweet when warm a little tart , but tolerably so br br the flavor is less orange than tangerine , yet i can distinguish several different layers of citrus in it , including the orange it 's an interesting sensation br br i am a little bugged by the fact that an 8 3oz can \( 2 3rd size \) manages to pack more junk calories in than a full sized can of cola it 's also supposed to be 100 juice , but reconstituted grape juice is practically pure sugar and there are natural flavors noted in the ingredients list as well as a soy warning which to me implies some sort of msg , probably added with the citric acid br br so , maybe it 's not an especially healthy beverage it 's still tasty and provides a diversion from more typical sodas . 
bottled like an energy drink , switch , does n't contain the things you 'd find in other carbonated beverages there 's no sugar , no caffeine , no corn syrup , no preservatives or artificial colors br br instead , what you get is a refreshing , all natural , lightly carbonated tangerine orange drink loaded with vitamin c think of it as orange soda without all the things you do n't want switch has just the right amount of carbonation to make the beverage refreshing without being filling br br it 's a zippy beverage made with real tangerine , apple , and grape juices , and would make a refreshing beverage , lunch , dinner , or snack time drink br br there was a slight aftertaste that i'm chalking up to either the can or the citrus , but it did n't get in the way of enjoying the drink br br make the switch to switch . 
the biggest argument i have with switch is that at a hair under 1 for each 8 3 oz can , it 's awfully expensive i probably could overlook that if switch was really , really delicious , but frankly it 's not the orange tangerine blend lacks the zip and character of those citrus fruits , particularly tangerine and its delicate sweetness br br instead , there 's a heavy taste of the apple grape combination of juices that forms the fruit base there 's no added sugar , no high fructose corn syrup or any other sweeteners save the apple and grape concentrates , and that 's fine , i 'd prefer my juice to not have added sweeteners in my opinion , juice does n't need to be sweetened i suspect that the fruit concentrate combo is cheaper than making the drink out of pure citrus juice , so i wonder why it 's as expensive as it is br br what makes me scratch my head is the notation contains soy what \? why \? why on earth put soy in a fruit juice cooler \? honestly , i 'd buy some seltzer or carbonated water of some sort and mix it with my own fruit juice before i 'd buy switch but if you 'd rather have it pre made , then by all means give it a try it 's decent enough , just not my glass of juice . 
switch does not taste like carbonated juice it tastes like overly sweet orange soda , which may or may not be a positive for you the 8 3 ounce can contains 34 grams of sugar i did not like the taste , my husband thought it was okay br br the reason i'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 is because it does not have any preservatives , added sugars , or high fructose corn syrup it does however contain soy , so if you are allergic or concerned about gmo soy , then you may want to avoid this drink br br if you are looking for a natural , sweet , carbonated beverage , i would recommend ooba hibiscus drink over this . 
if you 're looking for a healthy alternative to your favorite orange soda , this might be a good choice for you br br this is one of the better tasting switch flavors , although it still tastes a bit like a flat orange faygo or slice drink it 's good , but there 's a bit of an aftertaste to watch out for it does n't give you that weird filled up feeling that carbonated beverages seem to have , but if you 're looking for some refreshment on a hot summer day \( 90 degrees where i live as i write this \) , i 'd stick to tried and true kool aid instead br br decent , and a good orange soda alternative , but not life changing . 
switch is a tangy drink that 's more reminiscent of sprite than orange juice it 's carbonated all the way and you will even burp after it as you would 've after consuming any soft drink the drink does n't feel sugary , but a quick glance at the nutritional facts reveals that each can contains 34 grams of sugar the claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added , so i'm assuming that 's the sugar from the orange and tangerine the can . 
in proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content , but i would prefer a regular soda than this stuff there is a slight citrus taste , but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after wards br br soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing , pleasant , and nice refreshment , but none of these traits are in this drink br br i would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone i liked for any occasion , but would consider giving it to people i really did n't care for to see their reaction br br avoid this one orange crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame . 
this is a decent flavored carbonated juice it 's 100 juice which is good for the more health conscious people it tastes pretty good , sweet and a little tangy but the flavor does fall short like some reviewers have said , the drink tastes more like a punch than pure orange or tangerine juice do yourself a favor , if you want orange flavored soda , then go for an orange flavored soda if you want tangerine , then buy tangerine the infusion of both flavors really causes both flavors to fall short slightly short . 
like the switch beverage i previously reviewed , this is a moderately tasty drink the balance of the carbonation and the fruit juice is decent enough , giving more of a tickle to the tongue than the rush of bubbles that soda usually gives it 's definitely a lot more like juice than soda , which goes against its purpose of being a replacement for soda overall , it 's pretty drinkable , but i would never seek this beverage out there are better juices , and there are better sodas br br one major plus , though , was that it was n't as thick and syrupy as the watermelon strawberry switch br br 6 10 . 
if you like orange crush you may become a fan , but it 's too much of a hybrid for me the main two ingredients are reconstituted apple and grape juices it contains something called acerola juice , which is high in vitamin c \( and indeed the can contains 100 of your c and 20 of your a \) br br the sugar content is high 34 grams which brings the carb percentage up to 12 for the day and the calorie count to 140 i think it tastes too acidic for anyone who is watching carbs and calories to be willing to spend them on switch , which almost tastes like carbonated tang i 've tried the ooba drinks , and they are much lighter and more refreshing guess i'm just not ready to make the switch ! . 
i really did n't think there was anything special about this product it does n't have a bad taste , but it is different than a regular orange flavored soda it is definitely not as sweet \( which is n't a bad thing for me as i find the orange sodas way too sweet \) and left a tiny bit of an odd aftertaste it is a healthier alternative to regular sodas as there is no high fructose corn syrup , but it was still just as caloric it is juice rather than artificial syrups , but the first juices listed in the ingredients are the overly sweet apple and grape constitutes , not orange and tangerine , to make the drink taste sweeter i suppose honestly , considering the price of this product and the lukewarm impression it left on me , i would rather just pour my own juice blend and add soda water or sparkling water to it myself most juices seem to be vitamin c fortified themselves , so unless you are just looking to replace the artificial sodas with something less damaging , i ca n't see a big benefit to this product . 
this product taste like an orange juice , an artificial one but with less sugar and less flavor i did n't like it . 
i thought i would like this more than i do maybe it 's my palate , but my first taste impression was pineapple , not orange or tangerine the small portion size may be acceptable for an energy drink , but is not what i would call thirst quenching not a good choice for anyone trying to control calories or carbs on the plus side , it is sweet , but not too sweet and the level of carbonation is well balanced . 
i do n't like how so many bottled and canned drinks these days \( even the low calorie ones \) are so sweet this was nicely not too sweet , but had a canned , not fresh juice flavor it is personal taste , but i did n't care for the 'processed' flavor . 
the product may be every bit as healthy as they claim , but even if that 's true , i could barley get down one can of this stuff it tastes like sour orange juice with some carbonation in it it does n't taste anything like orange soda , and the taste it does have is n't very pleasant also leaves a very nasty aftertaste , and like many sodas , this will leave you more thirsty than when you started drinking all in all , i cannot recommend this stay away . 
i'm not a big fan of carbonated juices , but am a huge lover of orange tangerine in that respect , this was a disappointment for me , not being as tangeriny enough for me the first sip left me with an extremely unpleasant aftertaste , but had gotten easier to tolerate with additional sips but , after waiting a while for another sip , that initial unpleasantness returned if i'm going to drink juice , i 'll stick to what i prefer , uncarbonated . 
looks can be deceiving , especially with this product the cute , tiny can looks great , but do n't fall for it ! this little guy packs an amazing 140 calories per 8 3 oz can my favorite 24 oz arizona iced tea \( black white tea with sugar \) has almost just as many calories \( 150 \) and almost 3 times the size of switch also , do not be tempted with 100 vitamin c and 20 vitamin e pitch either most of us consume 100 of daily vitamin c without even trying through foods and anything extra get eliminated br br the taste however does feel a bit more natural than other artificial orange sodas though , so that 's the only plus also , if you do not worry about gaining weight , i guess this is a good way to get a sugar rush in a tiny can br br overall , a good tasting product , but there are many other low caloric alternatives out there a can of diet coke and a multivitamin anyone \? . 
when i tried a can of switch orange tangerine i was expecting to taste something similar to orange crush or sunkist soda switch is actually quite different br br switch claims that it does n't add any extra sugar or common additives found in most mainstream sodas and when you taste it , i believe them since it does n't have the added refined sugar of an orange crush type soda , switch comes across with a subtly harsher , more acidic taste this can of switch tastes like well carbonated orange juice to me , this is a good thing i enjoyed the flavor and found it tasty and pleasantly unique br br given all that , i would absolutely buy this product all of the time if it was n't for the unfortunate price these cans are only 8 3 ounces and cost close to 1 per can that 's a heck of a lot more than the 0 25 0 33 you pay for a 12 ounce can of mainstream soda \( when purchased as a typical 12 or 24 pack \) br br i love the taste of this stuff , i love that it does n't have all kinds of extra refined sugar , and i hate the price i want to buy it , but i just ca n't afford it and have to drop it to 3 stars on that merit alone too bad . 
the switch orange tangerine soda is an attempt to made a fruit soda with real fruit juice , real fruit flavor , and no added sugar they have mostly succeeded in the glass , the switch looks like juice it is lightly but distinctly carbonated and easy to drink the orange and tangerine flavors are true none of the burn of fake orange flavor the hit of tangerine is really nice and i greatly enjoyed the flavor my problem with the switch was that it was too sweet for my taste i was surprised at the how sweet it was given the advertised no added sugar the ingredient list mentions grape and apple juice concentrates that 's how they get the sugars in without adding sugar fruit juice concentrates are loaded with natural fruit sugars the nutritional label tells the story the 8 3 oz can has 34 grams of sugar ! that 's more than cocoa cola \( 27 grams per 8 oz \) bottom line this is just too sweet for me it 's too bad because the flavors are awesome if you have a sweet tooth , maybe this is for you . 
i was looking forward to tasting the switch orange tangerine drink since orange and tangerine flavors are two of my favorite but i was disappointed in the result br br it was tangy it tasted of ascorbic acid it smelled of orange candy it reminded me of breakfast it reminded me of , yes , powdered tang mixed with carbonated water followed by a strong unpleasant artificial aftertaste i found the the drink to be , simply , not very good br br i tried to like the beverage and i did appreciate the concept but considering the unusual flavors , high calorie count of 140 cals 8 5 oz , and cost of almost a dollar serving i cannot recommend switch . 
i 've become a fan of the switch sodas the black cherry flavor has a great balance of flavoring and carbonation that had me ready to give up traditional sodas the orange flavor however , leaves a lot to be desired it has a really strong after taste and despite being 100 juice it tastes like bad artificial orange flavoring br br i 'd opt for the grape or the black cherry for sure a href http www amazon com gp product b001lg940e the switch black cherry , 8 3 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a br br also , you 'll want to note that the switch sodas are n't exactly healthy , they are simply not overrun with artificial flavors they actually have a fairly high calorie count that being said they have some health benefits over pop like the vitamin count and no added sugars . 
i expected to like this drink because i like various fruit juices and i like carbonated beverages , as well unfortunately , i just did not like the consistency or the taste of this drink it was thick , had very little bubbly carbonation and , for me anyway , there was a very unpleasant aftertaste that lasted a loooong time i finally brushed my teeth really well and used some strong mouthwash to get rid of the taste in my mouth . 
this drink is ok a little pricier with several more calories and carbs than i would like , but it is a good alternative to soda i am glad there 's no artificial sweetener in it it 's sweet enough without it i like the crayons drinks better , but cannot find them anymore i also like the flavor of the r w knudsen spritzers a little more . 
i'm always looking for a carbonated alternative to sodas so i thought i 'd give this a try generally i enjoy drinking naturally flavored sparkling water like la croix or crystal geyser i also very much enjoy izzy 's sparkling water juice blends unlike izzy , which combines juice and water , this is a 100 juice beverage that is carbonated i have to say , it is definitely full of flavor , but it 's just too sweet tasting i like a bit of orange juice now and then , but for this type of carbonated drink , i'm just not into all that sweetness i tried diluting it with some sparkling water , but the flavor just was n't quite what i wanted i like that izzy is just a bit on the tart side with it 's flavors this is a nice idea and it 's pretty ok i just prefer other beverages over this one . 
i just tried the orange tangerine version of the switched carbonated drink and overall i like it it tastes very similar to mandarin orange slice but it uses natural juices and no hfcs if you are very concerned about artificial flavors and hcfs , but still want a carbonated drink , then switched may be a good alternative i read the ingrediants list and it mainly included reconstituted juces and then aboiut another line of preservatives and additives , i would assume similar to those in commercial fruit juices br br personally , i am more concerned about overall sugar and calories in my soft drinks so this little 8 oz can has 140 calories and 34 grams of sugar if memory serves me that is in line with the calories of most softdrinks and more sugar then most soft drinks br br ultimately , i think this is a good tasing product , but the touted benefits does n't outweigh the increased price and availability conpared to regualar soda i guess the key is still moderation . 
i was n't sure what to expect from a carbonated fruit drink , but decided to give it a try while it was drinkable , i actually prefer the natural taste of fruit juice this actually tasted like an artificial soda , much like a very well known orange soda the carbonation was excessively strong , with too much bite and burn for my liking br br as some other reviewers pointed out , the amount of sugar and calories in this drink was astounding it is almost too sweet , and combined with the carbonation was just too much for me to enjoy it very much . 
i could not finish this drink , it is like drinking orange syrup it may not have any added sugar in it but one can of 8 3 ounces has 34 sugar grams and 36 carbs i 'll stick to water when i want to quench my thirst ! . 
this is for sure not what i was expecting it to taste like it 's not bad but not for me i like the carbonation and juice idea with no added sugar when i first took a sip of it i noticed it has a bite to it the best way i can describe it is a non alcoholic champagne i however did like it better than the watermelon but still not for me . 
this one tasted pretty good very tangy , but in a 'real fruit' kind of way i think they got this one right i still ca n't ever see myself buying a bunch of this maybe if amazon sent me more than a single can to try , i would have build a habbit of drinking them \( cough hint cough \) br br i do n't really understand any drink this size if i were thirsty at all , i would want way more , at least 12 oz the only other drinks this size are those crazy energy drinks , and those are obviously more of a 'means to an end' kind of drink i guess it is supposed to be more of a gourmet soda juice i guess there is a market for that , i'm just not part of it br br nice little carbonated juice , but still not really worth the effort money for me . 
switch has 100 of what you want and 0 of what you do n't , according to the can also , according to the can it is 100 juice according to the amazon product page it contains soy quoting the printed page ingredients 100 juice \( filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates , apple , grape , tangerine , orange and acerola juice concentrates \) , gum acacia , natural flavors and colors , ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) contains soy br br there is an unusual taste it is difficult to decide whether it is the taste of the can or the taste of the soy br br the price is surprising the calories are shocking one can has 140 calories br br who knows \? we may develop a taste for switch . 
at first , i really wanted to like this drink the switch tasted like tangerines and had a good aroma the drink is carbonated , but not really strongly so it is pleasant however , after a few seconds , an after taste developed that was a little bitter my wife thought this after taste was even a little off , but she has a more sensitive palate than i do in any case , the net effect was that i would just as soon have orangina , and i wo n't be going out to buy more of the switch orange tangerine on the other hand , if this is what was being served at a party or gathering with few or no other choices , i would n't avoid it either . 
i love juice and i love carbonated beverages , but it is difficult to see this product having a long retail life br br essentially , this is a good drink that does n't really do anything well br br it does n't taste good enough to be a juice replacement and is there really a need for a juice replacement \? it might have limited value in camping situations or during other times where small cans make better travelers br br it 's not exactly a post workout recovery drink juice would be better minute maid juice , for instance , has less sugar and carbohydrates , even though switch does n't add any sugar and there are plenty of other juices that have more nutrients , including calcium and other vitamins and supplements , including potassium so , it 's less healthy than most juices br br switch is n't exactly a diet soda because of the natural sugar content comapared to zero sugar in diet drinks br br as a regular alternative to sugared soda , it tastes good , but there is nothing really to distinguish it from other fruit based sodas and , 22 a case , it 's more than twice as expensive of sodas that come in bigger cans br br so , in the end , switch is worth a try but likely not something you will habitually buy . 
this product advertises that it is a soda made from 100 fruit juices and is refreshing i was quite disapointed in the flavor if you have ever been unfortunate enough to drink canned \( not refrigerated or fresh squeezed \) oj you know there is a huge differance in flavor the bad , almost rotting component is carried over into this soda it even carries a rather odd aftertaste i was not able to finish the entire can br br this may be a feature of the orange flavor other fruit flavors of this product might indeed taste good but i recommend skilling the orange version . 
my daughter i were excited about trying this flavor as we both love orange juice this product did not impress us enough to order it as we liked other flavors more my son also tried it and did n't care for it the orange tangerine flavors are masked by the other fruit juices and makes it taste odd i like the fact that has added vitamin c and is a healthy alternative to sodas but the flavor on this one needs tweaking . 
ive tried the black cherry version of this drink , and i prefer that to this both are light and refreshing and way better than fruit flavored waters yuk ! you can tell by the taste these are definitely fruit juices but without the sticky , thick , sweetness of a non carbonated drink this orange tangerine flavor though there 's this weird taste to it one that hits you immediately not quite bitter , not quite metallic , but definitely not yummy unless you like bitter fruit not sour bitter maybe it 's too much carbonation for my taste if you 've tried the other flavors and are looking to try something new think twice about this one it is tingly and refreshing , but i wo n't order it again . 
i did n't mind the taste of this very much it tasted like minute maid oj mixed with soda my husband could n't stand it at all my only issue with this was that it was a heavy syrup sort of flavor that was a little overwhelming if there was a better balance of flavor to liquid to make it a little lighter tasting , i think this would be much more refreshing and enjoyable might be fine for kids though since they like that sugary orange stuff . 
i was n't sure what to expect with this citrusy , fizzy drink it was okay , though not something i 'd buy often , and certainly not worth the price in my opinion br br it was n't as orangey as i expected and it was n't until i had half of it gone that i read the ingredient list and saw why orange juice is actually the fourth juice listed on the ingredient list , with apple and grape juice first and second , and the tangerine that seems to tone down the sweetness slightly the third on the list br br when you look at the nutrition information , this product has about forty more calories than coke classic , and despite not having any added sugar , the grams of sugar in this product is more than an equivalent amount of coca cola ! ! the only bonus of this over real soda is the vitamin c and a there is n't much else nutritionally to speak of . 
span class tiny length 2 47 mins br br span short video review with first open , pour and taste of the switch orange tangerine . 
my first impression on this particular drink when i first tasted it was that it reminded me a bit of the soda orange crush , although nowhere near as carbonated unlike orange crush , this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have , and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that i did n't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it you know the kind i mean , when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first i also did n't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either br br now coming in at 8 3 ounces , the calories in this drink are reported at 140 calories per can by comparison , a 12 ounce can of pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can so , on the calorie front i would n't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and pepsi , although if you do the math , this drink would actually have more calories than pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts however , if you look at the list of ingredients in both , you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas , although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100 pure fruit or vegetable juice br br to put in plainly and succinctly , this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one i would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available however , the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price br br the one thing that i had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can , which as i stated earlier comes in at 8 3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces in addition to the size of the can , there is also the consideration of price , coming in at roughly 1 00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda therefore , when you take the size of the product combined with the price , i would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product br br if they created a 12 ounce can and lowered the price , then i would be more apt to purchase it br br shawn kovacich br author of the achieving kicking excellence series . 
i did not find this drink anything special in terms of taste it is orange juice infused with carbonation the juice is quite acidic and you do n't feel that there is 100 fruit juice the drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer it does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free , no sugar and no artificial flavors this drink does n't have any special features and it does n't stand out well in a market crowded with many drinks br br 1 a href http www amazon com gp product b0014wyxqk izze fortified sparkling juice , pomegranate , 8 4 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a br 2 a href http www amazon com gp product b000q3ecxm minute maid mixed berry juice , 24 10 fl oz bottles , 240 fl oz a br 3 cal valls certified organic juices clementine \( 24 fluid ounce \) by igourmet com . 
the product says a twist because of carbonation well after pouring the drink over 3 pieces of ice the carbonation was gone the carbonation is definitely light and does not last br br as far as the taste goes i did not care for the taste at all it left a bad after taste in my mouth i cannot recommend this product i will stick with regular juice at a much lower cost br br to be fair i gave it two stars because my wife thought it was ok . 
the switch bills itself as great tasting healthy alternative to soda so i decided to see for myself the first thing i wanted to do was compare it 's nutritional facts against my favorite orange soda and this is how they matched up br br the switch orange tangerine \( per serving \) br 16 97 calories br 1 8 mg sodium br 4 3 g carb br 4 1 g sugar br 20 rda vitamin a br 100 rda vitamin c br br national brand orange soda \( per serving \) br 15 8 calories br 3 7 mg sodium br 4 3 g carb br 4 3 g sugar br br besides slightly less sodium , the addition of vitamins and no added sugars a href http www amazon com gp product b001lg945o the switch orange tangerine , 8 3 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a did n't really stand out as a winner based on nutritional facts alone so when it came to drinking it , i had expected to prefer the more natural taste that the switch might offer unfortunately the main two juices used in this drink are apple and grape and that left me not tasting the orange tangerine as much as i had wanted br br overall when comparing the two beverages not only did it not impress me with taste or nutrition , but add on the obvious price difference \( 03 per ounce vs 11 per ounce \) and the switch wo n't be causing me to switch i'm happy to stick with my good old orange soda . 
i tried this product after switch 's watermelon strawberry drink , and while i thought that drink was decent , i was not a big fan of the orange tangerine flavor the taste was an obvious blend of a number of different flavors in addition to orange and tangerine , and for me that made it taste more orange ish than orange as others have noted , the amount of calories and sugar are not that different from a cola , so it 's not really clear that it 's that much healthier than other sodas br br personally though , i 'd rather just grab a glass of orange juice or eat an orange instead i guess it depends on what you are deciding to switch from for people looking for an alternative to cola , i guess this might be an attractive product but as someone who prefers water or tea and rarely drinks sodas , this product is n't close to making me want to switch . 
i was offered the opportunity to taste this product because of vine i would not normally purchase this type of product , so my review and opinion will be biased in that regard br br i'm not a big soda drinker , i 'd just rather drink water or coffee i will occasionally drink a diet soft drink , usually diet pepsi or diet coke br br did you know that a single 12oz can of coke classic has 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar \? this 8oz can of switch has 140 calories and 34grams of sugar and this is healthy \? 4 ounces less is size , same caloric content and more sugar per ounce that classic coke ok , so it 's not added sugar , but still , that 's a lot of sugar 100 orange juice , 8 oz , has 120 calories and 28 grams of sugar br br the can says it is orange tangerine but in fact the contents are 1 water 2 concentrates of apple , grape , tangerine , orange , and acerola juices then they throw in some gum acacia , natural flavors and colors and some ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) and as a little surprise bonus , they have added soy soy \? br br i asked my wife to taste this product with me i poured the drink into two glasses and we both took a sip her reaction was swift and strong she hated it i agreed with her it was for me , sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth not only that , but the taste was just nasty it did n't taste at all like orange or tangerine to me it just tasted terribly sweet with an undefined cirtus something taste the carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience neither of us finished drinking our 4oz portion it went down the sink br br i would not purchase this product in the future and if i could have given it 0 stars , i would have it 's that bad . 
if you like a little fizz with your juice this is a good product tasty and refreshing however , like all juice it is not low in calories , so do n't buy it expecting it to be more like a low cal fruit flavored sport drink . 
for a beverage that is basically 100 fruit juice that has been carbonated , with no sweetners or preservatives added , switch orange tangerine pretty much tasted to me like a can of orange crush or sunkist soda br br that is n't a bad thing , per se but it was not something i would pay a premium for if i were in the mood for orange soda presumably , it is a little bit healthier than a straight soda , but it is nothing special to taste , and thus i will not go through the effort to seek it out br br \( on the other hand , my 16 year old daughter claimed to like it more than orange soda , and in fact said that she felt she could taste the grape juice in it as with many juices , even though it is orange flavored grape juice is a major ingredient so she would give it four stars \) . 
this tastes like carbonated orange juice , very tart it is very expensive compared to easier to find similar beverages if one had allergies or health issues , it might be worth drinking . 
the switch orange tangerine gets kudos from me for not including added sugars and nasty ingredients found in some traditional sodas , but as for flavor , it leaves something to be desired the initial yummy tangerine flavor of the drink is great , but after a few swallows , a strange after taste invaded my mouth i found it difficult to drink the whole can . 
my 7 year old daughter thought it was good tasted like pop but only drank 1 2 of the can i thought it tasted like watered down orange soda with very little fizz with funny after taste it is suppose to be 100 juice with vitamin c that has been carbonated ok here is my thought either buy 100 orange juice that taste like it came right of the tree or buy a orange pop for me this product wo n't be flying off the shelves . 
i really liked the taste of both this and one other flavor that we were able to order so i went on line to see what kind of pricing there was on it at only 8 3 oz for about a dollar , that 's roughly the equivalent of 1 50 for a single can if it was a full 12 oz soft drink our budget is n't going to justify ongoing purchases of this product if we had more discretionary money , we might do it , but it 'd be more of a treat than a regularly used product \( partly because of the small size \) so the taste was at least 4 stars , but the price brought it down considerably even recognizing the fact that the ingredients are far better than what is in most other soft drinks . 
this orange soda is clearly more healthful , and it tastes tangier , although somewhat less sweet , than other orange sodas the one big drawback for me was that this drink lacks caffeine . 
i want to start this review by stating that this is not the perfect balance between juice and carbonated drink i 've ever had that said this is certainly a good alternative for those who love carbonated drinks but do n't like some of the ingredients switch has attempted to address this concern and i feel it 's a step in the right direct this is an orange tangerine flavored juice that is carbonated but without added sugar , preservatives , corn syrup , or caffeine in other words this is about as natural as you can get without , you know , drinking real orange juice br br the can is also thinner then a soda can so you 're not getting as much liquid as you would a pepsi or coke this means there is less fat in each can , and the makers claim the product is glutton free it does have a bit of a weird aftertaste , but after a few sips it stops bothering you while not a perfect drink it 's one i enjoyed and will likely pick up again in the future . 
i have a tendency to avoid products with artificial sweeteners , and this includes sodas with high fructose corn syrup the switch is a line of fruit juice sodas with no added sweeteners not even cane sugar it has carbonated water , fruit juice , some natural flavors and colors , and vitamin c if you 're going to drink soda , carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go br br the switch has several flavors , including orange tangerine however , it 's clear some flavors are better than others the orange tangerine has a harsh aftertaste that another flavor i tried does not i 've tried other citrus juice sodas and enjoyed them , but something went wrong in the flavoring of this particular soda if you 're looking for an orangey soda , try izze 's sparking clementine instead . 
described as an alternative to soda , switch is a carbonated fruit drink made from 100 natural juices \( although not necessarily the ones listed as the flavor \) made mostly out of apple and grape juice , the switch orange tangerine does in fact have an \( oversweet \) orange tangerine flavor followed by a strong vitamin aftertaste it tasted like drinking a soda made from crushed flintstone vitamins br br want a better carbonated fruit drink \? pour half a glass of orange juice and add club soda . 
i chuckled a little when i read that this soda had no added sugar when i checked the label in the can since it already has 34gms of sugar anything more added and you 'll have sugar junkies of whoever tries the drink the soda is tasty and quite fizzy , i think it has more carbonation than fanta which goes flat easier the can is the typical size of an energy drink , but this is not an energy drink merely another fruit flavored soda it is flavored naturally , but that is the only difference from regular soda type drinks . 
according to the side of the can , it 's 100 juice with a balance on the carbonation it tastes great if not for the chalky aftertaste the low carbonation made it feel less of a soda and more of a juice i probably would n't buy it in the store because of the weird taste . 
i like the idea of a healthy soda type drink , but this flavor just missed the mark the tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth carbonated juice is a great idea , they just need to tweak the flavors a bit br br ranking the switch drinks from best to worst br br 1 watermelon strawberry br 2 kiwi berry br 3 black cherry br 4 orange tangerine . 
the can says it 's 100 juice , but the taste is powdery if you 've ever had a glass of kool aid or crystal light , you 'll know what i mean br br so there 's that 'from powder' taste also there is an aftertaste and all comes in a can the size of a red bull for 160 calories br br i did not like it . 
this 100 juice , carbonated beverage is a good alternative to traditional soda as a somewhat health conscious consumer , i avoid high fructose corn syrup \( hfcs \) as much as possible this beverage contains no hfcs , no added sugar , no preservatives , and no added color i'm sampling the orange flavor it contains 100 of your daily recommended dose of vitamin c , and 20 of your vitamin a for the day the downside is a single 8 3 fl oz can contains almost as many calories as a 12 oz a can of soda br br the orange tangerine flavor reminds me a bit of orangina perhaps you 've tried crystal geyser 's fruit squeeze beverages which are also similar it 's definitely not comparable to artificially flavored orange beverages \( sunkist , crush \) it has a hint of grapefruit like taste to it , but without the bitterness , which may be due to the added apple , grape , and acerola concentrates the aftertaste is a bit metallic to me the beverage itself is clear without pulp of any kind and is light orange yellow in color br br this is a good alternative to those looking for something soda like , but healthier than all the hfcs loaded options maybe it 's a good option for parents to give to their kids if their kids drink a lot of soda anyway personally , i do n't enjoy it enough to buy it instead of other available , similar products if i want orange juice or crave soda , i 'll rather drink the real thing . 
this carbonated product has a nice natural juice taste to it that makes you feel like you 're drinking something that might be a little healthier than all the other carbonated stuff out there on the shelves but i could n't help but notice the amount of sugar this thing has listed on the nutrition facts br br 34g per 8 3 oz can of the stuff 36g total carbs br br like i said , it 's good but do n't get fooled into thinking its any healthier for you there 's no artificial stuff in here according to the can at least . 
this product claims to be a healthy carbonated product this particular flavor is very heavy on the orange taste \( which is to be expected \) as a matter of fact , i found it very close to normal orange soda br br here are the claims of the product from the label br br 100 juice , 100 rda vitamin c , all natural , carbonated , great taste and refreshment br br no sugar added , no corn syrup , no preservatives , no artificial colors , gluten free br br nutritional information br br serving size 8 3 fl oz \( 245 ml \) br servings 1 br br calories 140 br fat 0g br sodium 15 mg br total carb 36g \( sugar 34g \) br protein 0g br br vitamin c 100 rda br vitamin a 20 br br ingredients 100 juice \( filtered spring water sufficient to reconstitute concentrates , apple grape , tangerine , orange and acerola juice concentrates \) , gum acacia , natural flavors and colors , ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) contains soy br br compared to soda , it is healthier in that it does n't contain added sugars or corn syrup but it still has a bunch of calories eating fruits whole is better than juice , but if you want a quick soda like pick me up \( and you love orange soda \) , i would recommend this product over regular soda br br i gave this product 3 stars because i do n't think it really is that healthy , but is a decent alternative to regular soda also , the taste was ok , nothing remarkable . 
i drank a single can of the switch orange tangerine flavor today upon first impression , the physical size of the can is a tiny 8oz or 250ml this in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml therefore , only about 2 3 the content of a normal can of soda to say the least , this is n't enough liquid for me in one sitting i need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so i was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up br br the taste of the drink itself was satisfying since there is no added sugar \( which is usually corn syrup in the us \) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland however , it was n't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100 natural juice more on the side of mixed syrup with water br br what kills this product is the high price product right now comes out to about a buck a can i would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk , it is an insult to say the least not worth the money . 
the switch orange tangerine soda does n't taste too bad and it is carbonated , but the taste reminded me of orange juice that went sour you know , when the o j has gone way past the expiration date and you gulp some and it has that bitter acidic taste br br anyway , the soda is made from a combination of apple , grape , tangerine , orange and acerola juice , and does n't add sugar , corn syrup , preservatives or artificial colors it 's also gluten free so that 's good news for those who are trying to watch what they eat and drink br br the 8 3 ounce can is smaller than the standard 12 ounce can of soda and maybe it just takes a couple of tries to get used to the flavor br br like i said , not bad but i 'll stick with regular diet soda but for a healthier alternative for soda lovers , i suggest trying one of the switch sodas or any naturally flavored sparkling water . 
i'm a fan of all natural anything , especially when it 's a tasty and healthy alternative to something i 've enjoyed my whole life , but i know is 'bad' for me br br regular soda is one of those 'bad' things loaded with artificial colors , sweeteners , corn syrup yuck hardly seems worth the risk when i'm also getting 150 empty calories on average br br and now switch has come along true to its claim , there 's nothing artificial in it just juice , sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients br br that 's great br br so i chose this particular flavor \( orange tangerine \) because i wanted the strong citrus taste i love this drink , however , failed to meet their promise yes , i can 'taste' the orangy citrus , but as much i can taste the apple and grape juices used as well br br moreover , this does n't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have i 've had mineral water with more bite br br but the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories \( the same as a regular can of coke \) and 36gcarb 34g sugar \( compared with coke at 39 39 \) br br on the up side , it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100 vit c and 20 vit a but if i wanted those kind of health benefits , i 'd rather take them directly from the source an orange br br overall , the all natural health pros of switch orange tangerine , simply do n't justify the high calorie and carb count the switch beverage co may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas . 
sometimes if too many flavors are mixed together , the result tastes like none of them this does n't taste like orange or tangerine it tastes , to me at least , very sweet and sort of orangy but not tart at all , and i like my citrus type sodas to be tart and sort of sour br br still , great for those who are trying to get away from the high fructose corn syrup diet . 
i was really looking forward to sampling this product it 's not bad , but a little too sweet tasting for me also , at 140 calories for an 8 3 oz can , i thought that was on the high end but it does contain 34 grams of sugar , and one must remember that fruit juice is not low in calories i would have preferred more sparkling water and less juice on the plus side , it has no artificial ingredients or colors and no corn syrup ! i am sure many will like this product more than i , especially those who prefer more sweetness in their beverages . 
this 8 3 ounce can of carbonated beverage is tangy and tasty and the slimmer size can means that you are drinking a smaller serving than an ordinary can of soda but although it 's 100 juice , it still packs quite the calorie punch one can is 140 calories , which is almost exactly the same as in a 12 oz can of regular coca cola ! so it may be slightly healthier than drinking coke since it has no caffeine or high fructose corn syrup and it has 100 of your requirement of vitamin c but it 's not going to make you as slim and attractive as the packaging ! . 
this product is not a soda but a carbonated juice this soda has a nice taste its not as sweet and as pure orange tasting as typical orange soda like drinks it 's not pure orange juice but made up of a mixture of several different juices including apple , orange , grape and tangerine that juice blend gives it a slightly tangy taste that is actually at first slightly surprising and mostly refreshing the carbonation also seems lighter to me than soda but it is definitely there br br the things i like about this product are the smaller can size \( 8 3oz \) which makes it a more appropriate serving that a regular soda i also like the bright packaging and the pleasant taste after reading the ingredients of switch carefully i see that it is all juice just as it claims so its probably a better choice than a regular soda br br this product has no added sugars just as advertised on the can but buyer beware its still kind of high in sugar because fruit juices are naturally high in sugar as always be sure to read the label if you are concerned about sugar levels br br overall i think this product is a good size and has a pleasant taste especially if you are looking for something that tastes like an orange juice blend traditional orange soda fans might be slightly disappointed in the taste . 
i have a big sweet tooth and thought i would really like this , but it was too sweet even for me i even tried adding water , but that did n't help i have n't tried any of the other flavors , so i ca n't comment on the brand in general , but i 'll never try this flavor again . 
if you think this is going to be a healthy product , you are sadly mistaken it still contains 36g of sugar per can ! if you want to end up a fat diabetic , by all means , try it otherwise , try the zero calorie , zero sugar , zero chemical naturally fruit flavored seltzers like those by la croix . 
these are definitely not worth close to a dollar a piece if they were at my local grocery , i might give twenty to thirty cents per can for them i did n't really like the flavor that well , but if you did , they might even worth up to fifty cents per can otherwise , pass these up . 
this had a nice citrus flavor , but it was too sweet and actually flat i did not get any kind of fizz or sparkle for the amount of sugar and calories , i rather would have eaten a piece of fruit and drank a glass of seltzer water less calories and more satisfying in my mouth i got this on gb special for about 13 52 for the case i do n't think i will purchase again . 
i liked the level of carbonation it was actually more highly carbonated than i was expecting , but did n't taste dry the way i would expect an artificial sugar free drink to taste with carbonation added i was hoping it would taste more orangey , but the tangerine is the more dominant flavor \( along with apple , a common juice filler \) despite having no added sugar , however , there is still 34 grams worth of it in the small 8 3oz can basically , other than having 100 of the daily value of vitamin c , this drink could easily be replaced with a better tasting orange soda that is in a 12oz can and costs far less unless you really like the taste , or you want to ensure your vitamin c beverage stays fresh longer , i 'd give this one a pass . 
the logo on the can states 0 of what you do n't want but that 's not quite true it 's quite tasty , but loaded with calories br br next time , they need to leave out the sugar as well br br also , this drink is n't readily available . 
i 've tried other flavors of switch carbonated juice drinks and have enjoyed them however , this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet i felt like i was drinking some sort of carbonated orange ade drink and could barely get it down while i would probably purchase the other flavors of switch , i definitely would not purchase this one . 
i was anxious to try this , but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me it has a very sharp harsh citrus y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness , the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance after awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage br br the can is small at 8 3 oz \( a regular sized pop can is 12 oz \) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical br br i also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop it still has loads of sugar in it so when they claim no additional sugar this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar but it does in fact have 34 grams . 
this drink tastes just like soda to me very strong and sweetened soda it reminds me a lot of fanta back in the day \( 1970s \) i know it says it has all these vitamins and that it 's healthy , but the flavor and amount of calories would keep me from buying this drink as a health drink there are plenty of vitamin and flavored waters and sports drinks that would serve the same purpose without all those calories if i want a soda , i certainly would n't pay a lot of money for something that tastes just like it but costs 4 times as much \( at a guess \) i do love the taste of fanta , though . 
this is my second can of the switch that i'm reviewing under the amazon vine program and while this one is perhaps a bit better it still has the same basic issues it 's over priced at almost 1 for a mere 8 3oz can in a 24 pack , but more importantly it really just does n't taste like orange or tangerine at all the ingredients actually list apple juice as the first type now why would you put apple juice in an orange drink \? now do n't get me wrong , it tastes exactly like one would expect carbonated juice to taste but the flavor is n't all that appealing br br i love orange juice , drink it every day i 'd love to try carbonated orange juice but this is far from that it might be a good substitute for normal soda for kids , but i ca n't imagine any other real reason to get this . 
note this is my first review of a product that is not a book , so please forgive me if i miss something br br i'm not a huge fan of fruit drinks like the switch , but i decided to go ahead and give it a shot after having my first drink , i can honestly say i wanted to hate it i mean , seriously , i'm drinking this can of 100 fruit juice with carbonation and reading all these really stupid quotes all over the can \( i e 100 of what i want in a soda , 0 of what i do n't \) , wondering how much a 8 3 ounce can of this junk costs \( thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 50 or 3 00 and thinking , if i wanted to drink some juice and would drink some juice ! i could n't stop thinking about what is so special about carbonation that i would want to drink this over a glass of oj i wanted to scream ! br br however , i kept my cool , and finished the drink there was something about this particular flavor that was enjoyable , but not engrossing there was something in the aftertaste that i did not like , and i think it had to do with the tangerine juice tangerine 's are n't my bag , either but it was tolerable br br after discussing this product with my wife \( i know , this drink apparently also contains the conversation starter attributes , bonus points for that i suppose \) she was like , this sounds great is it like those a href http www amazon com gp product b001iw25rk izze pomegranate sparkling 100 juice drink a \? \? i responded um i guess so br br i then also looked up the price and learned that i had grossly overestimated the price of a single can \( being just over a single dollar \) despite my wanting to hate this product , i 've decided to step out of my anti contemporary culture box , view this product for what it is , and give it a middle rating of 3 stars br br i can see the attraction i can see the appeal i just wo n't ever buy it i 'll stick to my glass of orange juice and tang any day br br good drinking , br br j stoner . 
i suspect this drink is an acquired taste after the first sip , i was reluctant to take another the second sip was an improvement and the third even more so by the end of the can , i was finding it fairly enjoyable br br it was only after i had finished that i noted the alka seltzer like aftermath yuck br br still , i am sure i could get used to it after a few more tries this is , i think , the problem with the drink i would drink it because it presents itself as being good for me , not because i was blown away with taste or a feeling of refreshment br br i would not buy it again . 
you know what one of my favorite sounds is \? the sound of a can opening i think it 's weird , consider i'm not a huge soda drinker since i find most sodas too be way too sweet or sugary br br this is a review for an orange tangerine drink from switch i 've never heard of them , but i was feeling kind of thirsty so i ordered a can from the vine program it 's an 8 3 ounce can of 100 carbonated juice \( plus gum acacia , natural flavors and colors , ascborbic acid and soy \) i do n't know what to think about some of the ingredients , but i certainly do know that i like that it 's only 8 ounces and that it has no corn syrup ! br br it tastes very similar to canned minute maid drinks , especially the vallencia orange offering but does have a slightly sickly sweet aftertaste i do n't know if i 'd run out and buy a 24 pack , but if i saw this in a restaurant i 'd definitely consider it as a tasty complement to a sandwich and potato chip lunch br br the last thing i like is about the company it seems to be an independently owned shop , and i like that . 
100 of what you want , 0 of what you do n't is proudly emblazoned upon the can that contains switch 's orange tangerine carbonated juice it certainly tasted all natural , as there was n't too much taste really br br do n't get me wrong , it was all right , but i would say it tasted kind of like sprite with a couple of orange flavored alka seltzers tossed in another note is that it is rather small at only just over 8 ounces however , it still had enough orange taste i suppose , so if you want an all natural mild orange flavored carbonated juice drink , then you 've just hit the jack pot ! br br if not , you may want to pass this up , mildly recommended . 
one of my favorite but rare indulgences is a can of orange soda so i was looking forward to the combination of bubbles and orange flavor when i popped open my can of switch orange tangerine to my disappointment , it tasted more like fruit punch , perhaps because of the apple and grape juices in it to sweeten it i would say the makers of this drink went overboard on the apple grape combo , not just in the flavor department , but in the sweetness it 's sticky icky sweet , more than any of the cheaper brands \( sunkist , crush and others \) of orange soda , or the higher priced goodies like orangina and the delectable izze br br it is fairly healthy however , with no bad stuff and quite a lot of vitamin c \( 100 based on 2 , 000 calorie intake \) , all natural , etc my recommendation is for more orange , less apple grape , or change the label flavor to mixed fruit it 's 140 calories per cute little 8 3 oz can , and if you 're not expecting orange you may like it so far , the taste winner for cute little cans for me is izze 's grapefruit , which has the perfect balance of flavor and carbonation , with the right amount of sweetness . 
to me , fruit juice in small cans are simply a staple first example that comes to mind is good ol' dole pineapple juice the trend towards trendy little health beverages in overpriced little cans is nearly tragic br br there is nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it if i want a soda , i 'll just grab one i do n't drink enough of them to have much dietary impact and despite the claim of 100 what you want , there is nothing in here for me if i want 100 of what i want , i will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water if i want 0 of what you do n't want , well , why buy it \? br br this is a time when we had better look pretty closely at what is an indulgent convenience and what is a necessity , and how to find a happy medium i consider the likes of pellegrino aranciata , orangina and izze a luxury , and when i indulge it is a true delight br br switch is a product that is not better tasting , proven healthier , or even less expensive than any of many other alternatives once again marketing is driving product creation and design , and that is a hateful concept br br if you want a similar taste experience for about the same price , pick up some alka seltzer cold plus nighttime you 'll stop sneezing and sniffling and get a great night 's sleep . 
the drink is 100 juice concentrate reconstituted with carbonated water it tastes like a cross between a href http www amazon com gp product b001gn4ohk orangina sparkling citrus beverage with natural pulp 24 cans a and the orange drink from mcdonalds br br it was refreshing at first , but the aftertaste is abrupt and almost chemically it 's odd , because the drink does n't have any unnatural flavors , according to the ingredients list if the end flavor was more natural , i would definitely buy it again . 
the switch orange tangerine presents an alternative to ordinary soft drinks , offering one hundred percent of what you want in a drink and zero percent of what you do n't want or so the manufacturer claims this is a newer brand of beverage and it follows a trend toward healthier alternatives for every day foods and drinks a trend that has been gaining steam as more and more individuals look for ways to improve their health br br this beverage offers a taste that is refreshing , but slightly different than what i expected yes , you get to experience the taste of juicy oranges and tangerines , but there are other flavors present as well and i could n't quite put my finger on these other flavors until i read the ingredients and discovered that the switch orange tangerine is also made with apple and grape juices the grape is barely noticeable , but the apple can be detected and it , along with added soy , is responsible for the interesting taste sensation that you experience in the aftertaste br br the switch orange tangerine is billed as a health drink and it does , indeed , have many positive selling points in terms of composition and nutrition there is no added sugar , no artificial colors , no corn syrup , and no preservatives the beverage is also gluten free and provides one hundred percent of the usrda for vitamin c and twenty percent of the usrda for vitamin a there is no fat and no protein , either but there are thirty four grams of sugars and a fairly high level of calories granted , these are natural sugars but thirty four grams is still a large amount and it wo n't be acceptable to those on low carb diets and with almost seventeen calories per ounce , the caloric content is higher than that of most soft drinks br br so , are there enough reasons to make the switch to the switch orange tangerine \? my answer is yes , due to both its good , refreshing taste and its better than average nutritional content it is n't the greatest tasting orange beverage i have ever tried and it is more expensive than most other drinks , including regular orange juice but it does have enough positive points to earn it a recommendation . 
sorry , but i just do n't get it you pay almost a buck for 8 3oz \( just over a cup \) of carbonated water and fruit juice concentrate fyi , the first one listed on the can is apple then grape then tangerine then orange the taste is fine , but personally , i would much rather have a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice for a lot less the can is small and cylindrical , like an energy drink , but there 's nothing in this to give you a boost fyi , there are 140 calories in one can if you have the to spend , then yes , it 's a tasty beverage but it 's simply not a good value in my book . 
pros not overly sweet like some juice drinks br no caffeine br no corn sweeteners \( if that matters to you \) br cons expensive for the size \( 8 3 ounces \) br ca n't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it br lots of calories br br i grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees i was surprised that i could n't taste those flavors in this drink , but then i looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts probably to keep the cost down br br i 'll stick to the sobe low cal drinks and the 10 calorie vitamin water because 1 they are cheaper and 2 i 'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor . 
this is not orange and tangerine juice it 's mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine and i really do n't care about the vitamin c content vitamin c is easy to get br br what i do care about is that this is definitely the worst tasting soda of any type that i have ever tried i could n't pour it down the drain fast enough . 
the switch orange tangerine drink is one of the many beverages out there that are trying to offer soda drinkers a slightly healthier alternative without sacrificing the flavor no mistake should be made to think that switch is primarily a fruit drink although it contains 100 juice , switch is a soda first and a fruit beverage second the carbonation , combined with the various citrus flavors , make switch taste a bit like mountain dew with an extra orange kick br br soda fans who like mountain dew but want something made of juice should love switch , as it does offer a slightly healthier alternative to the standard carbonated drink since there are so many fruit juices present each can has 100 of the daily recommended vitamin c and 20 of the daily recommended vitamin a the lack of artificial preservatives does also give it a slightly more crisp taste br br it 's important to note that switch is n't sugar free , but rather has no sugar added the distinction is missed by many , and could be very important for diabetics or anyone watching their sugar intake the drink actually has 34 grams of sugar in each can , but since it 's coming from the fruit juice and not from high fructose corn syrup it 's less of a problem for anyone looking for a more healthy drink br br the biggest factor in deciding if switch will be worthy anyone 's time depends entirely on how much they enjoy carbonated citrus drinks soda fans who want a fruitier and less artificial drink will probably love switch people who just want fruit juice and do n't enjoy the carbonated flavor should probably avoid , however . 
in fact , i did not like the artificial taste in this orange drink the degree of carbonation is alright and it does have an orangey taste to it but i cannot ignore the artificial taste that accompanies this beverage for now , i would stick with plain orange juice or other orange sodas like crush . 
i grew up on orange sodas and thought this might be like a 'healthy' crush that would be a no of course , tangerine has a bit of a different taste than orange as it 's that much sweeter adding the carbonation to it just made it an unappealing fizzy , ultra sweet drink , not unlike cough syrup proceed with caution perhaps kids would find it super tasty . 
as the title of my review indicates this product is nothing special in terms of taste granted it is missing some of the soda pop bad guys \( high fructose syrup and coloring \) but the taste is mediocre this is not something you are going to rave about because of the taste if you are a health food junkie you might overlook the bland middle of the road taste contrary to some reviews i did not find the drink exceptionally sweet but than again everyone has different taste buds i am not a soda pop drinker so that might have some influence on my less than enthusiastic endorsement i was switched off will this make you give up your favorite soda pop \? probably not i like the idea of homemade soda water infused juice for that perky fizzing drink better than switch not such a great product in my opinion . 
the switch orange tangerine looked very promising 100 juice , with some zippy carbonation i placed it in the fridge , and let it get a nice chill hours later , i popped the top , and my wife and i sampled br br and it tasted like drinking furniture polish it 's not like we we 're searching for derogatory statements about switch here is how the conversation went br br wife takes a swig , looks at me with eyes all googled yuck it tastes like furniture polish br br i take the can from her , thinking she must be insane i chug some down ah , yeah it does taste like furniture polish br br we poured the remainder down the drain if you enjoy drinking cold tangerine flavored furniture polish , by all means br br btw , this drink left a nasty aftertaste still belching it up . 
i did n't like this drink at all ! it had a very strange , almost chemically taste to it i also did n't appreciate switch marketing itself as all natural but had ingredients like natural flavors and colors what are they \? \? are they even natural \? \? i even let my three year old try it but she could n't even swallow it and spit it out in the sink too bad it would have been a good alternative to sodas but not with this horrible taste my daughter and i much prefer the ooba hibiscus drink . 
switch tastes more like chemicals than juice i was expecting something along the lines of orangina , instead it 's closer to orange soda but without the carbonation level that makes orange soda enjoyable for a small drink \( 8 3 oz \) , it 's pretty high in calories \( 140 \) frankly , i do n't think the flavor is good enough to justify the caloric level br br bottom line if you 're die hard soda drinker , this might be a better option for you if you 're a die hard juice drinker , stick to juice if you want fizzy juice , add a little seltzer to your fruit juice . 
there are things that i recall from my childhood that i would rather not being stung by a bee , chicken pox , all the attempts to learn to ride a bike before i actually learned to ride it , and tang tang was that chalky , never quite dissolved in the water , powdered drink that schools and company picnics would try to pawn off on kids as kool aid it was n't kool aid by any stretch of the imagination it was tang i 've never heard anyone ask for tang it was just what was there br br so i get my can of switch in the mail , eyeball the can it 's the same size and shape as an energy drink can one of those single shot type cans fearing that it was an energy drink i checked the label says it 's pretty much all juice , carbonation , and some natural flavors \( including soy \? ! \? \) so i pop it open and take a swig br br now it may be 100 natural juices with some natural flavoring but i know tang when i taste it this is carbonated tang i know it is somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with cannisters of powdered tang and someone thought to themselves what do we do with all of this stuff \? i know , mix it with carbonated water and voila ! now it 's not tang , it 's switch ! br br in all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can i would suggest whipping up your own tang with fizzy water br br pros pretty much all natural juices , natural flavors and no unnatural dyes \( good for the adhd kids \) br br cons i personally did n't care at all for the taste , a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting , can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink . 
overall the drink was decent it 's tart and sweet at the same time switch is alright but might not be worth the money depending on how much you like it i myself would prefer a spicy v8 over this it might be a good substitute for some who do n't want to drink as much soda , but for me i 'll just stick with the v8 and the occasional soda . 
this product has a nice smooth taste with the additional tanginess of tangerine br it also has a little bit of a sweetness to it but syrupy sweet br not lingering or noticeable aftertaste . 
when i first glanced at this item , my first thought was a nehi orange type soft drink however , it is made of 100 fruit juice with carbonation added it tastes way too sweet for my taste buds , much more than regular oj in fact , it left an aftertaste in my mouth and i had to brush my teeth right after taste testing it br br i ended up mixing the rest with a shot of vodka and it made a great screwdriver with a kick of carbonation . 
i enjoyed the product very much i like that it is not overly sweet or heavy there is no aftertaste and it goes down smoothly with just enough carbonation to give it body br br the tangerine orange taste i found to be clean if you like something that is sweeter , this might not be for you but if you enjoy the fruity taste with some carbonation it is quite nice i drank it chilled i do n't think i would have enjoyed it at room temperature br br the price might keep me away almost a dollar per 8oz can is kind of tough br br four stars for taste and two stars for price three stars . 
switch markets itself as an alternative to soda it is essentially carbonated fruit juice with no added sweeteners i do agree that if you are a person who drinks a lot of soda or have child who does , switching to his would be the better alternative br but this drink is not healthy by any means , the amount of fruit juice required for it 's tastiness results in a high sugar and calorie content for a fruit juice you would not want to drink 5 of these in a day and the better option would be a piece of fruit with less calories and sugar . 
this soda sounded like a good idea , but it is just too sweet the orange and tangerine juice is clear and bitter tangy but the sugar in this particular flavor is overwhelming to me \( on the other hand i liked the cherry very much \) i would drink it anyway , if it were offered , it certainly is not terrible but i would not buy it again . 
i wrote a 5 star review of the kiwi berry flavor that is n't usually my favorite flavor of anything , but it was surprisingly good br br orange tangerine \( which would generally be among my first picks of fruit flavored beverages is flat by comparison literally br br it seemed to lack the right amount of carbonation it also tastes weaker and too sweet br br try the kiwi berry instead . 
i really enjoyed the switch it was a lot more carbonated than most sodas and stayed that way until i finished it i was also surprised that no sugar was added since it was sweet and had real crisp , tangerine taste it was similar to sunkist pop but it tasted more like real juice i enjoyed the taste and if you have the extra money and want a healthier alternative , you might want to give it a try , but it is still 140 calories per can so it is n't exactly a diet drink and the price for the switch is about 4 times the cost of most soft drinks so i think it would be out of the range for most people 's pockets . 
8 3 ounces and a tad expensive is what i 'd say about this drink 34 grams of sugar is also a negative for me i'm not a sugar lover all in all not big enough to quench my thirst , and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more natural but not that intensely citrus . 
switch `orange tangerine' is advertized as 100 juice with carbonation they were accurate as far as the 100 juice and \( light \) carbonation goes , but imagine my disappointment when i checked the ingredients , and i read the following 100 juice \( filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates , apple , grape , tangerine , orange , and acerola juice concentrates \) br br btw acerola is also known by the common names barbados cherry and wild crapemyrtle it 's a berry that has extremely high amounts of vit c br br anyway , back to the drink when i ordered this item i was expecting a carbonated orange tangerine drink , but that was not the taste i got after all , tangerine and orange are present in smaller amounts than grape and apple juices as a result this drink had a flavor more like a mixture of sparkling grape and sparking apple combined , with somewhat of a light citrus twist , but less carbonation than either sparkling grape or sparkling apple have br br the overall flavor of switch was all right , but it was not , in my opinion orange tangerine at all in that respect this drink was a great disappointment the manufacturer would have been more accurate to name this drink fruit punch or fruit cocktail or perhaps grape apple there is , by the way , already a fruit punch version i wonder what 's in that flavor that 's not in this one \? br br the can size is just adequate at 8 3 oz , but is , i would say , fairly expensive at nearly 1 can , especially when it 's not what you thought you were getting br br the drink does , to its credit , have 100 of the recommended daily amount of vit c , and has only natural juices in it that is probably true , but this is not a diet drink just because the can says no sugar added , that does n't mean that there 's no sugar in it there happens to be a significant amount of sugar in this drink \( given the total volume you get can \) if i recall correctly the contents label said 35g of sugar that 's because 100 fruit juice is loaded with sugar , sugar like fructose br br ok , frankly , the taste combo does n't particularly appeal to me , that 's why i did n't order the grape version of this product , and now that i know what 's in the orange tangerine i would n't order it again br br i'm torn between 2 and 3 stars though , simply because it 's not really an orange tangerine drink as advertized i guess i 'll have to go with 2 stars \( i do n't know why 3 stars showed up for this product ! \? \) alas . 
i tried this along with two of my children and we all agreed that it tastes like spoiled oj but fizzier maybe it would be an acquired taste but i wo n't be drinking it again to find out br br oddly enough the black cherry version is quite good . 
how can tang be lugubrious \? if you made it a bit watered down , a bit more aftertasty , a bit less child friendly it 's an all right soda , but i do n't feel the thrill of drinking it that i did drinking tang as a child i ca n't pretend i'm an astronaut with this sometimes , advertising just helps . 
taste like tang , only more expensive i'm not a fan of tang if you love tang and want some convenience , this just might be the drink for you . 
sadly , i was supposed to receive this product , but never did i imagine it 's good given the others i 've tried , but alas , that wo n't happen still , i have to write a review , so there you go . 
here 's yet another carbonated juice drink , comparable with ooba hibiscus with orange , 16 ounce bottle \( pack of 12 \) a href http www amazon com gp product b0014x5o1c izze fortified sparkling juice , clementine , 8 4 ounce cans \( pack of 24 \) a this one , however , is an unusual combination of orange tangerine i did n't really like the flavor much though i like both orange tangerine separately but , the taste is in the bud \( s \) i prefer the izze of the 3 as for the juice , it 's more apple grape than orange tangerine the vit c is the silly recommended dose to prevent scurvy not much really \( per linus pauling \) true , it does n't have corn syrup sugar or substitutes which is nice but , at close to 1 8 3 oz it 's equivalent to about 1 50 for 12 oz \( in a pack of 24 small cans \) seems pricey to me why not just buy orange juice \? . 
i thought it would have a clean , crisp taste , but it honestly tasted just like every other orange soda i 've ever had maybe that 's deliberate maybe they 're targeting people who would otherwise drink orange soda , unless presented with a more natural alternative regardless , it tastes exactly like carbonated reconstituted juice concentrates , with some orange coloring thrown into the mix , i e , nothing special . 
the advert for switch describes it as a healthy alternative to soda and a perfect balance beween juice and carbonation to get right to it , let us tackle the first claim the can of switch i got \( orange tangerine \) was 8 3 fluid ounces those 8 3 ounces contain 36g carbs , 34g sugars and 15g sodium and packs 140 calories to put this in perspective , the 20 fluid ounce bottle of vanilla coke sitting on my desk right now contains 28g carbs , 28g sugars and 25mg sodium , and has 100 calories in other words , a bottle of conventional soda 2 5x as large has less calories , less carbs , and less sugars granted , switch has less sodium , but if we poured equivalent amounts of drink , i e 20 oz vs 20 oz , it would have much more the drawing power of switch , then , is that it boasts 100 rda of vitamin c and 20 rda of vitamin a vs 0 in these categories for coke , and that it has plenty of carbonation to satisfy the taste of soda lovers in my mind this does n't quite balance the scale br br as to the second claim i liked the balance between a fruit juice and a carbonated drink it reminded me of orangina in that it is sharp and crisp and has a bite to it , but it might strike some as too sugary sweet all in all i think this is likely to be one of those drinks that people like very much or no at all , no in betweens however , it can be considered healty only in small doses \( one can day , say \) and should be avoided by low carb dieters . 
the only good thing was that it was not sweet , but the taste was just bad i could understand and tolerate the taste if it was an energy drink , but this is not an energy drink i have been very open and have tried different carbonated orange drinks , and i have to say this is the least favorites of the 9 other carbonated orange drinks i prefer just mixing carbonated water with orange juice . 
this product is tasty it 's carbonated juice \( a blend of several juices , mostly apple , grape , tangerine \) but the 8 3 ounces costs 1 and contains 140 calories this is a little rich for me , both economically and calorically i would recommend this for someone who does n't mind spending their money and calories on juice . 
the switch orange tangerine sounded delicious when i ordered it i thought it would be very refreshing on these hot summer days and it would be if the taste were better perhaps the other flavors might be better but the orange tangerine had a bad aftertaste stick with the real juice if you want that flavor the sparkling juice idea is good , i liked the carbonation as it was refreshing br br but the biggest drawback for me is the sugar there was 34g of sugar in that little 8 oz can there is 40g in a 12 oz can of dr pepper way too much sugar br br the other drawback for me is the price i would n't buy it because it works out to be almost a dollar a can if i'm going to pay that much , i would rather buy the regular juice \( real , not reconstituted \) in the store . 
switch orange tangerine is ok but not what one might expect first of all , there is more apple and grape juice in here than orange or tangerine \( this will not be a surprise if you are familiar with the other flavors as that is also true with them \) br br switch basically is carbonated juice the taste is n't a bad and it is supposed to be healthier than soda \( which can be debated \) it is a reasonable drink for snacks but if you are going to need several if you are actually thirsty . 
unlike another product i reviewed for vine , at least this product does not have sugar per se in it it is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of \( in this order \) apple , grape , tangerine and last as well as least acai concentrate the first two on the list , apple and grape are two of the most common fruit sweeteners used in beverages etc that is why the product tastes sweetened br br it has 140 calories quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water and all of it is from carbohydrates \( 36 grams \) and over 90 of the carbs \( 34 grams \) are sugars apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of fructose a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use , but it is also known to cause diarrhea , particularly in children br br so another drink on the hit parade of pretend healthy drinks appealing to the masses' concern for their ever growing girth and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth br br you are better off drinking diet coke you would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories my favorite is bella familglia in pomegranate , lime , lemon and orange flavors and is sold from time to time on amazon as well as your local supermarket br br better yet , buy some organic pure fruit juice such as pomegranate and pour 1 8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water at least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract . 
i think the switch is a beverage with soda replacement in mind the can boasts it contains 100 of what one wants \( being all natural , 100 juice , full daily serving of vitamin c , and the clincher , carbonated \) , while having 0 of what you do n't want \( no added sugar , corn syrup , preservatives or colors \) br br the good so with that in mind , i have to agree that it is refreshing to see companies trying to fill the void in sodas with no corn syrup , with tons of juice and vitamins to boot i like that you get a full dose of vitamin c , and a little bit of a as for taste , it has a nice slightly crisp bite of carbonation , and it 's very orange tangerine y it 's a little heavy \( read syrupy without being too sweet \) , but it does have a reconstituted juice base , so it gets a pass it 's also in a single serving size can \( 8 3oz \) , which is nice considering i typically treat most 20oz bottles as a serving , even though it 's 2 and a half and i tend never do the math to figure out the true content of what i'm drinking br br the bad the price is a bit steep at about a dollar a can , it 's roughly twice the price as most 100 juices you can find , including most selections of orange juice whereas a 64 ounce carton of tropicana will run you upwards of four dollars , 8 cans of the switch would cost eight bucks for soda lovers , the switch is about twice the cost compared to your average 20oz bottle , and roughly 4 times the cost of cans \( when comparing equal amount by the ounce \) also , read the ingredients , it contains more apple and grape juice than orange or tangerine , which means that the taste is probably aided by the natural flavors \( which does n't mean oranges , just that it was derived from natural substances not chemically made \) br br the ugly the switch seems straight forward , but it 's also a little devious which leads me to my biggest complaint granted it 's all natural , but each 8oz can contains 36g of carbs , 34 of sugar alone that 's more sugar than soda , in some cases by almost 10 grams a serving more sugar \( even if it 's not corn syrup \) is more calories per can , so even at it 's single serving size you 'd almost be better off drinking a coke and taking a vitamin c pill . 
the carbonation in this drink was way too much so much in fact , that it over powered the flavor \( orange tangerine is usually very good together \) i expect this from a soda , but not a healthy drink lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink until then , i 'll pass . 
on the face of it , the switch orange tangerine beverage sounds quite good it 's a mix of concentrated fruit juices with mildly carbonated water no added sugar , preservatives or caffeine are there to annoy the health conscious you get 140 calories from one 8 3 ounce can \( probably too small a serving for most people \) there are small portions of natural flavor and coloring , gum acacia , ascorbic acid \( i e , vitamin c \) and soy in case quantities , it 's priced at under a dollar per can sounds pretty decent , right \? br br the trouble is it just does n't taste that good to me there is a vaguely unpleasant metallic quality to this stuff that i ca n't imagine many people warming up to perhaps the juice has reacted with the aluminum of the can perhaps my can had been sitting on the shelf for too long perhaps the acerola juice in the mix is an acquired taste it 's something i have n't tried before perhaps i got a bum can perhaps the switch just plain sucks i really do n't know , but i do know that i wo n't be drinking any more of it in the near future . 
it 's a small drink at just 8 3 ounces but that 's probably the size drink we should all be consuming so i wont ding it on that point it 's made with good ingredients and as it says `no sugar added' but do n't let that fool you into thinking it 's low in sugar having 34 grams a coke contains 45g of sugar but it 's almost 50 larger so even without adding sugar this is a drink that 's fully loaded in defense of the switch at least the sugar is natural with no high fructose corn syrup obviously it has no caffeine which i have some issues with so that 's a plus over soda although at 36g of carbs it seems a bit high and 140 calories is nothing to sneeze at br br so it ca n't be considered a health drink since you can get lower sugar , carbs and calories from a similar size glass of tropicana orange juice so how is the taste \? my wife described it as tasting like soap i would n't go that far but i will say the despite its good ingredients it actually tasted artificial to me i was n't a big fan and personally i'm going to stick with water and orange juice and beer . 
it has a nice taste good for sipping if you drink soda or juice with your meals , this would be a decent alternative the tangerine taste is pronounced but not overpowering the carbonation is pleasant br br however , it 's not a drink i would normally imbibe i normally drink either water or beverages sweetened with something other than sugar and this has a load of sugar yes , they say it has no added sugar that 's probably accurate but the natural sugar in the apple tangerine orange juices in this drink adds up to 34 grams compare that to the same amount of coke at 27 grams ! i checked a few other tangerine flavored sodas they all had similar amounts of sugar as switch i suppose tangerines are loaded with sugar anyway , that 's a lot more sugar than i normally drink br br if the sugar is n't an issue , this is worth checking out . 
this drink is very , very sweet , and only mildly carbonated br br i do n't drink soda , but i do occasionally like bubbles in my drinks i had some hope that switch would be a nice bubbly fruit drink to fill this need , but it 's not the ingredients may be all natural , but it 's still syrupy , and has an odd aftertaste that i think is from the added vitamin c br br for regular soda drinkers , the sweetness may not be as offensive , but for anyone expecting something that tastes like sparkling fruit juice , this will be a disappointment i 'd still choose this over an orange soda , but i 'd choose to have nothing at all rather than this br br also , note that the cans are only 8 3 ounces each , smaller than normal 12oz soda cans . 
while orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink , the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation i think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients \( tangerine is third \) is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail to my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable br br while the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely natural sugar in this or most any juice the healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins , minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you . 
i ordered this product after enjoying a previous vine acquisition a href http www amazon com gp product b00094jeuo izze sparkling clementine soda full case \( 24 12oz bottles \) a fully expecting to like it it appears that the use of 100 juice in this product makes a big difference from the izze 's use of 70 juice 30 sparkling water i like izze , but do not like switch much br br switch tastes and is just like orange juice , except it is carbonated i do not think orange juice was meant to be carbonated it just does n't add anything to the taste or consistency that i found enjoyable it also left a lengthy aftertaste of juice burps which i did not enjoy so it is not that the makes have done anything wrong or poor quality , it is just that this reviewer did not like how the concept worked out . 
switch is a decent soda , and definitely worth considering for those who want mainly natural ingredients but i think it is overstating it a bit when the switch can claims 100 of what you want and 0 of what you do n't want or is soy something i would expect or want in a soda \? br br for my personal taste , this switch flavor \( which was the only one i tried \) was too sweet it is hard to believe that there is no sugar added to that stuff br br so ok , but not great i prefer a href http www amazon com gp product b000nu4vso izze sparkling pomegranate soda 4 pk \( 4 12 ounce bottles \) a or any of the izze flavors over switch . 
well , my husband , myself and my 12 year old son sampled this drink my husband hated it i felt like it was ok , but nothing to write home about the taste to me was too orangey and for a natural product it sure did n't taste like one my 12 year old liked it he also likes gummy worms and sour straws , so you can take his review for what it is br br i personally would n't buy this product br 2 stars . 
to be blunt , i was throughly underwhelmed with this product and i am finding it hard to come up the words to describe why , but the problem is that orange switch does n't have a lot going for it , so there is n't a lot one can say about it br br to me , this product is canned orange juice and club soda , packaged in a trendy little can br br and like all canned orange juice \( blue bird brand , et al \) there is an off taste to it that reminds you it is n't fresh squeezed juice add to that this fizzy aspect , and its just kinda , well , there br br i ca n't say that this is a healthy drink orange juice has some of the highest concentrations of sugars for a fruit drink and its cost per can is steep , especially when compared to making this stuff at home with club soda and fresh squeezed juice br br i ca n't give it one star i would reserve that for something undrinkable as amazon requires a minimum one star to do a review so my two star rating should be taken to mean that you can drink it and its unoffensive , but thats about all you can say about it . 
a nutritionist once told me she could find something good about every food except soda pop is full of co2 \( carbon dioxide \) , something our body is trying to get rid of , and refined sugar \( which can ruin the teeth and provides empty calories \) but even so , i still love it i love the fizz tingling down my throat while while cleaning my palate and replacing it with sweetness nutri sweet brings down the calories at the expense of flavor and has side effects like headaches and giving me a gnawing hunger br br for fun occasions , i 'll mix lemon lime or plain soda water with juices for a delightful , and slightly healthier alternative to soda will the switch orange tangerine soda live up to my expectations \? a carbonated juice in a can \? br br at first glance , the switch can is cute it 's a slender can with nice artwork fun to hold in your hand when you 're used to the typical can br br but when i taste it , i'm sorry to say , i'm a little disappointed the orange tangerine switch soda is not as tasty as regular orange soda , nor as orange juice for a disclaimer , i 'll mention that orange juice is not something that would normally taste great carbonated , so the other flavors of switch might taste better i got a kind of odd , bitter taste as i drunk the soda , but afterwards there was a pleasant aftertaste the bitterness might be present in regular soda , but this is orange juice \( with some others mixed in \) and i know how it tastes without carbonation br br i gave the switch soda to both of my daughters who happily swigged it down with no concern from the odd taste i noticed br br so while i wo n't be happily exchanging my occasional soda for switch , i'm glad they are trying to do something a little healthier than we can feel more comfortable giving our children and really , on a hot day , this would hit the spot . 
i gave this a try because i love carbonated juice stuff like bottled cranberry , apple , grape from welch 's and the like br br personally i liked this pretty well , though not as much as some other brands to me , it tastes and smells like tangerine , and i felt like i could kind of taste some of the component flavors making it up the flavor is more complex than you 'd get from a fruit flavored soda the carbonation is pretty light br br i definitely would n't mind trying some of `the switch 's other flavors but , i split some of the tangerine flavor with a relative , and she thought it smelled like jell o , and did n't care for it she said she 'd rather have regular juice br br i definitely liked this better than orange soda though ! . 
if you like your drink not so smooth and a bit tangy this should work for you but alas ! not for me . 
ouch , this stuff is sweet , as in really sweet this is really harsh tasting and we were disappointed most soda does n't have this much sugar , the 8 3 oz can has 29 grams of sugar , yikes ! for a 12 oz can of soda , that would be like having 45 grams of sugar , who would drink that \? br br they need to water this way down , we 're going to end up giving the rest of this away , we ca n't drink it . 
the only way we could make switch orange tangerine drinkable was mixing 50 50 with club soda it was just way too sweet it then tasted good , but orangina and san pelligrino both have awesome orange flavored sodas out there with no need to mix ! and surprisingly , imported san pelligrino comes out to be cheaper because the cans are larger \( 11 3 oz as opposed to 8 oz \) . 
the product description says that it 's just juice , bubbles and vitamin c really , it 's just the last two it 's not entirely flavorless , but i 've tasted plenty of beverages that are much better than this one with a lot less carbonation br br and , honestly , this healthy drink is rather easily replaced by a multivitamin pill it 's not really good for you , it 's just not directly bad for you sincerely , i'm fairly sure that sucking on my couch cushions would garner you more nutrition than a mountain dew , so it 's not like better than soda is really setting the bar high br br rather disappointing , particularly compared to the other switch beverages . 
first , i wish i had gotten two can samples of this product so i could try one with some bourbon i find almost everything mixes with bourbon except tomato juice br br ok what i liked nice fruit flavor strong but not overpowering the carbonation was ok not flat , which was nice did not tickle my nose as champagne does br br i did not care for the can taste i felt there was a slight metallic aftertaste really , that was the only thing i did n't like this product would probably taste better in glass rather than aluminum maybe i am overly picky br br overall , not sure i liked it enough to order it again . 
i think i liked a similar drink but this one is just there it 's bubbly it 's sort of orange flavored it has a sharpness but there 's nothing about it that excites me it 's a good old fashioned carbonated beverage and if it 's inexpensive buy it if it 's significantly more expensive than most drinks , leave it buy coke instead . 
this is a beverage that is different from the other beverages out there it starts with a nice citrus zing but then finishes with a little sweet i was hoping for the zing to continue or get more full but it died br br the overall taste is not as sweet as an orange soda and not as citrus as an izze or similar citrus beverage br br overall , this is in between and as such is not going to be my pick as i will usually want one or the other br br not bad , but not what i want . 
switch is n't a bad product , but it 's not great either i like the fact that it 's all natural sparkling juice , and the can design is pleasant to look at br br the orange tangerine is n't bad this flavor is n't as syrupy as some of switch 's others however , at 140 calories per can , this beverage has 50 more calories per ounce than the average soda too many for me . 
it 's not bad good ingredients for a change so that 's a plus taste is okay but not great i would drink it if offered , but doubt i 'd buy it . 
i sampled this product with some reservations carbonated fruit juice \? my wife said that it would probably be something like orangina , but since i'm not particularly fond of orangina that did n't help me much i then remembered that i had no problem drinking sparkling grape juice so this might not be so bad after all i sampled this product cold , as warm fruit juice and warm soda are both bad ideas no matter what the flavor br br i was very surprised to discover that i enjoyed this quite a bit i expected there to be some acidity to it , given the orange and tangerine combination , and found none i did find it surprisingly sweet considering that there 's no added sugar it was not , in fact , entirely unlike your garden variety orange soda with a smoother finish there was a slight and very brief metallic aftertaste which i first assumed was from drinking it right from the can , but after a second taste from a drinking glass the aftertaste remained still , it 's not enough to put me off from drinking it br br the one thing that did put me off was the price i 'll admit that i'm something of a cheap drinker i have a hard time , for example , going to the grocery store and buying a half gallon of lemonade for 2 50 when i can buy a 2 bottle of lemon juice and a 2 50 bag of sugar and make two gallons of lemonade and still have three pounds of sugar left over i always do the math and price out what i'm drinking \( do you have any idea how much money coke makes off those 20 oz bottles \? ! \? \) so for this product , 23 for a 24 pack comes out to 96 per 8 3 ounce can , or about 12 per ounce a half gallon of tropicana orange tangerine juice at the local supermarket is 3 80 , or about 6 per ounce i happen to have a carbonator and chargers are about 40 cents apiece , and it would take 2 3 chargers to do the entire half gallon , so all said and done it would cost me about 8 per ounce to make my own carbonated orange tangerine drink , so it 's about 2 3 the cost to make it myself \( no , i did n't factor in the cost of the carbonator itself so that could be considered loading the dice \) br br so i guess the bottom line here is , if you 're really big on the whole carbonated orange tangerine thing then you can either buy this product and not be disappointed , or you can make a very close approximation of it yourself for about 65 of the cost \( assuming you have a carbonator \) or , you can buy a two liter bottle of house brand orange soda for a buck at your local supermarket and get much the same experience while saving about 22 in the process . 
when i saw the switch orange tangerine was available , i knew i had to try it i liked the kiwi strawberry quite well \( better than some other reviewers did , it seems \) , so i was sure i would enjoy this one just as much br br the initial taste of this orange tangerine carbonated juice is rather tart , and the carbonation just seems to make it more tart the aftertaste is rather pleasant , so if the aftertaste is what you 're looking for in a drink , this is the drink for you my wife thought it tasted a bit like champagne , if that 's any indication of what to expect from this drink br br the flavor is different , and not at all what i expected not very refreshing at all i would buy the kiwi berry drink , but i think i 'll take a pass on the orange tangerine in the future . 
this was the most potent orange drink i have ever had it might be 100 juice , but this drink has some kick br br there are no artificial sweeteners in this drink , but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation could n't cute into the sugary flavor br br it was way too strong for me and i thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste , but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange tangerine , this is the drink for you . 
energy drinks are very popular these days most , if not all , are loaded with sugar , various overloads of vitamins , and varying energy blends a few energy drinks have tried adding pure juice , but have only come up with 50 at most br br if your not a young'un and ca n't handle that blast of sugar and crash that follows , then switch is a better alternative switch is 100 juice , zero sugar , and lots of vitamin c br br switch is carbonated , so with the orange tangerine flavor , picture your morning juice with a little soda fizzle the taste is sweet , but not sugary although the size of the can probably relates to the recommended serving , most people probably do n't have this little juice in one sitting br br soda fizzle meets juice benefits it 's a no brainer how about some more flavors \? . 
i was looking forward to this tea , but unfortunately the mint overpowers the hibiscus and essentially makes this just another kind of mint tea i prefer the hibiscus tart be the star of the show in a hibiscus based tea \( aka herbal infusion \) and in my opinion , mint and tropical do n't mix and now know going forward to pay more attention to the ingredients still worth 3 stars because it can be a refreshing tea on a hot day , but just not a great tropical hibiscus tea . 
i like the taste of this dressing , but realized that it contains the additive mono sodium gluconate this chemical gives me migraines , which is very difficult to tolerate i am sorry to say that i will no longer purchase this dressing unless they remove this flavor enhancer . 
work well and made solidly for whatever reason the keurig takes longer to complete the brewing cycle when using these cups and the liquid bleeds through the filter on the outside of the cup making a small mess they do the job as intended but could use a different type of filter to make the experience less messy . 
disposakups great idea , because k kups are expensive and are n't necessarily available in your favorite coffee br br disposakups fit well into the keurig coffee maker , the lid snaps on firmly to the disposakup after you fill it with your favorite coffee or tea however , the problem comes with the filter which wicks the hot coffee under pressure out of the disposakup from under the lid br br i tried several of these disposakups after the first few leaked i thought maybe i was not snapping the lid on tight enough , so i made up some more disposakups and made sure the lids were on really tight , no gaps ! they still leaked about 5 or 6 drops from each disposakup , which then drips outside the k kup holder chamber and outside the catch area i needed to clean up around the coffee maker after use br br i give this item 3 stars because they do work , and are a great idea , but the design of the filter protruding from around the cap causes the leaking if you do n't mind a bit of cleanup after each use you 'll appreciate these br br i 'll use the rest of the box , and continue cleaning up after each use , but i wo n't buy more br br the seller offered a refund , but it would cost me almost as much to send them back as i would receive as a refund . 
work ok main problem they leak out the top a bit as well as inside the machine is it worth the extra work \? it is if you want to pay a fraction of the cos of a k cup plus you can use any coffee you desire . 
these seemed like a great idea i would be able to load up 50 k cups with any type of coffee i chose , and still maintain the speed of using the store bought cups in my rush to get ready every morning after waiting a month for this product to reach me \( 20 days before they even shipped it ! \) i finally found it on my doorstep br br upon opening the box my hopes lifted even higher these are solid little cups of a much higher quality than i expected i filled one and snapped the lid down i ensured it was sealed all the way around , placed it in my kuerig , and hit the brew button at first it seemed to be working splendidly then coffee began pouring out of places it is n't supposed to by the time it was over i had quite a mess to clean up upon opening the kuerig i found the disposakup completely in tact and the lid still secured properly however the bit of overhanging filter was soaked , dripping , and hot ! i had discovered the source of the leak i have tried again several times with the same reoccurring problem i guess i should have bought the ecobrew cup after all br br if you like the appearance of convenience , and the reality of spending more time cleaning up a mess this is the product for you br br \( i went ahead and gave it two stars because i like the idea of the product so much \) . 
nice idea to create self filling cups for those who own keurig brewers but want to use their own bagged coffee , or those who do not want to incur the high cost of purchasing pre made brewing cups the idea is , one takes a plastic cup , puts in the pre molded filter , adds one 's own coffee grounds , closes the cup with the lid and then pops the cup into the brewer , disposing of it at the end however the plastic on the cups is a bit flimsy , such that if one pushes too hard down on the lid , the entire cup collapses , accordion style another drawback is that the lids do not fit snugly without careful maneuvering , so that it can take longer than one might expect to close the cups these two problems defeating the purpose of fast which is basically the primary advantage of keurig brewers in the first place another advantage of the brewer is the lack of a mess , which these cups also do not address well there is always coffee left to either drip down or on top of the lid following brewing which requires cleanup of the cup holder granted it is not major clean up , but nevertheless and finally , the potential advantage of cost savings the cups appear to be relatively inexpensive , but add in the cost of shipping and handling , which is some 6 on top of the featured price \( about 50 more \) , and the per cup price increases try purchasing multiple packages to reduce shipping cost no go , the company just doubles the cost of shipping one package ergo , if you were to say order 100 cups , you would pay more than 30 dollars and a third would be shipping and handling in addition to the other problems with the design , it more or less defeats the purpose large packages of the pre made pods can be purchased for nearly the same per pod cost would not recommend these , until the company lowers shipping costs , improves design , or both you 're better off just using the mesh filter pod that comes with your brewer , and simply rinsing it out same time involved , less cost and lower environmental impact . 
the first shipment i received of this item was great lids fit easily this last shipment , either the lids are slightly larger or the cups are smaller the lids are extremely hard to get on if i press too hard the cup starts to buckle i 've actually started to use a pair of pliers to get the lids on ! . 
i decided to give these a try the lids are very difficult to put on and i often ended up bending the cup while trying to affix the lid they do not seal perfectly and i often found unexpected puddles , but they do the job since i have a keurig permanant filter i thought of just buying the paper filters to save on cleanup for almost 11 from this vendor , you can get 50 \( fifty \) paper filters i would just assume use paper towels that works out to be just under 25 cents for a small piece of paper disposakups , please re evaluate your pricing ! . 
these cups work for the most part except for the fact that all most all of them leak out the top of the cap all seem to wick some leakage through the paper filter at the cap and cup joint and approximately 10 15 overflow and leak around the cup and down the sides providing some grounds with the coffee . 
caused my cuisinart k cup brewer to leak every time i used it great idea , just needs some adjustments so that the coffee maker works properly with it . 
i like the disposakups if i'm fixing more than one cup , it 's quicker to use the disposakups than it is to clean out the refillable holder , which came with my machine . 
i was very excited to see a product such as this being offered on line , as i loved the coffee i was drinking before i got a keurig \( my previous coffee is not offered in a k cup version \) very promptly i placed an order and could n't wait for it to arrive i placed my fresh beans into my grinder and ground them a little courser than i would have if i was using my bunn coffee pot i then proceeded to place the filter into the disposable k cup , add my freshly ground beans and placed the cap on tightly great ! ! ready to brew my first cup of my favorite coffee the whole procedure worked well until the cycle was almost finished and then it happened scalding hot water started squirting out of my keurig machine from all sides i was trying to move my cup to catch the water , but it was coming out too fast and very hot i was disappointed with the performance of this product the coffee was good , although not a full cup and i had a mess to clean i have tried grinding the beans finer and courser , also tried to fill the cups at different levels , but the results are still the same i will continue experimenting with the disposable k cups and if i find the right combination , i will let you know . 
product is , as advertised , a good way to utilize your own coffee blends it is easy to fill and prepare for use , however , it sometime leaks at the end of the brewing process . 
it is difficult to judge the amount and grind of coffee to put in the k cups if it is too fine a grind or is too packed full it only give you a half of a cup . 
i recently purchased disposakups from this seller ! not only did i receive great customer service and fast shipping , but my product came packaged perfectly i absolutely love the idea of the disposakups however , after using a few , they just do n't live up to my expectations the lid often gets stuck in the keurig when its done brewing , sometimes the holes do n't poke properly , and every time i am left with water spewing out in all directions while it brews definitely not a replacement for myk or solofill . 
i purchased this product for a couple of reasons first , with the cost of k cups , this offered a lower price option second , this allows me to used the coffee of my choice \( decaf , organic , water processed \) br br the first couple of times i used these , the coffee was very weak i opened a regular k cup that i had to see if there was a difference in grind size from what i was using there was not then i poured the contents of the k cup into my disposable k cup and it would not fit apparently , the disposable cups hold less coffee , which could account for the weakness i also noticed that the disposable cups leak around the rim , and i often get grounds in my cup br br i started packing as much coffee as i could into the cups , to where i could barely get the top on this made a much better cup of coffee however , they still leaked , there were still grounds in my coffee , and it make my keurig run much slower not to mention the cleanup br br my business uses a keurig so that all of us can brew the coffee of our choice , and we also have a couple of tea and hot chocolate drinkers everytime i use the disposable cups , i have to wipe down the machine , drip tray my cup i also have to clean out the interior of the cup recepticle so that the next person does n't have to put up with my leftovers all in all , these were a nice idea , but the amount of work they require makes paying a little exta for the convenience of regular k cups more attractive i will probably use up what i have and then go back to the regular k cups or find a more landfill friendly solution . 
the lids do not fit coffee runs out of the pod a total waste of money there are other filters on the market that are much better . 
i will start by being kind , it is a good idea to save money with an item or concept like this it makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre filled commercial k cups you buy at the store br br now , i received my disposakups over a month after ordering them and put them to use i was immediately disappointed , filters did not hold very much coffee , it was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup the coffee was very weak br br this product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made k cups the body and lids are plastic normal k cups do not have a plastic lid notice they say 100 disposable so put them in the trash they are not recyclable landfill br br they are not convenient , they are a bit messy , a pain to put together and still expensive not worth it ! there are better alternatives out there that will save you money , make better coffee and not go into a landfill br br sorry , i wish i had better news , i think i will return these . 
the product stinks and that 's mildly stated the caps do not snap on easily and if you apply too much pressure the cup part caves in and you end up with ground coffee everywhere i threw the whole order into the trash and called it a day i will be using professionally produced k cups \( i e , dunkin donuts , starbucks , even folgers \) from this point on . 
i was so excited to get these k cups and immediately filled 10 , for future brewing , with my favorite coffee i tried one right away the coffee started running down the front of my kreuig i thought i had filled the cup wrong and maybe not had the lid sealed well enough but when the coffee was done i opened the k cup slot and found a melted wrinkled container i have subsequently tried more of the orrigional 10 that i filled , after carefully checking that they were properly put together , and all melted in the same way i have since thrown the rest away because i was tired of the mess they created ! do n't buy these they do not stand up to hot water . 
for product to work properly \( imho \) you need coffee ground as fine as possible once filter has been inserted , plave carefully leveled measure of coffee in it manuever lid into place , then press down on center steadily w thumb br br plan to use no more than 6 oz of water for your cup br br removal of used cup from machine is occasional problem \( jiggle it and it will generally loosen up \) . 
the solo k cup works perfectly instead of these i totally agree with the poor performance review i also got coffee grounds in my cup everytime i used these \( yes even with the filter \) the cup is poorly designed it clogged the system causing the water to back up producing a half cup of coffee or water spilling outside the top of the unit . 
the products lid stays attached to the needle on the keurig , allowing coffee grounds to fall everywhere very messy if this did n't happen , it would work well . 
these cups were difficult to cap \( putting the lids on securely was a comedy show \) and they created a mess when used in the keurig the water went everywhere add together pia and mess with an end outcome of weak cup o' joe i'm not a very happy buyer . 
the lids are impossible to secure this purchase was a complete waste of money product cannot be used as lids are unable to be secured . 
they look like a good idea my wife and i thought we would give them a try they are pretty easy to use the thing we do n't like is the mess they make in the machine even when to top is secure , they leak into the machine you have to keep cleaning the filter basket or it gets sticky i would advise you to use something better like the e z cup . 
looking at all the disposable reusable k cup designs i think i will forgo purchasing any at this time and continue to use my tried and true free method br free after the cost of an original k cup br br after using your k cup filled with coffee that you 've purchased br br take off the aluminum lid that seals the top br empty grounds into the trash or compost br rinse out the inside you will see there is already a filter inside br fill with your own coffee br place a small square of aluminum foil on top and be sure to make it tight and sealed around the top edges of the cup br br now reuse your cup a few times or many , it 's up to you as long as the filter holds up just re do all the steps for each cup you make . 
i ordered the disposa kups with the thought of making my own kups they do n't fit together without a big production the lids wo n't fit and water comes out the top of the brewer lid as well as the kcup just a big mess not what i wanted at all want to return them and get a refund donna phillips . 
we use the k caps so that we can re use our k cups by refilling them with the coffee we like we have lost or given away several of the caps over the 2 years that we 've been using them so i thought i would buy some more k caps it turns out , the prices for them have increased substantially so i went in search of another alternative that would be less expensive i found these and thought i had found the answer but they do n't quite work as well as the original k cups they actually caused the keurig to spew water in directions other than the intended direction and then allowed enough coffee grounds to escape that the holder for the cups became clogged and had to be disassembled and thoroughly cleaned before it could be used again good idea but not quite right . 
i am sorry to say i had trouble with the cups themselves each time i used them , my machine would say decalcify which i did the first time when i used them the 2nd and 3rd times , the problem occurred again i was able to clear the hot water spout with a toothpick , which remedied the problem i will not use them again , though , because i do n't want to have to do that after every use . 
this is what is needed to use with finely ground coffees it works well with none fine ground coffee i prefer using my solo fill cups they are easier to use i have had six for some time and have had no problem except when using fine ground coffee . 
the units go together easily , but no matter how much or little coffee i put in the filter , it caused overflow it 's as if the filters are too thick i also had a few cups that did n't pierce correctly definitely not worth the money for these ! . 
these little cups are a waste of money the kerug machine had a difficult time processing the coffee through the cup , and as a result i ended up with several half cups of coffee br br i tried it about 10 times , and then gave up . 
i got coffee grounds in my cup 4 out of the 5 times i used these very disappointed because i would like to use my coffee the hole punctured in the bottom is larger than the one punched out with the regular k cups , probably due to the design on the bottom of the cup i have to flush the system each time i have used this product , wasting time and water . 
i tried these disposakups several times , and each time the filter came loose at the top resulting in coffee and grounds everywhere the kup and lid are both made from flimsy plastic that softens at the brewing temperature the result is a loose fit at the top during brewing , distortion of kup at the bottom \( because filter is forced down \) and coffee and grounds everywhere the lids work one time with oem keurig kups \( cleaned and refilled \) , but the second time they are loose and result in overflow an email to the company for a refund was not answered do not buy these ! . 
neat concept other contraptions to use your own coffee have prepunched holes and are designed much differently than the k cup this is like a do it yourself k cup however , because this consists of a disposable cup , filter , and a cap and is punched by the brewer , i would not be surprised if this mechanism infringed on keurig 's patents oh , and the video review submitted by the other reviewer looks suspiciously like the video on the manufacturers website \) . 
bought a pack of a 100 of these and each cup it takes so long to process the coffee each cup i get coffee grounds in and not a whole cup of coffee great concept , i believe the paper filter is to fine which holds back the coffee and pressure which results in bleeding of coffee grounds out of the 2 other holes regular k cups work work much better again great idea , just not so great of a product . 
first of all , i thought i could save money filling my own keurig k cups by the time i bought the fillable cups , paid shipping and bought coffee to put in them , i was already in the hole br if all you have to do is fill these little cups all day i guess it will work for you , because you can have the coffee of your choice the other problem was is they get stuck in the brewer when you try to take them out br i still have about thirty left , and when they are gone i will not replace them . 
i thought these would be the perfect answer sadly , i guess the pressure with which my keurig machine shoots the water through the k cup is too much for the disposa cup , because every single time i tried it , coffee grounds were spewed up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k cup sits in my keurig and yes , i used them properly br br so the issue , at least in my keurig machine , seems to be with the lids some have suggested its a design flaw with the keurig machine in either case , these disposa cups were not the answer for me br br biggest waste of money ever i cannot recommend . 
i bought this through amazon because most items i have purchased through them have been great this product is the exception they are very difficult to seal or close once filled , and they make one huge mess of your machine this product is just not ready for prime time also , it is n't a cheap product the filters leak out of the sides which i do n't understand as it ca n't be sealed any better than i have been doing most important , and this is important , it is made in china , so you just ca n't be sure that it is free of chemicals that are released during the brewing process other products clearly state that they are chemical free i ca n't remember if it bth or bht , but take that into consideration buy something else please . 
the service and delivery from amazon was great however , the product itself is not worth buying no matter what i try , coffee leaks out around the kcup when brewing it makes a mess ! wanted the cups to use my favorite coffee \( tim hortons \) , but guess i 'll just have to get used to other brands ! . 
my sister bought a keurig we all started using it but mom still had her cans of coffee i did n't want them to go to waste , so i bought this figuring i could make her k cups with her own coffee the cups are flimsy , first of all \( most of them buckle too easily while getting the top on \) it looks like a good seal \( and yes , i made sure there were no coffee grounds on the edge , which i know can screw up the seal \) , but they still leak get one of the reusable cups it 'll be better for you and your keurig . 
the lids keep popping off when the cup fills up with water , the only i have not tried is putting 2 holes in bottom of the cup so that the water might flow out faster it 's a damn mess getting coffee grounds in your cup ! i would not buy anymore of them , unless i can fix the problem ! ! ! ! ! no more disposebale k cups for me ! . 
we put together the cups everything went well with t he coffee into the cups along with a filter br when putting the kcup into the coffee machine it would only drip i checked everything and it was put together correctly i took the made up cups to my son 's coffee maker keurig brand also , it did the same thing it starts out ok only made drips of coffee br we tried it with two different modes of keurig and both did not work it did make holes in right places . 
i was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original k cups , but was very disappointed in the product though the cups came with no instructions , it was apparent that you just put the filter in , add coffee , then pop the lid on trouble is , the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup , but when doing that i found it impossible to seal the cups so i had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid after doing that and trying , the coffee ran very slow though the k cup and after only about three cups , the keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working i cleaned out with vinegar and tried again , but same result i ended up throwing these away as it did n't seem worth the effort to return them not a good product ! . 
i was really hoping that your product would solve my discontent with the keurig coffe maker that i received for xmas i am a coffee and chicory drinker so of course i wanted to have the same great coffee thru the keurig machine the mesh filter that i bought first left a slimed residue in the brew so i believed that the paper filter you created would do the job well it does it 's work properly but it is a little large for the keurig device so water and grinds sort of go everywhere i dont think your product isnt good the whole keurig experience is a great disappointment ! . 
i recieved my diposakups and was a little disappointed first , they took quite awhile to arrive in the mail , however when i was tracking the product , it did say that it would take some time to deliver i have the keurig cuisinart , and the cups work ok , but they do n't allow the machine to finish the brewing process it does n't allow the hinge to completely close , which wo n't let the machine complete the brewing i have to take the cup out in order for it to finish however , it is very convenient and makes it much more cost effective , but i do n't know that i would buy them again because i'm worried i may ruin my machine . 
these k cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made k cups i now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the k cup and puncture it again for the water to come through i think the material in the disposable k cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom . 
i'm not happy with these reusuable cups ! they do n't hold enough coffee so when using the keuring system , i get a small cup of coffee intead of the middle button i hope keurig comes out with a better reusable k cup holder . 
i was looking for a simple and inexpensive way to provide my own supply of home made k cups this product is all that it is described to be fairly easy to use and does not adversely affect the cup of coffee clearly , the cups and lids are in fact reusable albeit a little messy br i have used all 50 filters so i am at a point where i need to decide if i want to continue on with this regimen or go to plan b br i am electing to try one of the reusable style cups that do n't require the use of a filter my hope is that it will be a little quicker and less messy to use br however , if plan b does not meet my expectations i can always order another supply of filters and continue on with this disposacups system . 
the basic problem with this product is that unless you load a very small amount of coffee in the filter , the filter clogs this causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and cause a mess my son and i spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have admitted defeat i suspected the filter but i used filters which work perfectly fine in my ez cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter even worse , coffee grounds in my coffee ! however , if you like your coffee very weak , this will work well for you i hope they can fix the design issues until then , i will stick with my ez cup . 
the cups are a little tight for my machine you have to press down on the handle really hard also the lids do n't fit properly unless the filter is pushed down all the way into the cup . 
good , easy to use , somewhat hard to get the caps on , but at the end you can easily dispose of these disposable kups after using br br good that you can use your own coffee fresh coffees i personally like coffees from spain , puerto rico and other countries br br the bad , sometimes is messy coffee grinds seem to leak , creating a slight mess and the need to clean the machine this leak is more in the area of the kups lid and cup and some times these grinds even get in your cup of coffee just read other reviews about this not sure if it could be related to how fine are the grinds of coffee br br on the other hand , with disposable kups you do n't need to keep cleaning wire filter baskets that 's a very plus br br all considered will probably buy again , but wish a better lid cup seal that will not leak hope down the road they will offer improved disposablekups . 
thought this might be a nice alternative to use with my favorite coffee , but was sadly disappointed it leaked all over no matter what we tried and the coffee was weak , machine clogged with most attempts and water would n't brew thru at times the cup even melted a little leaving a nasty taste in the coffee br br go with the greener alternative and try the ekobrew much better results and no waste . 
not thrilled with these doubt i will buy them again lid does n't fit very well messy and did not make a good cup of coffee cost including shipping to me was 36 filter cup plus coffee do n't think it is worth it as i can buy a green mountain k cup for around 54 cup and they are perfect every time . 
i purchased this item as an alternative to traditional k cups in an attempt to save money however , this product did not work well in my machine i followed the directions and read reviews to see what works best , but was not able to use the k cups effectively the cup itself is too weak and warps in my machine i compared the shape before and after and there is a big difference this k cup seems to expand horizontally and vertically because the plastic is not strong enough also , the k cup is shaped differently from the traditional k cup this is neccessary because it does not use foil as a topper , but does not seem to work in the end , i had to clean up several coffee explosions in my kitchen to figure out how it works , but still could not use it effectively maybe i am not doing something correctly , but i'm sure there is also an issue with the product itself while i do like the idea , i would not suggest purchasing this product until the bugs are worked out . 
i bought these for my pittie who is on a sweet potato and fish diet i thought they would be a little larger , but they are more suitable for a smaller breed dog they were even a little small for my pug who gulped them down and i was afraid she would choke on them . 
i thought i was purchasing a high quality item but it 's not all that the chocolate is very sweet and as you chew on this product you can tell the chocolate is loaded with sugar by the crunchy texture i'm going to say it 's not worth the money and i'm not satisfied br at the same time of purchasing this product i also bought sunmaid chocolate covered raisons which i rate from a 1 10 a 10 now we are talking about yumminess ! ! ! ! ! br so customers if you are going to choose let it be the sunmaid you wo n't be dissappointed . 
my seth is a huge fan of spicy things , the hotter the better i was hoping these would go over really well , and be a regular snack he likes them , but just that i got him the ass kickin' snack mix , and he devoured it , wolfing it down , so we 'll stick with that i 'd still consider this a great buy if you love peanuts and it 's a great price . 
well , at least they live up to their name these nuts are definitely hot , too bad that 's all the positive i have to say about them other than that , they taste like cardboard , and not very good cardboard either . 
i am attracted to reliable consumables which do not vary much from batch to batch i expect the single malt scotch i purchase this month will be similar to the one i bought six months ago , all things remaining the same in my experience , i have had ahmad earl grey tea that 's knocked off my socks with a rich flavor , filled with the bergamot that attracts me to earl grey the box i'm currently drinking is so full of tannin and void of essence of bergamot that i do n't know if it will actually be drunk all boxes i 've had contained tea bags with an ample amount of tea and each produces a satisfactory little teapot full of caramel colored tea , but i am having difficulty drinking the second cups from this box because the tea powder residue remains instead of enjoying an afternoon of relaxation , i develop a stomach ache , so i'm now skipping the entire second cup the tea was recently purchased , so staleness is likely not an issue . 
made in china br even our dog food has gone the way of the hershey kiss i wo n't be back to this vendor br will be looking for made and sold in america only . 
my experience br br it 's very translucent , with just a light golden color it smells like you 'd expect a peach to smell , but the taste hints of a white grape juice , though it has no grape in it and tastes more peachy over time , especially as it warms up it 's tingly on the tongue , but does n't foam up it 's slightly drier than your average juice , with a hint of bitterness , probably from the carbonation br br did i like it yes , though not as much as their offering in pomegranate apple , a 6 out of 10 my wife does n't like it so much . 
i eat mixed nuts all the time at work they make a healthy snack instead of the donuts , etc that are always around the plus side of these is that they are much lower salt than usual the down side is that they are almost all cashews very few brazil nuts , pecans and it is a miracle to find a macadamia nut the lack of variety is disappointing . 
the price was comparable to walmart for same size product however these nuts were not as crunchy and they needed a little more salt . 
they do not taste like a good high quality nut , i dont know if it was the lack of salt but they were not for me . 
i would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts these are just average quality , and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful the only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans there are barely any pecans , but tons of cashews try another brand as i am sure there is something better out there . 
these are a cheap fake nothing like the real emerald nuts you buy in the store its a complete waste of money dont get ripped off like i did . 
i love izze sprarkling juice , it is amazing my favorite flavors would have to be apple and blueberry i was curious to try the grapefuit one though because someone told me it tastes like fresca , and i love fresca i tried it and in no way does it taste like fresca , its much milder then fresca and not a very strong grapefruit flavor at all i found it to lack in the grapefruit flavor but more of a peach flavor to be honest i have not tried the peach one yet but i am guessing it tastes like the grapefruit one d lol oh well , i am just not a big fan of peach drinks if you are someone who likes a milder taste of grapefruit then you will love this , its very smooth i dont like very smooth so this is not my favorite , i like my drink to have a bite to it it is ok , but i will stick to blueberry and apple from now on the really awesome thing about these drinks though is they are lower calorie then your normal juice , all natural and no added sugar , and each glass bottle has 2 servings of fruit , you cant beat that . 
good quality product , but you would have to really love curry flavor to like these they are so awful i do n't know what to do with them , but i know i wo n't be eating them i 'll stick to the plain sea salt ones \) . 
unfortunately i am completely disappointed with this product i have an above average sense of smell , but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food perhaps i received part of a faulty batch \? the seller is letting me return the bottle , but is requiring that i pay for shipping again , so i would be very unlikely to order from them again . 
lacks the flavor i was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level i wo n't be ordering this again live and learn . 
all of the positive reviews led me to believe this popcorn was going to be really great truth is , i am disappointed the popcorn kernels are tough , chewy and lack any great corn taste i want popcorn that snaps when you bite into it i will go back to buying the premium orville redenbacher 's brand at my local grocery . 
so far i'm not impressed with this popcorn it 's tender when popped , but it 's really annoying how much does n't pop i'm going to add a little water and then let it sit , closed up , for a while and see if that helps as of right now , i would n't buy this popcorn again . 
these are supposed to be cherry and brandy filled chocolates if they contain brandy , it is too subtle for me to detect a clue to the cause may be the stickiness of the package and the cracks in the candies it appears they were mistreated at some point and may have leaked but the box they came in shows no damage a friend speculated that airline decompression burst them maybe , but other imported chocolates do n't suffer this problem br br i should also mention that the chocolate tastes a little bit dusty on the outside br br i ca n't really recommend these laroshell candies there are other brands which are quite good . 
i enjoyed the dry roasted part , but the onion garlic combination was a little overwhelming for me i thought that they would be a little more toasted than they were the flavor was more of an after taste and my wife shied away from my kisses after i ate them bummer ! i am looking for something else . 
i do like the idea of these crackers for gluten free eating , but i ca n't bring myself to enjoy them i bought the 6 pack variety and have tried the maple cinnamon and the onion garlic i generally like flax , but these just are n't setting well with me even when i use them as a carrier for dips i feel i wasted my money i 'll probably give the unopened packs to a friend 's family that are gluten free . 
the flavors are really good but the crackers get a bit slimy as you chew them if that does n't bother you , then they 're a great low carb snack . 
i bought a bottle of tapatio hot sauce for my friend to have it shipped over to her in the east coast the order said it 'd take 5 business days it ended up taking over 3 weeks . 
you know i really do love this product i wish i could give the tea 5 stars because it really does brew up a very pleasant tasting iced tea that needs little sugar or other embellishments the problem is it 's loose and when you are trying to make a big jug of it with two packets of tea it is a huge mess to strain and ordinary double mesh strainer is not fine enough i do n't have coffee strainers in the house so i had to line a mess strainer with paper towels and it took forever to strain but when i strained it with just my mesh strainer there was a ton of tea in the jug i wish the variety pack came pre bagged like the smaller boxes of tea do . 
i bought this item thinking it might be equivilent to starbucks or davinci hazelnut syrup but it 's not at first it tastes like hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale the price is only slightly better than what i can get the davinci brand at sam 's club but the quality is far lower in my opinion for hazelnut fans i suggest avoiding this particular brand . 
i'm sorry i bought this brand it leaves a lousy after taste in your mouth no wonder amazon is giving 99cent shipping on this item stay away ! ! ! avoid ! ! ! ! . 
the flavor of big train hazelnut is not significant one has to add a lot to have a flavor impact of the three big train flavors i purchased \( including vanilla and irish creme \) , hazelnut is the least satisfactory \( vanilla 's a little better irish creme is best i gave that one 4 stars \) . 
when i first started to use iams savory sauce , my dogs loved it after a few weeks , they do n't seem to care too much for it anymore they still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while , and will eventually eat it when they are hungry , but they do n't consider it to be a treat anymore i still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced , and low calorie one big negative i have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it they are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around the mouth stains i used to buy all different flavors of iams savory sauce , buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining vitagravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins , so if your must have some sort of gravy , i recommend vitagravy a bit more or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog this creates a gravy like texture and aroma that most dogs love not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues , but a great free solution for picky eaters . 
very disappointed , not much pumpkin or spice , just pretty close to plain old coffee i was hoping for something like they have at tim horton 's but its not even close . 
the ones i received were mostly yellowish in color with some light green instead of dark green , dry and somewhat stale , they may have been in a warehouse longer that they should have ! . 
the pumpkin seeds i received from the bob 's red mill company were stale and contained a lot of small seed fragments . 
bobs red mill pumkin seeds came to me in a great box and inside the box well packaged and extremly secure shelled seeds br br i cannot say enough about the quality of the packaging a really nice thing for me because it takes some time for me to finish them all and they stay fresh and secure because of the special care taken in the packaging br br the quality of the seeds themselves is very good they are uniform in appearance well shaped appetizing and healty looking br br the price here is totally right for those of us that need more closer to a bulk level of foods these came in a multipack carton br br these are not only items by bob red mills there are many and if grains and nuts and seeds are in your diet your childrens diet or even your pets diet then i cannot recommend this line enough to you for fresh healthy eating ! br br try them ! . 
i ordered the 6 month ice cream of the month club for my wife 's birthday she received her first shipment today and none of the 4 ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams \( you could have bought several of the ice creams , such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip , in your local grocery store \) when i called the 800 number i was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it does n't meet their quality guidelines when i told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the overview sheet from amazingclubs , the customer service rep was rude and told me that i needed to call back and talk to someone in their support group \( note you must call before 6 00 pm est to speak to someone in this group \) i would seriously caution you to shell out more than 300 for this club . 
this is simply a mix of brown sugar and splenda , i am sure it would be cheaper to make your own . 
i made the mistake of thinking that this product was simply brown sugar flavored splenda i did n't read the product details stating that it actually has brown sugar in it my mistake . 
these are not black winter truffles \( tuber melanosporum \) i thought the price was too good to be true , \( even though they are n't fresh \) , and it is these are tuber indicums it says so right on the label br br i was very angry about this , but jr mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them so i give jr credit for excellent responsiveness and customer service , although i still feel they should not be labeled black winter truffles . 
i though this product lack flavor as i taste different brands far better br there were no real flavor as i expected sorry . 
had no taste and after the heat of the dish it was on turned them to a leathery tecture better off buying the high price truffles . 
we tried these and they were bland and had no redeeming qualities we sauteed them slightly and also tried them as is shaved the price as some have mentioned reflects what you get for truffles spend your money on white truffle oil you 'll be much happier , we are also wait for the white truffles to come in from italy , i would not knock jr as a company but would not recommend this offering . 
there was absolutly no scent or flavor to this when i brought home truffles from aosta in italy they were wonderful and cost less these were worthless . 
i ordered this in the past and was extremely disappointed they are unlike truffles that i know of they were hard like a huge seed , had no truffle aroma i threw all contents out will never order them again . 
this is not what one should expect from a black truffle , but we are not paying the price for a winter truffle it is cheap , but there is a reason for that there is no taste and no smell at all i was disappointed when i tried this truffle , but i realized that the price was that for a reason at least it can be used to add a colour to your dish . 
i should have listened to the negative reviews , but hoped that the positive reviews would ring more true there was veery little truffle flavor that got entirely lost in the risotto i made i agree with the other reviewers in that this was woody and flavorless not worth even this price for truffles . 
little lesson on truffles br truffles graded extra are larger than most , the second highest in truffle quality best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process , to release all their aroma and perfume chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas , risottos and omelets whole entire truffles are marked brushed \( which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt \) , preserved in brine or truffle juice which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths and are ready to use br br preserved truffles are a nice , budget friendly way to add visual truffle appeal to dishes however , if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish , chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections jarred or canned truffles , sold by vendors , are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not , by themselves , deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles they are great to use with truffle oil the oil will add the flavor , the preserved truffles the truffle look , but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish , or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget does n't allow for the real thing br note preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost no flavor or odor if you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle , then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle if you 're looking to add a truffle look only to your dish , then this is the product for you br br better to buy real truffle oil experiment , for example jr mushrooms specialties on amazon , is a good start about 10 dollars is low commitment that is in line with a superior bottle of extra virgin olive oil \( evoo \) . 
i was very excited about this purchase until i tried this truffle br these were horrible maybe i got the worst bottle they have ever sold and i just happened to get them but , these are bad if you want to eat the root of a dirty old root of a tree , you will enjoy these if you doubt my credibility of my review , please feel free to read my other reviews please do n't waste your money my wife tried these and could n't even believe these could be called truffles . 
zero stars for this item i could n't even confirm that the wrinkled little animal offal sort of thing is a truffle this lacks any aromatic attraction at all i 'd be afraid to put it in anything i planned to eat for fear it would ruin the entire item br br as for the famous jr service , my complaints about this product have been ignored . 
i am the biggest fan of mushrooms you 'll ever meet , but these are really disgusting they taste like dirt i have to imagine better quality truffles \( if these are even truffles at all \) are muuuuch better they 'd have to be there 'd be no comparison these are really bad . 
these truffles are not as great as they are made up to be i thought for the price they would have a greater taste , but they did n't have much taste at all they are not worth the price , but had to find out for myself i will not be buying truffles again , and i'm not going to spend over 10 for a fresh one . 
this is the worst flavored coffee i have ever tried there is no aroma or flavor of chocolate raspberry to this coffee bean at all in fact the coffee tastes sour i too am sorry i could n't buy just 1 lb to try it first now i am stuck with this awful coffee i cannot return so , buyer beware no returns ! . 
i like some of coffee bean direct coffees , but i cannot stand the taste of this one , and no one else in the house likes it either i wish i could of bought it in a smaller package , rather than the 5 lb bag that cost over 30 i do not recommend this product to anyone , but everybody has their own taste , and some people may like it . 
this is a pretty good cup of tea i just wish pg tips made pods for the keurig brewer maybe eventually ! . 
this is an awful coffee the flavor is extremely weak and tastes more like a lemon grass tea than coffee . 
love the taste of this product , really keeps you full with just a small amount first bought it at costco , they no longer sell this product the reason for the two stars , half the bag was crushed , could eat it with a spoon . 
check out the nutritional info , the sodium 5 , 510 grams ! 230 of your daily requirement i used this and our casserole was ruined because it was so salty ! ! ! ! ! ! and what 's up with that price \? my box cost a dollar unfortunately i bought two boxes , so i'm throwing the other box away no bargain here it is wildly un delicious and un healthy for you ! br \( yeah , i'm embarrassed that i did n't read the label first ! \) . 
the product was okay but the color was very different than advertised it was a darker pink , not red at all br br i tried to use it a couple different ways , and as a relative beginner , i did not find the product easy to use br br i tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to paint it on \( i had read this was the best way to do it \) i found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively in the end , because the red color was important for the cake , i mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color , not a great deal br br in the end , i would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red but as was , i did n't find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again i hope that other people have a better experience as i very much like the idea of the product . 
the product was fair , not as country as i would like , but better than you find in a grocery store . 
i have placed two orders for the weber grill grinder roasted garlic herb in the past i was so disappointing the last time i picked up my order as it was not what i had ordered it was citrus twist with garlic i just love the garlic and herb grinder and have given my first order away to my family as christmas gifts i now do n't even have one bottle for myself you can see i have reordered the garlic herb and hope i will receive what i have ordered it would be so inconvenient to repackage and return if it was possible to buy it in my location i would but it 's not available br br very disappointed br br leona br br the order that i received with the citus garlic was as follows br br transaction date 11 03 2011 br location br amount 20 94 br reference number br description amazon com amzn com billwa . 
second time i have reported this one jar broken and order br not what pictured jam same but jar different i know my ginger br br this not same . 
you can order the same products online from nespresso for approx 25 and you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items , some of which you may not like br br nespresso makes great coffee and great machines the nespresso capsule offers posted on amazon however are all by third parties who prey on people who do n't know better . 
tastes burnt , roasted , slightly rotten sunflower seed taste gritty , bland no salt , sugar only seeds would not eat if it was free . 
i almost never write reviews , but i thought i would for this one i'm pretty open to tastes of anything , but something about the smell and taste of this product was really bad it tasted off almost i'm really disappointed because i had hoped to like it and i love fruity green teas , but this was no good i 'd strongly recommend trying a sample of this \( if possible \) before buying sorry zhena 's maybe i 'll like another flavor i have n't given up on you yet . 
this tea has mostly all raspberry flavours with little to no peach at all i added a peach green tea bag when i brew it a little sweetener it 's very tough to taste the sparkling wine flavour , either at best , it 's a nice raspberry green tea , but it 's certainly not what i was expecting hoping for if i bought it from a store , i would have taken it back . 
the photo shows potato and carrot pieces in the butternut squash base but upon opening a can , there are no potato or carrot pieces to be found , unlike the cans i 've bought from a local grocery store i guess this must be a change in wolfgang puck 's recipe but the photo on the can does not represent the contents anymore several cans out of the twelve pack were delivered dented , although none seriously packing with better filling could have prevented dents in transit . 
i had ordered a case of this incredible soup , based on my experience of ordering it at the the dallas fort worth resturant it was so incredible that i ordered another container to go , couldnt stop thinking about it during my meeting in dallas and ordered two more before my flight back to california i went out of my way to go to this terminal so i could order it again br br so when i got the canned version not as impressed oh well . 
this soup is advertised as creamy , however when it arrived it was signature puck changed the recipe of the creamy butternut squash soup and is now calling it signature butternut squash soup it does not taste the same \( and is not as good \) as the original recipe . 
the soup is rich and tasty , but don't buy it from amazon the packaging is so poor that the cans arive dented as did the replacement shipment i got my money back but now have to pay more to buy this wonderful soup from my local grocer . 
this is twice as expensive as basic box mac and cheese it is just so so in taste if you check the ingredients it is not much different than other mac and cheese the cost does not justify the ordering i will not be ordering from amazon again the cost is much cheaper at a big box chain . 
it 's all natural , no artificial color , no weird ingredients but it also has no taste the sauce is thin and runny and does n't have much flavor if you need a boxed dinner in a pinch , then by all means use a product with natural ingredients but if you want good mac and cheese , stick with homemade . 
i have been disappointed with this product we have always enjoyed annie 's products have never had a problem , until now the cheese was so solidly clumped that i was unable to make a sauce without lumps i have used 3 different packages from my order have had the problem with all of them i am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse either way , beware . 
i love annie 's , but this had no taste , very bland and unappealing i would not purchase this again , but worst of all i'm stuck with 6 boxes boo ! . 
i bought a new bread machine and bought this collection of bread mixes as well as some single mixes to try it out the single mixes worked well as they included yeast packaged separately in the mix my machine states clearly not to get the yeast wet , to put it on top of the flour away from the water the mixes in this collection have the yeast in the flour , not packaged separately the bread failed to rise at all why would they package the yeast separately in the single mixes and not in the multi packs \? along with the heartland collection i also purchased the baker 's choice collection i am throwing them all out do n't waste your money . 
the bread has a good taste but does not rise properly and only makes 1 2 loaf i checked the temp of the water as suggested with bad results after raising the temp to 100 degrees i got it to rise to 3 4 loaf pretty expensive for the quality and i wo n't buy again . 
i bought this because the ingredients seem to be ok but for some reason it made my dogs have to go outside at least 3 times each night , overnight for the 2 weeks we gave this to them we changed back to origen , a food they do well on and the middle of the night bathroom trips stopped in 2 days also , my older dog tends to get really diggy when she is eating something not good for her and with this food she was constantly digging at the couch ! i have no idea what is wrong with this food , none of the ingredients stand out to me as being the cause but something in it really messed my puggies up ! . 
the problem with this peanut butter is the use of evaporated cane juice which is a coy way of saying raw sugar accent on the sugar the sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple it was n't very maple y it was gritty , sweet and pretty much not great maybe the cane juice crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter anyway , it was a loser br br i had heard much hype about this peanut butter , started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in new york i happen to like pbj and celery with pb a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes i gave it two stars if you are making a confection or cookies , it could be very good , but as eat alone peanut butter , i found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes . 
i just received the plant i paid extra for a quick delivery to secure the plant 's condition it arrived on time , however it arrived wrapped only in moist news paper , without any protection for the plant the plant is completely smashed this was , for me , a complete waste of my time and money i paid more for shipping than for the item itself and it did n't do a bit of good very disappointing . 
i ordered this item and was not pleased when it arrived , however the seller promptly contacted me to make things right they refunded my purchase in full after requesting a photo of the item their response was quick and much appreciated i will likely not purchase plants online any longer , however , if i do , i would not hesitate to consider this seller again mainly because of their customer service . 
this plant appears to be dead on arrival ive had in full sun since arrival and its leaves and stems are pink and not growing at all ide order another one but it will probably die in the slow shipping as well 20 00 for a dead weed no thanks they wouldnt let me submit this review with out clicking a star not even worth one star note the picture they used for this product has six more branches than mine i have three . 
ordered this plant to remedy a fruit fly invasion the amazon shipping was acceptable , but the manufacturer does not create the packaging to facilitate any shipment , unless they were to put this side up on the box the dirt was everywhere but where it was supposed to be and the plant \( audrey \) was upside down , roots up in the box if i had found one locally i would have bought it there hoping audrey survives , but i do n't have high hopes br edit audrey is now deceased do not recommend . 
plant was dead on arrival and was mangled in its container , probably better to buy one locally i dont think its gonna make it . 
the plant looked great the day it arrived with that said , the arrival took an extra week to get here after the first day one of the heads turned blacked and i had to remove it i give it 4 hours of direct sunlight a day and always keep the media wet i never use tap water only rain and purifies water i still have yet to see any of the heads open i'm very nervous that they will not ever open maybe they will send me another one . 
the plant was upside down in the box and i had to put the roots back inside the planter it never came out of shock and turned black and died . 
hi ordered the venus fly trap very quick service , nice vendor , but the plant died and turned black over the next 3 days after we got it . 
i had a second plant to replace the first one it to came in sad shape , br i should of went to a local nursery at least then i would of got a good plant br dont waste your time with this vender . 
the plant arrived dead it cost as much to ship i did not want to hassle with any kind of return i should know better than to buy a plant on line . 
i received an undersized , sickly plant that could not be nurtured back to health what was i thinking ordering a plant over the internet \? never again ! . 
it only lasted 2 days came mostly dead glad it was only 10 bucks it was also very small so the flies i wanted it to eat , it could n't . 
i ordered this plant for my seven year old daughter she was extremely excited to get it so i even ordered the express 1 day shipping , which i paid over ten dollars for , and it still took over a week to reach my house once it got to my house , i opened the box expecting it to be a fully established plant , which would look similar to the picture shown this is not the case it came as a pot , a bag of soil , and a damp paper towel with a very small plant inside maybe 1 inch long there were absolutely no care or planting instructions or anything like that at all we were pretty disappointed however , i was able to plant what was there in the dirt and it seems to have survived and looks a bit better now my daughter is happy with this plant now , but it was a rough start . 
its smaller than i expected i dont think 3 inches is as big as it used to be it comes in this clear goofy plastic box that told me to use said box as a humidity dome i do n't remember seeing a dome in the little shop movie but i tried it anyway a day later my plant was burned and never recovered br br i 'd give it more stars if the directions were more clear it was cool seeing the heads close up on things . 
the plant came very healthy but smaller then described it was described as a large venus fly trap i received a medium size venus fly trap but it was a healthy one even fed before it was shipped being that i paid a reasonable price for it 's unexpected size i do n't believe i loss on this one in fact i am pleased with the plant . 
i received the pant faster than expected , but it was brown and considerably smaller than advertised i have very little hope that this plant will live out this week , but if it does i will update this review with a higher rating . 
i ordered this plant as a gift for a friend and was not told until recently that the plant had died shortly after she received it she said she followed care instruction but the leaves started to fall off and it wilted and died i wish i had known sooner but she just told me last week . 
two of the three plants were dying and are now dead they all were tiny ! ! ! they are suppose to catch flies but not one fly has been caught because they could n't even fit in the bloom rip off ! ! ! do not do business with this vendor . 
i recieved the fly trap and it seemed fine i put it in a nice sunny area it did good but then 2 days later it just died so i paid 15 bux for a plant that lived 3 days lol . 
i received the plant in great condition but soon killed it the directions said not to fertalize it and exactly what to plant it in so , i bought exactly what it said but did not pay attention to the fact that the medium had rapid gro in it so it died within 3 days my seven year old loved it while he had it though he even named it , fed it and took care of it as if it were a life pet ! . 
on the label it says , 1 3 less sugar than regular peanut butter if you read the fine print , it is because it 1 3 less peanut butter ! that being said , it is very tasty . 
my golden retriever loves these bones ! i ordered them and they arrived in a timely manner however , when i opened the box , they were old meaning the filling was somewhat dried and did n't completely fill the hoof due to shrinkage once the plastic is removed , the filling pretty much falls out very disappointing ! . 
i grew up in nj and the local italian food store sold this sauce along with dough and cheese that you could take home to make your own pizza ! i loved it then , and i love it now the only issue is the price at almost 4 per can it would be hard to justify the cost so to be clear , 5 stars for the sauce , but 1 star for the price ! . 
i was given a track number and told it was delivered to my pobox it never happened i received a refund and am now in the process of wating for my new reorder . 
i really do not know what the issue is with this goat milk my one year old daughter has suffered horrible constipation since switching to cow milk on her birthday after a month of us both suffering \( because i had to help it along if you get my drift \) , i switched her to goat milk after 2 days , she was passing perfectly soft stools the goat milk definitely cured her of the constipation , but each can i open seems to be different sometimes when i reconsitute it , i know right away that it is going to taste terrible because the smell is so strong other cans , i hardly notice it she will not drink the bad smelling milk , and when i have tried it , i have nearly vomitted ! majorly salty and gamey tasting br compared to fresh \( meyenberg from the fridge section of grocery store \) , well , it really does n't compare i have found the fresh to taste sweet , like cream , and then there is a little gamey after taste , but nothing like the slap you in the face taste of the powdered i was hoping to save money with the powdered , but since it is a 50 50 chance she wo n't drink certain cans , i am really wasting money i am thinking i will have to stick with the fresh from now on br if anyone has any ideas about what the difference between cans could be , i would love to hear it ! i always have prepared it with britta filtered water \( warmed on the stove \) and mixed it up in pyrex , then stored it in a large ball jar in fridge \( i know i should prob call the company and talk to them , but that would require me to actually remember to do it at a time that they are open and i am able never happens ! ! \) thanks ! . 
i must be the odd man out here but this powdered goat milk is horrible ! my 18 month old son is allergic to dairy and soy , hence the reason for goat milk we were going on vacation for two weeks , and i was afraid there would not be any source of goat milk at that destination being he drinks almost a quart a day of regular liquid goat milk i purchase from trader joe 's , i figured i would go for the gusto and buy a two weeks supply for him it smelled horrible and more importantly tasted horrible ! words cannot even describe how disgusting this stuff was my poor son almost threw up from tasting it which prompted me to smell it it smelled so bad , i could n't even taste it myself maybe we 're just used to the regular brand he drinks \? my only advice , try a small amount first it is not returnable ! ! ! . 
i purchased this product in the hope of utilizing it to produce yogurt the yogurt produced by this product was very thin and could not be thickened using only culture br br from the producers website br br note goat milk yogurt is very thin , almost like kefir for a thicker consistency , add 1 packet of unflavored gelatin dissolved in some of the scalded goat milk br br the product has a distinct aroma not terrible , but was stronger than comparable fresh goat milk the flavor of the milk was only acceptable br br in a pinch this product will suffice , however i would not personally recommend it for regular consumption . 
i do n't know how people could say this does n't smell or taste bad it is horrible ! ! i was getting raw goat 's milk for quite a while and when we moved it was n't available the fresh raw milk was delicious and mild and did not have that gamey odor and flavor that this milk has maybe some people do n't mind the taste , maybe some acquire a taste for it , and maybe some even like it , but i think it is vile if you like the taste of the goat 's milk cheese in stores , then you may like this , if not , stay far , far away ! . 
the last shipment i received , when preparing the milk there were black specks or particles in it it was in two out of the three containers i do n't even know if it was in the first can i used this was the first time it 's happened and i 've been using goats milk for my daughter since december 2011 and she loves it plus it did n't constipated her like whole cow 's milk now i'm leary about buying another batch as it may contain this stuff again . 
it 's ok , but it is not as good as meyenberg 's fresh goatmilk in the carton it sort of has a waters down taste ! . 
too bad this stuff in general ranks high on the inflammation triggering foods i'm trying to follow a low inflammation diet i do love the taste of goats milk it 's very rich and creamy the liquid is better than the powder . 
others may have a different experience we were using this as a supplement to mother 's milk because mother 's milk just did not seem to provide enough fat protein for baby to gain weight problem , although stated that goat 's milk is easier to digest , we found that once we mixed the goat milk with mother 's milk , she ate more infrequently and got constipated with indegestion we had bought this to help with digestion , as formula is based on cow 's milk this goat 's milk seemed to have the opposite effect on our baby , and she did n't gain weight also , the taste is n't so great br br we can use it as back up , in case we do n't have milk in the fridge so , it 's ok , but i probably wo n't buy again . 
i do n't find the taste of this goat milk very pleasing if mixed to use in liquid form i 've had fresh goat milk and frankly , this does not come anywhere close even with reasonable expectations because of the powered form it does however have its use in my kitchen in baked goods where the flavor even if slightly sour can be of use certain bread , pancakes and the like do very well if i add this mix instead of other milks or water good to have in the pantry for those just in case days . 
arrived in good condition , looks like well made cans tastes nice , and i would love to use this product , but unfortunately , i got an allergic reaction from it . 
i 've been drinking using the fresh goat 's milk for years i 've recently bought the dry milk a href http www amazon com gp product b001e5dzts meyenberg powdered goat milk , vitamin d , 12 ounce cans \( pack of 3 \) a in hope of saving a little money it does taste a little powdery i ca n't drink it straight , where i used to with the fresh i noticed on the amazon page where it says customers who bought this also bought evaporated goat 's milk a href http www amazon com gp product b000ey5cog meyenberg evaporated goat milk , 12 ounce cans \( pack of 12 \) a i'm wondering if this makes it creamier or taste better i hope to get some feedback from those who have tried combining the two and what quantity of dry to what quantity of evaporated \? i'm trying not to give up on the dry yet br thank you , vicki . 
the can does not say no antibiotics i called the company and asked why the can does not say this first , she tells me that they have no antibiotics but the fda wo n't allow them to put it on their can i said lots of companies put no antibiotics on their label then she said we are making a new label i felt a definate flippant attitude i felt like she just wanted me to get off the phone br br well , i just canceled my autoship for their goat milk i am now looking for another goat milk that puts no antibiotics on their label i know that there are some good goat milk companies that do this . 
i love jell o no bake cheesecake but was disappointed the shelf life was so short i got it after christmas and the expiration date was april 8 , 2011 had i known that before i ordered i would have never ordered 12 boxes is a lot to use up in only 3 months i will not order again . 
136 for 12 boxes \? br br is this a rare item \? br br that 's 11 33 a box br br i think the item might be a bit overpriced . 
i'm rather conflicted about this product granted , it does taste like actual chrysanthemum tea \( like the ones you get at dim sum places \) when brewed hot , however it tastes bad when iced and mixed with sugar it does n't taste like chrysanthemum tea at all once it 's iced and combined with sugar the tea is enjoyable hot without sugar but it is way too light i need to double or triple the recommended amount of blossoms to get a decent amount of flavor and by then i'm pretty much done with the entire canister too pricey for me . 
my husband says these pretzels are great and he loves them however , on the box i saw a warning that says the pretzels are made in a facility that produces peanut butter therefore , i ca n't eat them so for those of you with peanut nut allergy i would urge caution . 
i ordered two 24 can packs of 11 5 oz v 8 juice , which were boxed together and filled with inflated plastic to buffer when i opened the box , although all the flip tabs appeared to be intact , one can had leaked some of it 's contents and the juice was all over the other cans and inside the box i weighed the cans to find out which one s had leaked and that 's how i determined which one to throw away \( the weight of the cans varied , but the variance was consistent , except one can was a few ounces short \) i am hoping it was just from the one can and i do n't turn up with salmonella down the road since this was a ups delivery , i am kind of surprised that amount of pressure was put on this package usually get superior service from them i have ordered like this in the past , and the product arrived in perfect condition , so as i said , i was disappointed this time . 
i bought this mainly because another review \( ca n't remember if it was on amazon or another site \) said it was better than morningstar farms crumbles and because it is gmo free now , i 've been a vegetarian since i was thirteen \( and that was decades ago \) , but i am the sort that does want fake meat resembling meat i 've little interest in a mushroom quinoa burger i want a meaty yet vegetarian burger with mushroom quinoa on the side also , i'm a professional chef , so i'm very picky about the foods i eat br br i'm saying this because i think it is important to know what the reviewer likes to eat when you base your purchase on a review br br tonight , i used the harmony valley hamburger mix in lasagna alla bolognese i also did the same recipe with the mf crumbles to compare two things i was curious about br br 1 \) flavor they 're kind of about the same , especially considering i was adding a browned mirepoix , marmite , and veg worcestershire i guess i should fry up a patty of just the hv mix , but i did eat a raw spoonful and it was okay , but blander than mf br br 2 \) texture mf wins it just does \( sorry , mf haters \) it has larger pieces with a more meat like texture plus , even after absorbing water in the fridge and then simmering on the stove , the hv was too wet br br now , the reviewer who also liked it better than mf also said something about it holding together on its own and that mf does n't well , that 's true this was thick and stuck to itself , much more like the texture of ground meat if you were to puree it i use mf often in meatballs , and it holds together when bound with eggs and cheese i guess that 's the difference i do n't just want to thaw or add water and poof have dinner i expect to cook with an ingredient , the same as i would with real beef br br so i was n't bowled over in those ways , but i liked it hv hamburger mix is good and i'm sure it will be useful , which is also a plus no worry about not having bought a bag of frozen crumbles , you 've got a half dozen packets at home i have a tiny little freezer for someone who cooks for a living , so it is always an issue for me to be able to keep ingredients at home and although i 've seen some reviews complaining about the 15 20 wait for the hv mix to absorb water in the fridge really \? those people ca n't wait half an hour for a burger \? if you want an instant veggie burger that can be microwaved in the time it takes you to grab the ketchup , buy a frozen burger i think this mix will be good in better handmade veggie burgers and i look forward to trying ! br br addendum br br after eating the lasagna made with the hv mix , both my husband and i experienced horrible stomach bloating and pain i'm apparently a glutton for punishment , though , because i decided to give it another try and made meatballs with it yesterday not only did they not turn out as good as my usual ones \( made with mf crumbles and lightlife sausage \) , they had a sort of rubbery texture that i really did not care for but , blander and texture i can overlook , except again , the product gave us both the same horrible stomach bloating pains and gas ugh ! . 
i tried many teas and thought would try this kind saw it on dr oz show did n't like its taste . 
i do not like sour taste and this has a sour kind of taste which i do n't like the smell is n't that great either . 
in an effort to reverse augmenting high blood pressure , a physician recommended i drink hibiscus herbal tea kudos to celebration herbals for delivering the tea one day after the order was placed i followed instructions on the box and used spring water which was steeped for approximately ten minutes although the primary reason for drinking the tea was medicinal , i also wanted a flavorable tea sadly the taste of the tea was unexceptional accordingly , the next box of hibiscus tea that i purchase will not be from celebration herbals . 
i got this in the mail nice packaging and all opened it up to see its single serving bags 3oz of hot water to a bag not gallon size \( so i decided to make some and it tasted like the little pink bubble gum double bubble i used to get as a kid yuck so not what i was expecting . 
tasteless , basically says it all i love tea drink it every day i found this undrinkable great packaging , but not a good tea for me . 
i like the taste , but the store does not always has this some how it tastes different from the one in the store , much weaker caffeine and aroma . 
i bought this tea cause i had consumed the one from the bottle and i like that one br however in tea bag is not just tasting totally and completely different , but additionally tastes really br horrible believe me , i even tried to give it to my co workers for free after they tried it and they did not accept it br in my opinion it tasted like serum s now i have 100 tea bags wasting space , probably soon they 'll go to the waste bascket br br it 's sad i thought it would taste like the bottle or at least close , but totally a disappointment . 
i did n't order because it does n't indicate anywhere what size the bottle is , i think that 's basic information , maybe you should include that in your description . 
wolfgang puck recently changed their chicken soup the old stuff is excellent the new stuff is watered down , not filling and does n't taste as good the image and description on this item stated that it was the old soup the soup i received is the new stuff being a food item , returns are not allowed i feel this was false advertizing and am extremely displeased . 
i was familiar with a few of wolfgang 's recipes before i tried any of his soups first i tried a different flavor a year ago , but ca n't remember anything except it being bland and slimy i decided to try it a 30 minutes ago because i was desperate for something healthy and convenient because i was a tad sick and could not make my own unprocessed meal with the ingredients i had home i bought it for about 3 and hoped i just had a bad can of soup the first time , but this was just awful no taste , slimy , and hardly any chicken \( probably 3 4 tiny pieces \) i can see why they added such little chicken it 's just tasteless and dry tasted nothing like chicken i 'll go try another can of soup that can make me feel a bit better this sure did n't do it i have never had soup that tasted bland even after adding salt and seasoning i see positive reviews that make me thing i had another bad can because i still ca n't believe it had absolutely no flavor . 
this soup has no flavor broth had a slimy consistency instead of a liquid y one i was so disappointed . 
as we all know any canned soup , organic or not , should be avoided or at least limited it does work for storm supplies due to its easy medium term storage and it being infrequently or never used it will end up in a hunting camp for a few days of quick meals toward the end of its shelf life everything tastes better in fresh air and this stuff is n't bad again , its use is very limited br br do n't like the bpa issue either i did speak to wolfgang puck about pba and their plans like most , they are treading water to see what the government \( friends of the fda \) does or does not do about it what 's a little more poison added to the current mix in processed foods br br ever notice that most of the wolfgang puck soup ingredients here on amazon end at contains 2 or less of the following \? br br as i indicated above , we did try this soup , and it tasted ok , nothing special try adding a little more sea salt it is better than the msg enhanced , preservative laden campbell 's brand crap , a brand we would not buy regardless of circumstance one never knows who actually made this soup br br we consider the organic versions the lesser of \( insert remaining cliche \) , and have a case in case . 
i can get this at my local grocery store for 2 69 per can \( 32 28 for 12 \) . 
this soup is just offensive why does it taste like cinnamon \? also , it 's twice the price of campbell 's and 1 4 the chicken sure , it says it 's organic i totally believe that , do n't you \? . 
in court , as i understand it , you 're not supposed to testify about anything where you do n't have direct experience you can discount this review if you want , since i have only second hand experience with this soup br br i gave a case of this soup to a young friend who is a college student \( i worry about her starving \) she never mentioned whether she liked the soup , so i asked she finally admitted that it was , to quote her , the worst thing i 've ever tasted apparently her boyfriend also tried it and thought it was bad as well while my friend is rather picky , her boyfriend has a much wider culinary range , so if they both disliked the soup , i'm inclinded to think it 's not very good . 
i found this exact same product , same size at our local grocery store \( qfc and safeway \) for 2 99 so , am not sure why this product is priced so much higher . 
5 00 over the local grocer 's regular price i expected a fair market price when i placed this order , but because i did n't research it i was extremely disappointed to find it so inflated live and learn , i hope i can save someone else the trouble of having to make a return . 
purchased two liters looking for an oil to put in salads , on bread , etc something with a strong flavor of olive oil this is not it this is good for cooking has little flavor . 
i purchased this food coloring hoping it would create black frosting i read several reviews on this and other websites which suggested i use chocolate icing \( as white icing black food coloring gray frosting \) but this product did not darken the chocolate at all i ended up using over half for one cake and still decided the color was n't right it was still obviously brown perhaps my expectations were too high . 
the tree is nice , but that is the only part besides the pot did not come with a matching drip tray , as promised instructions were lacking information and were merely a printed piece of paper . 
the product was fair , not as country as i would like , but better than you find in a grocery store . 
i bought this because i was craving dark chocolate , and thought mint sounded great at the time the chocolate is way too sweet dark chocolate is supposed to be a little bitter , not too much , but enough to give it some bite i guess ghirardelli decided to cancel that out by adding more sugar add to it the super sweet mint filling , and i could barely finish a square it was so sweet considering the expense , i expected a much better quality . 
i use this as a whey soy protein alternative i am allergic to soy and have sensitivity to whey and this product seems to be free of both i actually have n't used it as a shake , but i use it to make protein pancakes i find i have to add extra cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey and stevia to make it more sweet at first i came out with some really awful pancakes , but after i found the perfect ingredients to doctor it up , they all come out amazing ! ! ! so if your looking for an alternative to whey and soy , i definitely think this is a good choice ! . 
what 's in this stuff \? where 's the list of ingredients \? br br i do n't eat anything unless i know and approve of what 's in it br br for example , although this product 's description says it contains no sugar , it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners , which are also bad for you br br for one thing , aside from tasting awful , artificial sweeteners often cause horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea br br in addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its guises \( e g natural cane juice , fruit juices , raw sugar , organic sugar , etc \) , i also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind br br so , what 's in this stuff \? . 
i have tried many different protein powders over the years , and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone \( since everyone 's taste is different \) , i'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk i have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth br br i mix my protein shakes with a hand blender , so i rarely have any mixing problems and even this protein mixed well the fun really began when i tasted it it tastes sour and acrid at the same time , absolutely horrendous i could not finish the shake i had mixed up , and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before i could actually eat or drink anything else br br this is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste , in my opinion of all the types i have tried , which is many , this has taken seat as the new worst one br br fyi , i had ordered this with another brand because i am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity if anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation , pm me . 
i bought this product to try as a replacement for jay robb egg white protein shakes , which is what i prefer but doesn't fit my budget to expensive for every day use i was looking for an alternative and came across this since one of the reviews said that it was soy free i decided to try it i don't have any problem with the taste with all of my health problems over the years i have learned not to expect a lot in that department it just taste like watered down chocolate to me i drink it with water or sometimes with rice milk because i need the extra calories on days that i can't handle solid foods however , on receiving the product , it does contain soy how much i couldn't say as it wasn't listed on the ingredigent column i found it mentioned on the back of the label stating that it contained soy letichen \( think i spelled that right \) i have not been able to find out how much if someone could shed some light on that i would appreciate the info also , i noticed that it has gone up about 10 00 since i placed my order last month , so it may not be an issue anymore , because that puts it about even with what i was paying for the jay robb egg white shakes . 
although it is very high in protein , i thought the vanilla ice cream flavor was very bland i would not buy this again as it was not tasty enough . 
well i have tried many protein shakes and the taste is never been a problem for me but this was just horrible it 's good for you but i just could n't do it it might be a good protein shake but it 's extremely salty , i tried to drink it with other liquids to help the taste but every time it tasted worse and worse \( too bad because i was looking forwards to see some results ! ! . 
so after comparing this to jay robb , i can say that this protein is not as good the taste is n't as good , and it does n't mix that easy i do n't think it is horrible , just not that good br br one thing i like about the jay robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs i sent healty n' fit an email asking where they get their eggs from , but they did n't reply it is a little cheaper , but i found the jay robb at vitamin shoppe for 20 per 12ozs , which is n't bad i have to say that i do n't like the dudes picture on the bottle , but that 's my only complaint . 
the protein powder is ok , not to good as i expected if you pour hot milk over it will will form substance like egg white , which is very bad in taste , not at all drinkable . 
i used this product cod roe \( tarako spaghetti sauce \) to eat when i feel lazy at japan br that very cheap and just boil pasta and mix this pouch because br i ate that product once a week in japan br br after i moved here america year ago i really miss some asian food because little expensive but br when i see picture i remind how good and excited because i bought this from amazon br br but taste little different , i was disappointed , too strong smell like a ocean br i throw garbage because i did not remember product of japan america br br i never ever buy this in america . 
packaging on these leaves something to be desired last shipment i received had 2 out of 3 boxes with the corners crushed and when i opened the first one and removed the bag , there were a lot of broken biscotti i expect it will be the same for the other box that was damaged given that these are fairly fragile , they should be given better protection from being crushed by the shippers br br the biscotti themselves are tasty , if a bit small i wish they were full sized , 3 or 4 inches long instead of an inch and a half but as i live in a rural area where people think biscotti is a kind of biscuit , these are a good second choice . 
pan ducale almond biscotti were a disappointment to me , not because they were bad , but because they could not come close to the great lettieri prato belli cantuccini almond cookies at best they are low in calories also in almonds . 
i thought i 'd be writing a review raving about this product sadly , i'm not br i would never use it for home use it tasted muddy and bitter i followed the directions i even made sure the water was hot but not boiling i 'd probably take it backbacking , but that 's it it 's worth a try if you have n't tasted it yet read some of the other neutral reviews it might help with expectations . 
coffee is good but i do n't care for individual pacs would rather have coffee in bags like their other coffee is packed . 
this sounded so tasty from the reviews and the flavors were enticing so i ordered some we had some for breakfast today and then went to pack the other boxes in bags to go to the homeless shelter to us , it is dreadful it has the texture of paste and not even palatable for us am throwing out the box we opened and canceling my order on subscribe and save when you consider how easy it is to make real oatmeal , i'm sorry i was fooled by these flavors . 
caribbean joy coconut milk offers a tempting price , lower than its competitors there 's a good reason for its low price by all accounts it tastes like half the visible amount is coconut milk , the rest being water br neither good for pina coladas or cooking , this is a poor value and i ca n't recommend it to anyone . 
gold prince has made a terrible mistake there are two products coldaid and fluaid they are different formulary unfortunately they display fluaid picture on the amazon website and their own website but the words are coldaid there is a separate product for coldaid regardless if you order the fluaid on amazon you will get the coldaid the picture is not the product the words under the drop down menu are worthless as they all default to the same product coldaid if you want fluaid , which is the superior product , do n't buy it from amazon or off of the sellers website it is a mistake http www amazon com gp product b002p936uk ref cm cr rev prod title . 
i found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting i would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea i'm not a pu erh expert and i am looking for something as authentic as i can get without paying an arm and a leg can anyone suggest a good quality \? \? the only reason i gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3 . 
i used quotes around the word tea because i doubt that the bags contain tea i would n't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea i would not give this product a single star it deserves zero stars in my opinion br this tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star . 
these guys are quite high on the nutritional scale but on these marinated morsels varieties , well , they hate them they get stuck in my cats' teeth and although it can be quite comical watching them afterwards , it just ins't worth them only eating about half a can and tossing the rest down the garbage disposal i recommend them for the nutritional value and please try them if you cat loves chicken my rescue loves many of the other varieties and this stuff has improved her quality of life tremendously recommend ! . 
my 9 1 2 month old would mush this around in her mouth and not swallow it there isnt much she doesnt like but she sure doesnt like this stuff it looks like a weird mushy green stuff i am sure it is super healthy but she didnt like it at all . 
the grains make this food really flakey it just does n't stick together and was falling off the spoon a major mess really it also does n't have a zip lock top and i thought it did like many of the other pouch foods and took this with us out to dinner i ended up putting the leftovers in a plastic baggie my baby also was not a fan of this at all and she is not a picky eater even my dogs turned their nose up at it and i thought it tasted pretty nasty . 
sent this to my mother to help her out with groceries since she is on a fixed income she said it was horrible and would be throwing the other 2 boxes out so i would not reccomend this product . 
i have 4 cats , and none of them really like these treats they will eat them eventually , but the certainly do n't go wild for them i do like that grain and chicken free , so they are good for cats with allergies . 
i really wanted my 2 yr old cat to like these treats because i already feed her wellness wet food , which is excellent by itself perhaps she 's too used to the whiskas temptations that i normally give her , but she did not like the jerky bits at all i did notice it was hard for her to pick up because they 're pretty flat , and the texture is chewier than what she 's used to the 3rd time i gave her the treats , she vomited it out looks like it 's back to the less healthy alternative . 
i bought these for my cat and if i give them to him , he 'll eat them , but it 's not the type of treat he 'll do tricks for or run over to eat it 's a healthier alternative to other treats , but i would n't buy them again because my main point of buying treats is to train my cat to do tricks or reward him for good behavior these treats simply do n't entice him enough to really be a treat . 
this product is really a hit or miss my cat does not seem to go crazy over these treats sometimes he does not eat these right away . 
i liked that these treats did n't have anything gross in them \( i e , corn , wheat , soy , by products \) my cats do n't really care for salmon , but i thought since it was mixed with turkey , which they love , they might like them well they did n't , they took one sniff and wanted nothing to do with them though my inside cats did n't want them , the stray cats outside loved them . 
i had pretty high hopes for the busy bone i have a large , active chewer \( the kind of dog that has to have several bones to choose from all the time if you do n't want her to chew up your bed frame \) i was hoping that with the busy bone 's 'long lasting' promise , i might be able to just give her one of these and at least have time to wash the dishes why do n't i describe what happened next br i was in the kitchen washing the dishes it had been about fifteen minutes since i 'd given the dog the bone deeply absorbed in annoyance with myself for not rinsing said dishes , i was scrubbing vigorously when an awful sound met my ears a terrible and hauntingly familiar crunching noise the dog was eating my bed so i go into the bedroom to scold her and even before i get a chance to look at the bed frame , i am struck by the mess she has caused the busy bone somehow leaves little brown crumbles all over the floor too small and numerous to pick up by hand and too gushy for the vacuum cleaner to clean up , the oobleck has to be washed out of the carpet with a dish rag and did i mention that they 're expensive \? br i will continue to stick with real bones that i purchase from the butcher they 're cheaper , they last longer , and they do n't leave a terrible mess . 
my dog demolished her busy bone in under 5 minutes i think she basically ate it , which was a huge disappointment we were hoping for something that we could give her that she would enjoy , but also something that would last a bit longer in addition to being more of a treat than a chew , these things are messy she had it all over the floor around her , and all over her paws it makes a sticky goop that is n't very easy to clean up i definitely wo n't buy these again , it 's too expensive to only last 5 minutes . 
i write this letter after considerable thought and anguish on friday morning , february 25 , 2011 , i was awakened by the screams of my fianc eacute e lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling greta , our 2 year old registered female pug greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a purina busy bone br br i'm left wondering how purina , a company with a name as iconic as betty crocker , bayer , gerber and general mills , could have not only manufactured such a lethal product , but , as i 've since discovered on the internet , has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves i find this absolutely appalling i'm 57 years old and i 've put my trust in purina products since i was a child and now our beloved greta , purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008 , is dead because of your product and lori , my sweetheart of 32 years , a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe a great animal lover , has had her heart torn asunder she 's simply devastated and angry and so am i br did you know that in the united states its citizens spend more on their pets than their children \? are you familiar with the westminster kennel club dog show series which includes the world 's finest breeds in competition for best in show , including the chinese pug \? do you have any idea of the loss we 've suffered at your negligent hands \? br i could talk about the money we paid for greta from the breeder , and having her spayed \( we do n't breed our beloved pets we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can \) and there are the regular check ups , and shots and so on i find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the kroger store from which we purchased your killing busy bone br i have a 91 year old father who lives alone i visit him at least twice a week , sometimes more if time allows he certainly appreciates those visits but he also has a fulltime companion spencer , his jack russell terrier spencer will turn 12 in may dad is disabled , uses a walker , is scheduled for heart valve replacement surgery at the cleveland clinic , and has a myriad of other health issues yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog and i believe if it were n't for the loving attention spencer gives dad , he would not be alive today his dog has given him something special the gift of life something which purina has stolen away from us you 'd think that purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year old man but tragically that 's not the case br yet there 's more we also have a male pug which we named winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of winston churchill winston , like greta was , is truly an individual a soulful companion and like us , he 's now subdued he 's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he does n't understand why this concerns me br i am a professional photographer and writer by trade i work with the general public and i have to present a side to it which instills confidence writing , by nature , requires a certain state of mind as well as a result of losing greta , all i can think about now is me handing her a busy bone , not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later the guilt is killing me how can i write \? how can i do anything \? grief passes they say but tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime and what makes things worse in this case is that greta 's death could have been prevented br though both winston and greta liked the busy bone , several times in the past greta had gagged on it so , i served her a smaller portion each time , which , after careful observation i assumed resolved the problem in retrospect i should have responded more to the concerns lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with in a brief moment , while we were in another room , greta died because of your product and why should such a product even exist \? why was n't it at least labeled as a choking hazard \? why did n't purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores \? br the answer is self evident gross negligence a negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved greta and other dogs , but has now indelibly left its mark in lori 's and my life we 'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor i lie awake at night thinking about it now , as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even i , a writer , cannot express in words it 's now the closest we can get to our special friend we are utterly distraught greta , only 2 years old , healthy and in her prime , a wonderful , loving companion , is gone forever it 's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced thanks to purina br the very least purina can do is pull all forms of the busy bone from the market immediately , and to conduct adequate , responsible research in the future before releasing any purina product br br karl and lori br former owners of beloved greta , purebred female pug our baby gone forever . 
we have ordered elecare from this shipper twice the first time , we received it next day and were very happy the second time , it arrived next day as well , but two of the cans had opened and the box got wet , causing the inside of the box to be covered in clumps of spoiled formula when we used one of the unopened cans \( we had to since we had nothing else to feed the baby and this product is not sold in stores \) the baby became sick for several days . 
overpriced beans , they are packed in a glass tube that is not air tight br br the beans were thin and almost dry br br get the cheaper options at amazon instead , they are much better and way cheaper . 
i had used this frequently on and off over the years and did n't realize that it is not sold in the us any longer in the past the instructions were in english on the packet but i do n't recall what they were now it is entirely in german and no one i know speaks a word of the language i do n't have a scanner so one of the solutions suggested wo n't work do n't buy before realizing that if you do n't speak german and have no one to translate you are in a pickle i have 10 packs now ! another thing , all 10 packs expire in 6 months time , so do n't buy in bulk unless you plan to eat a lot of sauerbraten rated 1 only because i am unable to use the product and the product description does not mention either the language issue or the near term expiration date . 
i would we willing to try this product , and have six envelopes in my cupboard , but unfortunately the instructions are in german maybe i can hire an interpreter \? \? . 
as a fan of english irish breakfast teas , i found this tea to be very weak flavored if you like milder weaker teas , this may be for you but if you like more robust flavors , steer clear of this one . 
arm hammer 's baking soda is aluminum free , they just do n't write it on their packaging br br i was n't sure so i called them and they said there is no aluminum in it , and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product internally this leads me to believe that there just is n't aluminum in baking soda and researching it showed me that there might have been in the past , but not anymore and not for a long time br br i resent that bob 's red mill writes aluminum free on their package and then charges a premium for their product it 's also arsenic free , i hope if they label it arsenic free will we assume other brands are n't \? i do n't like that kind of marketing . 
all baking soda is aluminum free this is an unnecessary marketing ploy to get you to buy their product buy this because it is naturally mined and is cruelty free but do not be duped into thinking that good ole 59 arm hammer has aluminum in it btw the chemical process used to make a h is almost exactly what occurs in nature just faster but not cheaper it costs no more to mine sodium bicarbonate than it does to manufacture so yes you are paying for a name . 
i just called bob 's red mill customer service \( just do a g search for the company , their customer service number is under contact us on their site \) , and i was annoyed to learn that none of bob's red mill baking soda contains aluminum i 've been paying 10 15 \( with shipping \) for this magical 'aluminum free' baking soda only to learn that the bob 's red mill 'premium baking soda' at my local grocery is the same exact thing call for yourself if you do n't believe me ugh . 
this is a wonderful product but it comes in a paper bag which is easy to puncture and when you ship it in a box with no bubble wrap it slides around a lot and you start to get leakage of the product powder everywhere i would order it again if i was sure it would be packaged right so it would n't be sliding around in the box . 
great product and nice taste , glad they sell it online , not sure where to buy it in the local supermarket , it was a decent price , 2 11 , i just thought that the shipping fee of 4 99 seemed high , but the product seems great ! . 
i was very unhappy when this package arrived at my workplace the bags were not wrapped for shiping and was damage in route when i opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place i could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so i threw it away i made a mess all over the place what a waste i will not be ordering from this company again . 
purchased three pounds arrived well packaged am trying to find a replacement roaster of this blend this is good , but not great we 'll keep on looking . 
what constitutes a good coffee is rather subjective you can read countless reviews about it , but you do n't know until you 've tried it for yourself having enjoyed peaberry coffee \( i think the spherical shape results in better roasting \) from many different parts of the world , i gave this a shot based on the positive reviews posted and the great price boy , was i disappointed ! the beans are light medium in roast , has a mild subdued smell the beans looked dry , but this is not uncommon for light roasts i made a fine grind of the beans , and brewed it in a press sad to say , it was the most disappointing cup of coffee i have had in a long time the flavor was stale , without any fruity characteristic of peaberries , and reminded me of a cheap cup of joe from a dirty diner the worst part is i am stuck with 3 lbs of terrible coffee that cannot be returned \( amazon does not accept return of food items \) . 
my reason for the low rating is that there was no use by date on the bag , making it difficult to know if the beans were old and not well cared for or if that 's just the way tanzanian peaberry beans roast up not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products , but this supplier has found some way to get around it the coffee does taste good , although a hint of staleness exists , but the beans are totally dry no oil , no moisture is present when they are ground i 've enjoyed peaberry coffees from hawaii for years , peaberries are the best of the best beans i 've also come to enjoy african coffees for their full yet mild taste so , to find peaberry coffee from tanzania at such a great price was too much to pass up i expect to finish up the coffee i 've purchased , but probably would n't buy it again or buy any coffee from this supplier since i have no assurance of its freshness . 
i rarely post a product review , but i feel that i would be irresponsible as a consumer if i did not comment on the tanzania peaberry whole coffee beans i had high hopes when purchasing this coffee and i did my best to tolerate them to illustrate , i have consumed almost one whole bag of the three , but will have to dump the other two in the trash ! the beans are stale , dry , over roasted , with little flavor even loading up the coffee with sugar does not seem to help ! i resolved that this morning would be my last cup ! i will have to resort to buying the eight o'clock brand at my local grocery store i even briefly considered giving the two unopened bags to a friend , but decided that it was n't worth alienating him ! coffee bean direct , you need to do better , much better . 
the coffee was not stale as some have had , but the roast is too dark for a bean such as this i believe a better product could be had with the same beans . 
we had found some other peaberry coffee previously which had a really interesting , rich flavor to us for some reason , this brand just tasted flat to us by comparison the search for the perfect peaberry coffee continues . 
i tried this pricey dog food for my australian shepherd on the advice of a friend who has a small dog does that does very well on one of their foods geared for toy dogs first of all , making a decision on what food to buy is confusing they have many breed specific foods and to look at all the bags is exhausting with the help of a sales clerk i picked the medium breed adult my dog , at first did like the food very much but i felt he was overwhelmed by the amount of food i had to feed to maintain his caloric need and gradually he lost interest in eating it the ingredients list was pretty standard but did have nice levels of antioxidants and omega oils certainly this was not worth the price tag . 
bought this product to give to a family member who lives cross country and is going thru treatment for cancer lemongrass tea is supposed to help with side effects of radiation and chemotherapy i tried it as well have had other products containing lemongrass tea that tasted better still , good value for the price and could probably be mixed with other teas to improve taste . 
regular reduced fat milk from horizon received slightly over a month away from the expiration date my intention was to buy whole milk but the product description is confusing i sent an email to the customer support no response , after 3 weeks i checked and found that they made the picture larger \( good \) but left the product description without change br as for me , it is crazy expensive shipping while i can get same fat free or reduced fat milk at stopnshop or market basket the difficult thing is to find whole milk funny that whole milk as natural product became unpopular i guess too many people are concerned about becoming overweight \) . 
it 's the standard horizon milk , in small packages that you do n't have to refrigerate br br the only reason i buy this is i bake , and i hate being halfway through a recipe and discovering i'm out of milk with these packages , i throw it in the back of the cupboard , and it 's there when i need it obviously , i use fresh when i have it ! br br i suppose the main market for this is kid 's lunches , where you do n't want to worry about spoilage it would be fine for that , although it 's about the most expensive way to buy milk \( and the price of for this today is twice what i paid , and is currently twice that from other sellers on amazon , so check around ! \) br br they also show reduced fat milk , but shipped me the low fat . 
once again i find myself trying to like tazo herbal teas , but they keep putting licorice in teas where is just does n't seem to belong , to me anyway this is another example where i expected a lovely flavored tea and the licorice flavor is so strong , it 's just about all i can taste i guess i 'll just give up on tazo who ever blends all their teas has radically different taste buds than mine ! . 
this tea was not what i expected i love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product the tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which i enjoy this tea has a stronger rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor furthermore , i found that the product description does not give a full list of the tea 's ingredients br br the ingredients listed on the box include cinnamon , licorice root , orange peel , indian sarsaparilla , chicory root , rooibos , natural flavors , star anise , almond extract and locorice extract . 
wow , very weird taste i typically like all the ingredients , but this mix just tastes wrong it 's somewhat similar to sarsaparilla tea , but with a licorice aftertaste it is n't so bad that i could n't finish the first cup , but not my cup of tea . 
well i bought this item before and enjoyed it immensely pink salmon is very good for you br br this time i ordered again , received albacore tuna instead of pink salmon amazon does not do returns on groceries such as these , even if not opened that i can see i sent personally an email to raincoast trading company based in canada , also left a phone message as well delayed response , but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item gone through hoops in the help center of amazon to no avail until i found the toll free amazon phone number , amazon llc confirmed they can not accept the return , but will send the correct item promptly we shall see , awaiting a replacement item br a minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon i am used to ordering br anyone want some tuna \? o well br br p s updated review sept 30th 2009 , i finally got the ordered item , partly because the amazon rep corrected it when i called in and sent it fast ! btw , it cost me a toll call to canada to the company without a prompt reply that just added insult to injury well i was able to order from a different merchant through amazon thank you amazon for coming through \) . 
i purchased this product to lure black bear to the bait pile the product has no sweet smell as one would expect i have asked for a refund or exchange from the supplier , no response . 
when i read the description of this it said mini these are regular size tastes great but my 86 year old mom wants the mini ones and i have not been able to find the smaller dine size ones . 
i got sent the wrong item , which happens i know i tried to contact the company multiple times with no response i finally had to contact amazon and they are returning the item for me . 
my cat has an iron stomach she can eat absolutely anything and everything and is always getting into my human food and has never thrown up i gave her 2 of these treats and within 20 minutes , she was wheezing and throwing up all over my carpet i did n't connect it at first but when i gave her the same treats the next day , exact same reaction ! br br i have tried several different flavors of this same brand and she has had the same reaction ! if you are trying these with your cat for the 1st time , only give them 1 of them and just wait to see how they react before you give them anymore . 
both of my cats \( age 11 \) threw up for an extended period after eating just 3 of these into the trash they go \( not the cats , the treats \) not sure what they were reacting to but thought it would be good to let other cat parents know the risk . 
my sweet little persian looks like she is dying she 's been puking all night because of these treats how has this item not been recalled \? . 
i have two cats my big boy has eaten these and never had a problem as a matter of fact he has never vomited or had a hair ball since i adopted him at 2 months my girl cat throws up every time she eats this particular flavor since i treat them equally these are no longer purchased i hate to see my girl sick so i just recommend you watch your cats after you give them these treats if not a problem carry on . 
i 've tried it with both my cats , several times every time they eat this , and other whiskas temptations products , they vomit within minutes br they love it , they want it , it 's cheap but it makes them puke , so , i 'd consider this a bad purchase . 
both of my cats vomit from all temptations treats , but especially the hairball variety one of my cats actually is getting hairballs from these treats when he did n't before i 've tried all of them , and minutes after they eat their treats they vomit this does n't happen with any other treats like whisker lickins or pounce . 
i do n't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product , it 's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others do n't make a mistake br br when i got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats i started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it then i noticed he would vomit occasionally it was only after closer inspection did i realize these treats are for cats 6 months and older i'm sure there 's a reason for this , they caused his vomiting i switched to a different temptations medley and he has n't vomited since so keep in mind , there is a reason they limit these to older cats , they really are n't kitten safe i only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him i can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package . 
i finally did the research on this temptation treats and i'm glad to see that my suspicions are correct i have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the cause of him vomiting ironically , i even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting now is official , i stopped giving them to him as often , and then monitored him whenever i gave him any it soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever i give him this treats sometimes he would vomit within minutes , and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning , but if i give him this treats , i'm sure to be cleaning up orangee throw up off my carpet soon after i think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients , and they probably do n't do anything to other cats but i'm never buying this again for my kitty . 
you know , i was searching the internet for the words temptations and vomit when i came across these reviews i was surprised to hear that i'm not the only one who has had problems with this product within an hour of eating these treats my cat vomits for about 40 minutes i did n't realize it was the cause until the second time i fed them to her it 's really bad because it does n't cause the cat to throw up all at once it 's like she can just vomit a little at a time and you 're forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit \( \( or locking her in the bathroom \( which is horrible \) \) . 
like many others on here , my cat was vomiting within minutes of eating these tasty treats she really loves them , however they do n't love her back it took me about a week to put this product and my sick kitty together finally after a google search , i came across these reviews i stopped giving her the treats and so far , my cat has been vomit free buyer beware , this might not happen with every cat , so it may be wise to start slow with this product to see how your pet will react and build up slowly back to her greenies i go ! ! . 
i have fed my 2 cats these treats the last 2 days within 5 minutes of eating them , they are both throwing up i will be going back to the three dog bakery treats expensive but have never made my cats sick why is the company not responding to so many bad reviews \? . 
my one year old cat ate a few of these and seemed lethargic two weeks later i gave him a large helping of these br and i thought he was going to die he laid around and would not eat or move for two days i will not feed him these br again same thing happened to my parent 's cat after eating the salmon variety . 
my sister gave her cats these and loved them , so i got them for my cats our 4 cats have been vomiting a lot lately , and we traced it back to these treats google whiskas temptations recall they were recalled not too long ago and i do n't know why they are still on shelves do n't buy these they will make your cat sick and who know what else it 's doing to their internal system please keep your cats away from this product ! . 
i 've never written an amazon review before , but this product was so horrible i had to warn would be buyers i can eat pretty much anything , but i had to empty out both bottles it just tasted like colored sugar water \( very thin \) , sickening sweet do n't know if there was any onion flavoring the only reason i bought this is because i could n't get ken 's steakhouse vidalia onion dressing shipped in california so far , the worst product i have purchased on amazon buyer beware , unless you like sugar water , then drink up blech . 
i love these crackers but not the price change br br at 29 00 for 12 boxes 2 42 a box if you sign up for subscribe and save i was ecstatic i most definitely signed up for subscribe and save delivery br br not yet 2 months later i learn the identical item now cost 55 00 for 12 boxes br br bait and switch \? br br i think these crackers taste better than their clone parent the triscuit 12 boxes is just right for a two month period i keep a couple boxes at work use them for bringing nibblies to gatherings and more importantly as a stable of my diet because i choose not to eat bread and i love food items with ingredient lists like this whole wheat , expeller pressed oleic safflower oil , sea salt , natural tocopherols added to preserve freshness br br as a big city dweller who uses public trans \( i do n't own a car \) i rely on amazon for certain essential groceries i pick them up at the ups store on my walk home from the train stop it 's one of the main reasons i'm a prime member br br i 'll need to cancel my subscribe and save for this item i like to think amazon was n't going to send the next delivery without notifying me of the new price br br i can get triscuits anywhere for 4 50 a box , sometimes less the back to nature cracker is now 4 59 a box br br it 's likely the pricing situation is out of their hands but i'm so disappointed ! br br looks like i 'll be checking out the cracker selection at costco . 
does anyone realize tocopherol usually comes from soy \? i'm still hunting for a cracker i do n't have to make their website is unclear about it 's source . 
i was very excited to get this then i had a cup , i never made it thru the cup br it is so sweet it is sickening really , now i have to find family to pawn this stuff onto br and christmas is a long way off lol . 
the o ring for the top does not seal properly with the pitcher and you have to tilt the pitcher more than other pitchers to get adequate flow this makes the top fall off and the potential for all the contents to spill out i just lift the top up a little when i poor to bypass this problem the glass is sturdy and the apparatus that holds it is sturdy i got some stuff in between the metal ring and glass , which looked terrible , but is easily disassembled to clean there is no stop for the screw so over tightening during reassembly could break the glass . 
i really wanted this food to work , as it seems to have good ingredients for a decent price however , my cats , who are typically ravenous little mongrels , do n't even bother to check it out when offered so much for saving a couple of bucks now they eat organix . 
used for less then 2 months both cats fur began falling out bad br stopped using it the cats fur is back to fine br back to feeding my cats nature 's variety instinct br i baught this petgaurd product at fairway market not amazon br will not use it again . 
i felt really good about being a good cat mommy and buying something of such quality for my sweeties too bad none of the would eat it , no matter what i did br br donated it to the local spca maybe a dog will eat it . 
i used to order this product at 25 per box of 12 cans and now it turned into 50 dollars \? \? \? how did it double out of nowhere \? \? . 
this is the most useful info you will ever need to know about k cups , and one that took me forever to discover br br bold extra bold coffee in terms of k cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger , it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee br br there ! now you know br br my mom goes for the extra bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now , and she 's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck \( or rather mine , since i buy it for her \) br br unfortunately , out of all the extra bold k cups she 's tried , she claims that the wolfgang puck is the weakest tasting she 's tried it in both the medium small serving sizes format , and both have produced less than full flavor drinks br br if you are looking for a rich , flavorful , strong tasting coffee , try the a href http www amazon com gp product b001hkzz7a van houtte cafe honduras medium roast , extra bold coffee , 24 count k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 2 \) a . 
this coffee brews very weak like a light roast w p chef 's reserve pods are just over half full put pod on scale and it 's 15 less coffee wgt than normal pods stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee . 
i wanted to like this coffee , i did we 've tried other wolfgang puck k cups and have been pleasantly surprised this just did not impress us bitter aftertaste , and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor smells great while brewing , but just does not live up to it in the cup i'm really disappointed because i now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink ! great price though . 
this is a good decaf coffee , but i 've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup it 's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess . 
warning this is a strong flavor br br i thought that this would be blue mountain y oh no it is like rum flavored or something yuk . 
with so many choices now , i thought i woudl give this a try br the donut shop decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short . 
i bought this because amazon had drastically increased the price on what i usually buy , so i thought i 'd try something new i normally drink coffee people donut shop , which is a nice , strong cup of coffee this was a little disappointing it 's called a medium roast , but when i brew a large cup \( my keurig has 3 size options \) , it looks like strong tea very light in color it makes a very weak cup of coffee when i brew the smallest cup possible , it 's a tiny bit better , but i prefer a large cup of strong coffee think i may try the rodeo drive or sorrento , but this one is just too weak and light for me \( oddly enough , the first time i tried donut shop , i thought it was too strong as i had been used to weaker coffees now that i 've started drinking the stronger varieties , it 's hard to go back to brown water \) . 
very good tasteing product but i need to use it the smallist setting on my b 60 to really enjoy the depth . 
as a french roast fan , i bought this brand of k cup with high expectations , considering the name attached to it i was disappointed it has a hearty aroma and full bodied flavor but leaves a bitter aftertaste br br if you 're a lover of the more robust roasts , i would recommend trying the a href http www amazon com gp product b002l41y8a coffee people kona blend island style , extra bold k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 50 \) a instead it is a smooth blend with none of the bitterness that delivers that kick you 're likely looking for . 
this flavored k cup is n't out of this world , but is n't horrible in my opinion , it 's way more flavorful than the wolfgang puck hazelnut k cup we love flavored coffee in our house , and so i would go with this one again worth a try . 
nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored i'm still not sure what flavor it is some type of nut i wrongly assumed that jamaican coffee would be similar to the blue mountain coffee which jamaica is known for ! how silly of me to assume that ! i hate flavored coffees so i was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee it only says flavored very small on the box so i did n't notice it before i opened it hopefully i can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee flavored coffee for myself ! . 
no where in the description does it mention that this is a flavored coffee by the name i thought it was a jamaican blue mountain blend but its flavored with a weak tasting hazelnut not very good . 
i was in a hurry and did not read the reviews i trusted amazon 's description and it did not indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was not jamaican it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad i feel cheated . 
i thought this was a jamaican blend or roast , but turns out it 's simply a heavily flavored coffee the flavor tastes artificial like fake maple syrup flavoring we have three coffee drinkers in our house and none of us could get past the first few sips now i have to find a home for the rest of it so it does n't go to waste . 
i wish amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee this stuff tastes the way i imagine newman 's own extra bold coffee would taste with curdled , spoiled bailey 's irish cream dumped in it nasty shudder ! ! ! . 
i drink about 4 to 6 cups of coffee every morning i'm always looking for a new flavor so i gave it a try i drank it but i would not order again steve . 
i like strong , but smooth coffee this coffee is strong enough , but a little on the bitter side for my taste i have tasted other strong blends that i like much more my husband , who likes a medium roast coffee , is ok with this coffee , but it not his favorite either i would only recommend it to someone who likes a little tang in their morning cup of joe . 
first of all , i have owned a keurig for about 4 years now , and i 've tried lot 's of coffee during that time , i have had an occasion k cup that did n't function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds br br i probably should have returned these before i bothered to open the second box since i drink my coffee from a thermal cup , i can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks br br i have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee its a bit like russian roulette , and i 've started straining it after i brew it br br i know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the green mountain , timothy 's or tully 's that i also use the good cups are a bit weak for my taste , but the flavor is ok definitely prefer not to waste 's on a product with a manufacturing defect . 
i'm not a gourmet coffee critic , but this stuff is disappointing based upon previous good reviews , i suspect that the coffee in the k cups i received is not the same they may have changed the manufacturing the wolfgang puck decaf i received is lifeless , watery , and tasteless there 's no aroma when it 's brewing in the keurig never again . 
coffee tastes great , but the cups get torn apart when brewing what a mess that is ! ! i am quite disappointed because i do like this flavor of coffee ! ! . 
perhaps my expectations were too high when i see the name wolfgang puck , i expect to be impressed this \( to my taste \) is very average tasting coffee to be fair , it is billed as a medium roast , and that 's what it is however , it 's just too bland for my taste br br if you want decaf with more character , try green mountain coffee 's dark magic decaf a href http www amazon com gp product b006n3i2sk green mountain coffee decaf dark magic , k cup portion pack for keurig brewers 24 count a , or emeril 's jazzed up decaf a href http www amazon com gp product b004616b3y emeril 's jazzed up decaf 48 k cups a they are darker roasts though , so if you want a milder coffee the wolfgang puck might be what you are looking for . 
i tried this product solely for the fact it has wolfgang 's name on it i should have stuck with timothy 's brand this was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee , more like a dinner coffee i will not be buying this again , also way too expensive compared to the others . 
it sure would be nice if they stated anywhere in the description of this coffee that it is flavored i love the bed and breakfast coffee , it 's just plain coffee , so i was surprised when i received the jamaica coffee and it was flavored yuck ! . 
i ordered 3 boxes of 18 each and opened one box to find they were pods and not br for keurig , and i ca n't return them ! ! ! \? \? \? \? \? yes , the pods fit into the keurig but br the end product is weak and awful i am most disappointed . 
the coffee is good however , at least half of these have n't been sealed correctly when i brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere not fun to clean it may have just been the batch we got , but i wo n't be ordering these again . 
well the creme caramel was on sale so i decided to give it a shot plus the fact that each k cup is individually prepared by mr puck himself anyway i quite enjoy these i never buy flavored ones so overall i'm happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as i usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild . 
honestly the first time i tried jamaica me crazy i had to double check to make sure that i did n't leave the pod irom my last cup n the coffee maker weak coffee , flavor did n't appeal to me either might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side wolfgang 's vienna roast was pleasant though . 
love the flavor , but 12 of the cups in the 24 count box were misshapen melted , as if they 'd been exposed to heat during filling my husband used two of the ones that were not affected , so i'm not returning them , but certainly wish quality control had caught this the affected k cups are so misshapen they will not fit into the space in the keurig . 
the vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild , as i expected but i bought it for a discount from the amazon warehouse \( otherwise k cups are a little expensive \) when amazon does this , it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly br br as i expected , the expiration date is for a month or two from now , so they were trying to get rid of them i also noticed the seals did n't seem as tight as they normally are this also could be because it was sitting in amazon 's warehouse in the heat all summer br br as i expected , about half of these k cups burst open while brewing \( this is not usual , and i 've tried many different brands \) this made them leak \( so clean up was kind of annoying \) and not taste as fresh , but it still tasted decent bottom line when k cups are discounted from amazon warehouse , be ready to pay in other ways ! lol . 
this coffee is good and has nice subtle flavor i am disappointed though because i looked at the bottom and it says decaf i dunno bout you but i drink coffee for the caffeine in the picture on bottom of box has text but it is so small i did not even consider looking on it so just disappointed that is decaf and does not say on page when ordering . 
love the wolfgang puck restaurants , cookware , brand endorsed products , all his brand products cuisine are amazing , i am a loyal fan , yet this creme caramel coffee is tasteless , no real coffee flavor , no hint of caramel or creme , it brews like a bit of steamed milk , that somewhat pasty tasteless feel on your palate soooo dissapointed as i am such a loyal fan of all his brand , products sadly , a waste of funds , did not return because i think food items are none refundable . 
did n't realize it was flavored and thought , when i had my first sip , that it tasted like chemicals f gave it away the next day at work . 
good , but the green mountain reserve sumatra is better by 1 1 and a half stars sort of tastes a little stale . 
i love the names wolfgang puck gives to their coffees , but the coffee descriptions leave a lot to be desired br br in this case , with breakfast in bed , i expected a much more flavorful cup of coffee than delivered breakfast in bed is on the light side of the medium roasts and has a mild , but not very memorable flavor on the plus side , it is a smooth coffee and not acidic at all br br a better choice , in my opinion , is a href http www amazon com gp product b001chfudc coffee people donut shop medium roast , extra bold for keurig brewers , 24 count k cups \( pack of 2 \) a , which also comes in the 50 pack br br added another nice , smooth medium blend is a href http www amazon com gp product b002apwq0k timothy 's world coffee , kona blend for keurig brewers , medium , 50 count k cups a br br added for those who prefer a lighter smooth blend , try a href http www amazon com gp product b00196qvpm keurig green mountain coffee roasters 80 k cup colombian fair trade slect medium roast coffee a \( link for product description only , not for best pricing \) . 
one reviewer mentioned that this coffee was decaff and said it was listed as such on the bottom of the box \( in small print \) i checked my current box and saw no such labeling information however , the new boxes i received are a different color , with a slapped on label for hawaiian hazelnut and now the bottom of the box says it 's made from 100 decaff coffee while i like the flavor , i do not want decaff in the morning , which is when i drink coffee br br unfortunately , i am unable to return this item to amazon because of their return policy , which is why i'm writing this review , to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now i would give more stars for flavor , but the lack of official notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if i tossed my money out the window , buying something i would not have otherwise ordered . 
this flavor is horrible there are many other flavors much better hawaiian hazelnut is great ! breakfast in bed is awesome ! . 
i love my keurig coffee maker and i enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours a href http www amazon com gp product b003vxhgdm wolfgang puck coffee , creme caramel , 24 count k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 2 \) a seemed to be a safe choice i love coffee with cream i love caramel i even like wolfgang puck but his creme caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment it 's not awful it just lacks a certain depth of flavour even using the 'small cup' setting , the aroma is very nice , but the taste is a bit watery 'black' , the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste , but it did n't add any of the caramel creaminess i was expecting in short the coffee taste is very mild , and the caramel taste is n't all that great sorry wolfgang , but i'm afraid this one is a yawner . 
i like dark strong coffee but i just did n't really care for this one not sure what it really was , almost a tad bitter \? unfortunately i have another whole box of 24 to use up i picked up some sumatran reserve \( also a dark \) and prefer it . 
if you like your flavored coffee to taste like coffee , this may not be for you i could n't taste the coffee at all in the travel size brew , but the smaller brew sizes were a bit better . 
i got this coffee as part of a bold sampler pack while i found it flavorful i would n't call it bold my first wp k cup was french roast which i found extremely bitter this coffee does n't have that problem br br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano br br my favorite k cups are br starbucks french roast br starbucks caffe verona br starbucks pike place roast br green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve br green mountain double black diamond br green mountain revv br green mountain dark magic br br other k cups i 've tried coffee people jet fuel , green mountain dark magic decaf , emeril jazzed up decaf , starbucks caffe verona , coffee people black tiger , starbucks house blend , starbucks breakfast blend , starbucks sumatra , wolfgang puck french roast , green mountain lake and lodge , green mountain french roast , caribou mahogony , wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya , emeril big easy bold . 
if you like to taste the flavor in your flavored coffee , skip this one i 've struggled to taste the creme caramel flavoring that is supposed to be in here the coffee flavor is also slightly bitter , but that could just be my taste buds longing for some flavoring ! i 'd recommend green mountain , gloria jeans or van houtte brands before this one . 
i love my keurig but have n't found my perfect cup of coffee yet , although this comes close i prefer a medium brew , not bold or strong breakfast in bed is my choice so far . 
jamaica me crazy is a sweet , coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste it is not a bold blend , but rather a mild to medium blend that leans more mild br br this is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends i would consider it a second cup of morning coffee , afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee br br flavor is ok i would like it better if the aftertaste did n't linger for a flavored coffee , it is n't bad if you are a coconut fan , it is a blend to try on for size . 
vanilla flavor is barely noticeable acidic taste , not at all what i expected breakfast in bed and hawaiian hazelnut are much better choices . 
i recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at bed bath and beyond as its brewing , it smells great \( if you like coconut \) the taste is n't bad , but for me , it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have i gave it 3 stars because it 's not terrible but i would n't buy this coffee again if you 're sensitive to after taste , i would n't recommend i 'd grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee . 
i tried this coffee , even though it was significantly more expensive than the green mountain \( organic , free trade \) sumatra that i have been using for some time wolfgang puck has the name and the rep br br if this were the only sumatra dark roast on the market , i 'd be really happy with it this is good coffee br br it is not outstanding coffee compared to folgers , this product is awesome unfortunately for mr puck , i am comparing it to green mountain sumatra br br the organic and free trade sumatra from green mountain is better to my taste , and it is cheaper mornings are good . 
the coffee is good , however the k cup is not packaged well , the coffee machine barely streams coffee , more of a fast drip the whole idea is it 's fast , right \? . 
my hair dresser 's salon bought a keurig machine , so i have been able to sample a variety of k cups k cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so i have never considered buying one for myself , but having a keurig machine at a hair salon makes sense ! people have a variety of tastes and k cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that br br the salon has a nice variety of k cups folders , wolfgang puck , timothy 's , and green mountain \( that owns keurig \) br br everyone 's taste vary , but here is my assessment of the ones that i have tried so far wolfgang puck was my second favorite so far , i like folgers the best br br folgers gourmet br selections lively colombian br price per cup 69 cents \( package of 36 for 25 \) br earthy flavor , fruity and nutty flavors come through br br wolfgang puck chefs reserve colombian dark roast br price per cup 69 cents \( package of 48 for 32 98 \) br a dark roast with caramel and earthy notes , slight burnt br and papery flavors br br timothy's decaffeinated colombian medium br price per cup 60 cents \( package of 50 for 30 \) br a bit on the weak side , kind of papery , and less astringent than the others br br ali julia review . 
while good quality , it was not at all what i expected it smelled like caramel and vanilla , but it tasted like straight black coffee i was pretty disappointed . 
the coffee is just ok , a little weak the price is a little high and it is not worth the extra money . 
i was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is it has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak . 
taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before i mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning small print on the bottom of the box \( i mean 6 point font \) tells this several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine i do n't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale . 
too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase it 's not bold or dark enough to stand up to the keurig 's 3rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking . 
i personally did not care for the coffee , too mild for me and a little nutty flavor in it i will stick with tully 's kona and house blends , also emeril 's big easy bold . 
more than a hint of coconut ! not very much vanilla being a vanilla fan and not a coconut fan this is ok . 
this coffee is a lot like the green mountain nantucket blend if you like that , you 'll like this generally , the gm product costs less , but this was on sale . 
probably because it does n't taste like coffee it is flavorless i saw the good reviews and thought i 'd get a couple boxes and now i'm stuck with a bunch of k cups that i do n't want to drink because i 'd rather literally drink any other k cup i 've ever tried as you can see i'm not a fan of these k cups these are the worst ever . 
i will drink this if all other coffee options are exhausted the coffee has a vanilla coconut smell but after a sip or two , i ca n't drink it would not purchase again and i'm having trouble even giving it away i expected more from wolfgang puck . 
i love caramel and was excited when this arrived but i am so disappointed hardly any flavor at all , of coffee or caramel .

or the good reviewers' taste buds are weak this is some disappointingly br weak coffee i'm not some crazy gotta have my jet black sludge to get br through the day coffee drinker i 'd say my favorite \( and my wife 's \) is br caribou blend this blend is weak , it ca n't hold half and half or even br just whole milk without being wiped out now , i will say i brew it on br the large cup \( 9 25 oz , i believe \) setting on our keurig , so maybe it 's br a bit better on the 8oz setting , or even the small setting but caribou \( we br also like donut shop , green mountain kona blend 10 , etc \) can be easily br brewed on 9 25 and hold a good bold taste this coffee does n't br hold a candle to any of those now i'm stuck with 40 of these blech maybe br the guests wo n't mind it ! \) . 
i really love this coffee , great tasting and bold however , on about 1 3rd of the pods , the foil separates from the cup and blows grounds into the brewer and my coffee cup i can usually predict which ones will do it because the foil on the k cup is not puffy like it has pressure , but flat and wrinkled . 
it 's coconut flavored , either you 'll like it or not i was actually surprised since i'm not a big fan of coconut , but i liked this coffee not my favorite , but nice on occasion . 
i love the taste but have found that many of the cups explode ! ! the glue on the side of the cup becomes undone and then the cup explodes very hard to clean up do not think i will buy this brand again ! . 
this is less of a bold flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee my wife is easy to please and she 's not a fan i 'll finish the box but i reach of others first . 
the coffee is just ok it 's very mild , almost bordering on weak would buy it again if the price was right . 
bought this on the recommendation of my son not a big fan of flavored coffee , but a cup a day of this lightly flavored coconut coffee puts me in the islands how can you go wrong with wolfgang puck \? . 
this coffee says dark roast extra bold and it isn't ! it 's weak and barely beats out a cup of folgers . 
the flavor of this coffee is good , it has a nice balance of vanilla without being too strong it 's not the boldest coffee , but it 's a nice afternoon treat br br that being said , i have had problems with several pods when you hold them up to the light , you can see that there are grounds outside of the filter portion of the pod this causes a cup full of grounds when you brew the coffee , and also clogs up the pin at the bottom of the pod chamber i 'd say about 1 out of every 5 or 6 pods has this problem . 
i love the taste of this coffee but in my last order of four boxes about every other k cup has a tear or rip in the internal filter and thus the grounds flow through into the cup of coffee which wastes the value of the coffee as drinkable wolfgang needs to correct this flaw in packaging i will not order again because of the waste . 
i admit , i like my french vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side this is n't it 's a much stronger coffee brew , meaning more sugar and creamer is needed to tone down the coffee flavor on the other hand , it 's a reasonable alternative if my preferred brand \( van houtte \) is n't on sale or when it 's occasionally out of stock i like that it comes in a 2 pack because our family goes through a lot of k cups and i do n't have to order quite so often . 
10 years ago my daughter brought home creme' brulee' for the first time it was perfect , beans to be ground since then i have searched for anything similar when i realized i could n't find it , she had forgotten what one she purchased br br this one has a strong flavor , but it tastes fake with a strong after taste unfortunately it is one of the better ones if anyone reads this and knows what ones \( carmel and vanilla \) , taste great , please post here . 
i really like the taste of this coffee ! my only complaint is that the coffee grinds end up in my coffee not a huge fan of that and even though i really like the taste of it i will not order again , bummer ! ! \( . 
i thought the coffee tasted fine it was not strong enough for my husband several of the pods burst during brewing i probably wo n't purchase this again . 
i bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite \( jet fuel or emeril 's big intense bold \) liked this one typically sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well br br i am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label br it is not bold it is extremely mild and smoky tasting not a single member of my family liked it and that 's very unusual br br i'm going to contact the company to see if they 'll exchange it or refund me it is that bad . 
as coffee in general , this wolfgang variety was alright however , i was expecting a creme caramel taste , or something similar , and i do n't feel this delivered i tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just did n't do it for me it is marketed as a flavored coffee , yet i could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee . 
this is a good french roast coffee , although it could be a little bolder i 've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup it 's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess . 
i got this is a low cost alternative to my normal jet fuel and it just did n't measure up i like strong coffee but this had a bitter taste that i just did n't care for also , 3 of the cups had some sort of malfunction and dumped their grinds into my cup not sure why . 
this coffee is not a true medium roast like caribou french roast , donut house , etc there was not much coffee flavor at all i found it to be so weak in flavor that not only did i have to go down a brew size , but i also have to add less milk just too drink it i will never buy it again wish i did n't have 45 more cups to go thru ! . 
i ordered wolf gang puck 's k cups , largely because of his reputation and my experiences at his restaurants , both of which are good however , when i drank my first cup of the breakfast blend , i tasted no coffee it was as if i was drinking hot water i was very disappointed and will purchase only those k cups which i know to be good sorry wolf gang , this is a sleeper ! . 
i was expecting a mellow caramel flavor , but this coffee is a bit sharp and you really ca n't make out any carmel flavor . 
i am only drinking it , so it wo n't be wasted , and i have to rotate it with a coffee people product , so i remember why i like coffee it is really wan the strongest flavor profile is tin i love creme caramel and am a huge wp fan , but the flavor strenth and consistancy of this coffee does not impress choose another you wo n't be sorry you did . 
my favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like french , italian , and full city this k cup dark roast has a big , bold flavor , but lacks balance the level of smokiness , bitterness , and acid are way too high , and the result is not enjoyable i liked the dark roasts for the keurig from green mt , newman , and donut shop much more than this one . 
i love wolfgang puck products but the coffee is very disappointing br there is a weak flavor almost tastes diluted ! br some troll must have changed out all the real puck products ! br libbie . 
this is the 1st k cup coffee that i am getting grounds in my coffee it is occuring about every 3 cups i have not had this problem with other k cup manufactures i will not reorder . 
i bought a 24 pack of this an drank almost all of them before realizing what the flavor reminded me of it tastes like hotdog water . 
it seems the flavor selection on amazon has been limited these days to some variation of hazelnut , french vanilla or chocolate so when i saw this one , i thought i 'd give it a try never having had wolfgang puck 's k cups , i was hoping they 'd be as good as the wolfgang puck coffee i 've had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas , i was mistaken i would n't say it 's the worst i 've had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too i feel like i'm drinking coffee that 's been made with grounds that have already been perked in other words the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and i'm getting leftovers br br if you 're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that does n't really taste like much of anything , this is your pod if you 're looking for better , richer flavors , stick with green mountain which sadly amazon does n't seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge 60 for a box ! . 
i tried a double boxes of this when the donut shop coffee i usually order was unavailable while the coffee is pretty good the cups suck a full 1 3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable they are slow to brew \( coffee maker has to work very hard \) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed they could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee i believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable . 
i like bold coffees and should have trusted the other reviewer who said it was n't strong enough this one has a watery finish to it and not very much flavor i 'll be going back to emeril 's jazz 'd up decaf and trying the coffee people 's french roast decaf so far i 've loved everything by the coffee people except the organic blend if you like strong coffee do n't buy this but if you like a weaker coffee that you can see through you 'd probably enjoy this one . 
i love this coffee ! i am not a strong coffee drinker and this coffee is perfect ! i have no problems with it working in my cuisinart keurig brewer , i aways get the perfect tasting cup of coffee br br i gave it 3 stars because one of the 2 packs contained only 13 k cups and not the 24 that it was supposed to have br br the decaf 24 count \( pack of 2 \) arrived with the correct amount of k cups and is as yummy as the high test ! . 
this was the nastiest flavored coffee i have ever had in kcups i purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag it smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what i expected i will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees this was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last i order of his brand i thought maybe i got a bad cup but i brewed 3 and i opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness . 
i thought it had a bitter orange flavor , however my husband and friend liked it . 
we have tried just about every k cup of regular coffee out there we do n't do the flavor kind my husband loves the gm brand most of the coffees are mild \( even when they say medium roast \) i go for a little more on the medium roast like the some of the tully 's and caribou brands it used to be that we were always ordering the same brands , once we liked a certain one but i ventured to try the wolfgang puck line while this flavor is touted as a medium roast , it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness it is still not a bad coffee , just not as good as the rodeo drive or breakfast in bed k cups which has no bitterness i must say though , we have now added the latter 2 flavors of wolfgang to our buying ritual . 
my husband likes strong coffee i like medium neither one of us like this particular one there just is n't much flavor of any kind coffee or caramel we like the vanilla one much better we 'll drink this until it 's gone but it 's the last flavor we choose , and it 's lasting way too long ! . 
the taste is fine , but the k cup container has opened at the seal during the brewing process on more than one occasion , resulting in a mouthful of coffee grounds ! i have never had this happen with any other brand of k cup before and hope it is not the norm for wolfgang puck . 
i prefer the extra bold coffees , so this one really lacking on the flavor it 's fairly weak , at the smallest cup setting its drinkable , but i wo n't be buying it again i 'd recommend the timothy 's world coffee , rainforest decaf espresso instead . 
taste is okay not blown away hidden is the fact that this is truly a decaffeinated coffee only place to find this out is on the bottom of the box not what i want first thing in the morning . 
i am not a fan of flavored coffee and i thought i had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did i see any indication that it was a flavored coffee i wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is jamaican coffee . 
i use to purchase jamaica beans locally and it was great this jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it the odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale other people in household tried it and could n't get past the first cup pitched the remainder cups in the trash . 
this coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong , but i have to say it almost ruined my months' old keurig personal brewer the coffee is ground so finely that when the k cups are punctured by the needles \( top and bottom \) , it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles , going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty sludge in the bottom of each cup i purchased a pack of 2 \( 48 k cups \) and did n't even use one full pack i do not recommend this brand or blend it is a waste of money , which is something i could n't really afford at this time i sent a letter of complaint to the wolfgang puck company and , except for a cookie cutter letter acknowledging receipt of my comment , i have not received any further contact from them . 
unfortunately , i'm much too frugal to throw away something i 've spent perfectly good money on , so i'm continuing to use these suckers until they 're gone \( hopefully in a few weeks \) i thought i was buying a decent brand of coffee , given the wolfgang puck name , but alas , i was wrong using the middle cup size on my keurig coffeemaker , these k cups make a weak cup of coffee more like brown water no taste , no nothing i switched to the smallest size cup and it 's marginally better , but still barely drinkable i would n't serve these to guests ever i ca n't wait to be done with these boxes of junk so i can order something with some taste please do n't waste your money . 
this was terrible coffee wolfgang pucks jamaicamecrazy , i received a partial refund but felt i should have gotten a full refund as i ca n't drink the coffee and had to throw it all away also had to pay shipping and should not of had to i would like a response to this . 
the aroma is pleasant , and flavor is nice and smooth , but it is very , very weak i really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save , but i just cannot recommend it even making smaller cups it is very weak i'm going to stick to newman 's own organics extra bold as my go to k cup for now . 
i had tried green mountain sumatra reserve and found it delicious and strong it 's not available on subscribe and save so i read the reviews and opted for wolfgang puck my husband likes it and i like the flavour but it 's very weak in comparison to the green mountain i have to order something else for me . 
we love hazelnut coffee , but this just did n't have enough coffee flavor in it for me kind of on the weak side in my opinion i 'll keep looking . 
i admit , i am not terribly fond of flavored coffees but , this one is not for us we both love the rodeo drive i have a good freind that loves this coffee i sent her ours . 
i found this coffee to be great at first , but as i started having it more and more i came to detest it on the large setting the coffee is way too watery also , the flavor is very , very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas br br it is a pretty good mid afternoon or evening desert coffee , but other than that it is kinda gross . 
i am definitely not a coffee connoisseur , but this stuff is bad it is a disappointment because i expected a wolfgang puck product to have more class this tastes artificial and it ca n't stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener will not buy again ! . 
really \? who blends this stuff and decides that it is good \? ugh i can sum this nastyness up in one quick phrase stale airline coffee ! if you like that flavor , then you will love this one , if you do n't like thin cardboard soaked , never washed the pot out , and the water came from a tin canteen , flavored coffee , then you wo n't like this one either ! i would give this zero stars if i could wow , likely the worst cup of coffee that i have ever had i hope wolfy reads this as his name is on the package and i expected more , now i know not to buy any of his signature products , awesome , thanks for saving me next time ! the package says extra bold , but it does n't taste extra bold it 's almost like they put some ground instant powder in the mix to make it stronger . 
the coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt i cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt will not order this again . 
i'm amazed that people are happy with this product i'm not a drinker of the dark brews , french roast or anything , but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee , this is completely tasteless the initial scent is delicious , too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee . 
i got this through a decaf keurig assortment pack \( also from amazon \) and while i have enjoyed all of the flavors thisone was so weak i had to post a review . 
to me this coffee was extremely bitter i dumped it out and made a different cup it made me afraid to try other wp coffees but i did like the wp sumatra kopi raya br br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano br br my favorite k cups are br starbucks french roast br starbucks caffe verona br starbucks pike place roast br green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve br green mountain double black diamond br green mountain revv br green mountain dark magic br br other k cups i 've tried coffee people jet fuel , green mountain dark magic decaf , emeril jazzed up decaf , starbucks caffe verona , coffee people black tiger , starbucks house blend , starbucks breakfast blend , starbucks sumatra , wolfgang puck french roast , green mountain lake and lodge , green mountain french roast , caribou mahogony , wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya , emeril big easy bold . 
coffee is a very subjective thing some people like coffee that borders on tea , others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous battlestar galactica pilot serves for the record , i love the slightly sour taste of dunkin donuts coffee and i find the stuff made by that other chain to be akin to re hydrated cigarette ash for many years , we still percolated coffee with most big name brands of pre ground coffee , you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it , but again , your tastes may vary br br with my keurig , my favorite coffee was paul neumans extra bold because it did n't seem extra bold until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor then , my favorites were the caribu 's but something happened to that brand \( see reviews \) and i agree , they did something either they do n't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend , the sourcing of the beans , etc wasted money on caribu and wont go back to the brand br br so wolfgang puck got the nod , tried 4 different flavors this one , sorrento , is not my favorite of the bunch \( currently colombian chef 's reserve \) it has a bolder strength \( which i believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider medium \) , but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it cream and sweetener do n't correct for this , and thus i'm a bit disappointed but again it was a stab in the dark br br i think if you prefer a slightly bolder , slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee this may be for you i like the character of the colombian chef 's reserve , but it is not as strong , and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards i do n't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the wolfgang puck line however ca n't say the same for some other k cup brands . 
this wolfgang puck coffee jamaica me crazy is the worst coffee i 've ever had ! br i threw it out right away after one sip ! it taste like all coconut flavoring br hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable they should be fired ! . 
ugh no where on the amazon page for this item did it state that it was hazelnut flavored i have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it thought it was going to be a blue mountain like jamaican coffee . 
this coffee is only mediocre in quality i do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do i like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date the only reason i am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that i paid very little for it by using a credit i had at amazon payments i do not recommend this coffee . 
if keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular k cup , keurig would be out of business wolfgang puck french roast melange francais is inexcusably terrible coffee aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old kwiki mart carafe mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating the after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth i simply could n't believe my keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee , so i tried again a week later with same results i use average to good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like green mountain , tulleys , nor emeril 's everyone i know that has a keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup usually the results are stunning , and the keurig invasion lives on when i share i 'll stick with offering the coffee peoples' black tiger or jet fuel now i have 22 more wp fr k cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of let me know if you want them , as i 'd be embarrassed to even give them away sorry wolfgang , but what the puck your french roast is unpardonably horrible , and at k cup prices i 'll not be duped again i 'll stay away from any of the other wp offerings . 
this stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells my son did n't like it either and i ended up throwing it out . 
ok today 4 15 this company decided to put them up for sale at 12 50 per 24pk this advertisement was on slickdeals net br br well went to order and refreshed the page and in my cart was now 1 at 36 dollars \? \? \? \? so they sold one out of my cart br next i waited 20 mins to see if it was a fluke and sd net started claiming dead link br br well upon refreshing again they were now 44 95 for one 24 pack br br hey ridiculous seller get with the program if this is your way of recovering quick money i think people are much smarter then that upon pressing confirm my order round of applause to you for being so un tech savy . 
no thanks kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard organic bold and donut shop are still our faves . 
the worst ! ! ! it is just plan awful bitter and strong and you cannot taste the hazel nut flavor at all ! ! ! ! ! do not buy this product save your money ! ! ! ! ! . 
k cups are marginally better than good coffee that i can buy at the store for 1 2 the price or less this product was offered at 19 95 and i was willing to purchase it but it immediately went up to 26 95 it is not really worth 19 95 and is certainly not worth any increase additionally , what 's the deal on offering instant coffee in k cups for 15 99 leaving us to think it 's a good deal on real coffee do you want to lose our trust \( business \) \? \? \? \? that 's a good way to do it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! br jb . 
i thought this coffee was really horrible had one cup and will throw the rest away because it ca n't be returned . 
i ordered the vanilla coffee for my college age children unfortunately , there were shipping delays and it did not arrive until the kids had returned to college for the fall semester update to come when they finally come home for a break it may be a while the other coffees i have ordered have all been tasty and a very good value , i have no reason to believe this will be any different i can say that the k cups and the keurig have been delightful i enjoy having a freshly brewed cup every time and like that i save a bunch of money by brewing at home into a travel mug rather than stopping to drop 2 00 for a cup on the way to work saves all those styrofoam cups too ! . 
i bought both the creme caramel and this hazelnut kcup and i could n't tell them apart even if my life depended on it the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too and unlike the caramel one , this one has a nasty bitter aftertaste like the flavor is artificial yeah , i know it 's artificial but i hate that it actually tastes like a chemical ! yuk br br this is one of those coffees you can serve to company who does n't know good coffee or people you do n't want to have come to your house any more as one cup of this and they wo n't be your friends after it ! it really is quite bad . 
this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of 6 people there are 6 people in my shop we all hate it not good . 
i was so excited to try a new bold coffee needless to say , i am disappointed i would rate this coffee as a medium if it would have been listed as a medium , i would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a medium strength coffee in taste and flavor i will still drink it from time to time flavor is smooth , not bitter overall , i wish that i would have ordered some more jet fuel or black tiger . 
so here is another example of a 48 pack of k cups i bought untested i figured , well , i really enjoy sumatra 's bold , smooth and rich with a bit of bitterness flaver , so why not \? wolfgang puck has a few restaurants , so maybe he knows coffee br br so , this is utterly average in all departments it 's not very bold or rich , although i can say it does have the bitterness , which is a bit unbalanced as it lacks the richness purchased only because it appeared on the subscribe save at a great price per k cup that makes two wp 's that have been run of the mill at best sumatra french roast next time i 'll be more discerning . 
i really like to mix things up with k cups and rarely buy 50 ct boxes of a single flavor exception to the rule would be for dark , bold coffees such as french roasts , which i really enjoy so when wolfgang puck 's french roast turned up on amazon 's deal of the week , even though i have never tried before , now i have 48 units br br it 's fairly non descript for a french roast decent aroma , but taste is muted compared to , for example , a diedrich french roast i do n't hate or even dislike it , it 's 'okay' , and for the price i paid , is acceptable without complaint it may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich br br i 'd call it mildly bold , average , and i wo n't be going out of my way to keep it on hand . 
wolfgang puck 's breakfast in bed is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one . 
this is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe it 's artificially flavored , and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it my household hated it of course , that would be my problem if the description was accurate , but it 's not amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page . 
first , let me say that i prefer extra bold k cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend , and never decaf i bought three wolfgang puck coffees several months ago rodeo drive blend french roast and sumatra kopi raya all three are quite drinkable , though they do not measure up to a few of the extra bold blends from coffee people kona blend organic blend jet fuel and black tiger even better than these , though , is my new favorite , a href http www amazon com gp product b003m7ttyg green mountain 's revv a those who prefer a strong , dark cup of coffee \( even at the larger mug setting \) should try that brand br br previously , i had found the dark roast green mountain coffees rather boring , but revv lives up to the hype , both in strength and flavor another great green mountain coffee is their espresso blend \( though amazon does n't stock it , so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick and mortar stores such as bed bath and beyond \) finally , a favorite regular over the years has been a href http www amazon com gp product b004m5w7yq emeril 's big easy bold a it 's a very nice coffee , though do n't expect the new orleans experience of chicory flavor br br bottom line you wo n't go wrong with the wolfgang puck coffees , but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees . 
of all the k cup flavors that are out there , and there are many very good ones , this is one of my least favorites , and i have tried almost all of them not much flavor to this one , even if you add various types of creamers of course , it is all a matter of taste , but this one does n't taste all that good it is not bad it is just kind of there like a generic coffee try something else instead . 
the coffee was more on the light side rather than medium roast i do n't think i would purchase it again even though it was a good value purchase . 
as coffee , these kcups are just ok as flavored coffee these are disappointing i found the vanilla to be barely detectable . 
after receiving this coffee i made a few cups it was fairly smooth , not too overpowering , and had a slight mocha aroma it 's ok coffee i likely will not purchase this one again because there are so many better ones to gauge my review for others , my favorites are coffee people donut shop , green mountain dark magic , coffee people organic bold , emeril 's big easy bold , and tully 's kona blend . 
i really like medium strength coffee but this is a little too bold to be considered medium it is almost bitter when compared to other medium coffees . 
this coffee is okay but certainly not as good as green mountain 's breakfast blend it just does n't taste as good . 
this is a great flavored coffee nevertheless , k cups are getting too expensive for everyday home use i am now using the filler and using my own ground coffee much of the time it 's also helpful to look for other price alternatives . 
disappointing while folks like to say tofu has no flavor , i can discern a type of neutrality and this br one is the blankest of blank slates br br wet , watery , gelatinous , it is not a product i will buy again soon i got it because shopping is br a challenge br br it 's not awful , just disappointing the benefits are the packaging and that is has shelf life . 
eye bought this product on a recommendation however , eye cannot seem to get past the strange taste yet eye will keep using it to see if this will pass or if eye will acquire a liking to it the package states no bitter taste if it is a sweetener , why should there be any bitter taste \? . 
are these people crazy or can i not multiple properly \? this is 43 for 24 small cups of peaches that works out to 7 for the 4 pack this 4 pack cost about 3 50 in a grocery store in the states but because i'm deployed i'm suppose to pay 7 for it \? ! not happening netgrocer com is 4 00 higher than a grocercy store , but cheaper than this ! . 
product has a shelf life of two years and was labeled as produced in december of 2009 product leaked from seal in carton . 
very difficult to work with tends to turn to solid rock even when following directions taste is less than desirable . 
i bought duck rillettes from amazon because my usual favorite duck rillette was not carried anymore by chefshop com i was expecting a really good rillette full flavored rillette what i got was a rellette that lacked even flavor of duck and herbs spices the texture was good however tasted more like a pork rillette i would not recommend rouge perigord duck rillettes . 
the product description says you are purchasing 6 boxes of 25 tea bags i received only one box i called amazon and they said that the quantity i received was correct and the description is wrong they made it right , but should n't have had to beware ! ! . 
as a spice mix fan , i make a point of trying multiple products on food both fun and fattening in equal measure ! i 've also highlighted what i think are the standout mixes in chef tom 's line a href http www amazon com gp product b000m5tthi chef tom douglas rub with love salmon rub a and a href http www amazon com gp product b000m5ttl4 chef tom douglas rub with love chicken rub a br br that said , this mix is a delicious treat , but it does n't hold the attention of the taste buds like the standouts the primary notes are supposedly ancho chiles and smoked paprika , but overall the tastes are muddled and do n't provide a 'zing' to the dish br br it 's a very tasty addition on multiple items such as tri tip and pot roast but not enough to justify the gourmet price it is also too heavy a mix to work well on chicken , fish , or to drizzle over a meat pasta dish br br note surprisingly , the best pairings from chef tom for red meats are either the a href http www amazon com gp product b000m5nkuk chef tom douglas rub with love pork rub a or a generous portion of a href http www amazon com gp product b000m5ttl4 chef tom douglas rub with love chicken rub a . 
i am not happy about writing this review i had very high expectations from both the name and the high praise given by the other reviewers i was at once concerned , however , based on the weak aroma at first opening and , these initial concerns were confirmed at first use little flavor here i have found a home recipe based off of the ingredient list with stuff from my spice rack produces a much better result br br beef rub brown sugar , sea salt , paprika , chille , rosemary , fresh garlic , chipotle powder , cumin , and mccormick montreal steak seasoning br br chicken rub brown sugar , paprika , sea salt , chille , mccormick montreal chicken seasoning , curry , garlic , cinnamon , and chinese five spices . 
and the expiration date on top of the can says jan 06 , 05 i cannot even return it since it is a grocery amazon , are you serious \? . 
when i bought this food , i saw the image and price and assumed that i would be paying a fair price \( 1 less per bag than the grocery store \) for low grade cat food the image and price combination led me to think that i would be paying 45 for 6 18lb bags a good deal when i received six 3 6lb bags , i thought there had been a mistake nope so , i spend 40 returning it \( i bought three 6 packs oops \) and now ozbo customer service tells me they take 2 3 weeks processing returns ! my kitties need food now , and these people want to sit on my 180 for that long \? do not buy from these scammers ! ! ! . 
i'm on a low sodium diet and use this product regularly think it is very good try their salsa couple of jars of this a couple of jars of another pasta suace , spices , seasonings , etc however , the 44 00 shipping cost is a major rip off try one of two or three sites on google you will save 20 00 to 30 00 a case . 
this is a good product , especially for iced coffee , but why is it twice the price as it is in stores \? this is n't a fluke within the past two months i 've bought it for 5 a jar in seattle and in nevada , so it just looks like good old fashioned gouging try harder amazon . 
this is really a normal taste coffee i would not buy more after i finish this one in fact , i will still be sleepy after drinking two cups ! . 
the party i had you send this product to , is enjoying it immensley he is unable to purchase this product in arizona obviously , certain products are not available in his location and i was happy to help out i want to thank you for your quick response in securing this request and i am sure he will look to order it in the future thank you mario . 
medaglia d'oro has to be the worst coffee i 've ever had it had an old musty flavor and odor you get what pay for . 
i of course prefer freshly made espresso but sometimes instant is good in a pinch i travel around europe extensively and there are several brands available there which are n't at all bad this brand is ok for using it as a coffee flavoring in custards , etc , but as a beverage , it rates rock bottom in my book . 
not quiet what i was expecting the cherries were dried and could not taste the brandy the dark chocolate was good but too crunchy . 
i purchased this as a gamble , because there was no product information listed , so i had no idea how much i was getting or exactly what was in it i was disappointed that the large tin , was not all that large it was a round tin , approximately 4 inches tall , and maybe 7 or 8 inches across i was hoping that large , especially for the price , would be one of the large and tall tins it 's difficult to tell from the picture the product itself was good , but for the price , i was expecting more i 'd probably buy from them again . 
honestly these cookies could have been better i would buy them again if the shipping was n't so ridiculous ! i think it ended up being like 15 dollars for a few tiny cookies what a ripoff . 
i usually order bustelo decaffeinated coffee and i am used to the taste being the same as regular espresso i tried this lavazza decaf espresso and i am extremely disappointed it 's really obvious when you taste it that it is decaffeinated and tastes like it is processed i ordered the 4 pack and would really like to send back the three that i have n't opened yet if i can do that . 
this decaf is ok it is a medium roast , not a dark roast \( says it on the can , but not in the description here \) also , unlike another reviewer , i think that it is ground very fine . 
we 've only used this once , but it kept us awake most of the night we were surprised because it 's decaf , but we could n't sleep for hours after going to bed tastes good , though . 
i was hopeful , but left unsatisfied the color of the bean grounds says it all a light brown not the typical dark brown to black of real espresso , even decaf taste is weak and odd , not rich and solid certainly not worth the extra recommend cafe bustelo instead . 
before i ordered this coffee , i read reviews both here at amazon and on other sites i used reviewers comments to base my decision to purchase it i am a lover of starbucks espresso decaf coffee i have my own breville espresso machine at home i have been using starbucks for years my lavazzo coffee arrived and i was eager to give it a try i opened the tin to find brown coffee while i already knew i would be disappointed because i already know i prefer black coffee beans to brown while it pulled a decent looking cup , i put it to my mouth only to find it did not match my tastebuds one sip was all it took for me to hand it off to my husband so my verdict here is , if you are like me and enjoy only black bean coffee do not buy this product if you prefer brown bean coffee , give it a go . 
t may be expresso grind , but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker think again bitter when drunk on own marginally better when combined with milk in cappuchino i shoulda known betta ! . 
these jelly beans were very unusual when they showed up they came in a package without a jelly belly logo , the jelly beans themselves had no jelly belly logo , and i do n't really know if they were actually jelly bellys i got them as a gift , so i did n't try any of them , but it was odd giving a gift where it did n't seem like they were anything special , like i 'd bagged up some licorice jelly beans from the grocery store or something , big woop so i was disappointed and because they were a gift i had no idea what they tasted like so were they really jelly bellys \? who knows \? i felt silly giving them though . 
i would not buy this particular yogi tea again because i hate the taste of licorice anise the flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant , making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which was n't what i was hoping for with my burning throat i think a better blend would be something with more heat like ginger , which is why i usually drink yogi 's cold season instead , for the same purpose br br with a sore throat , its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea did n't do that . 
in general i like walker 's products i tried to avoid ordering cookies this year and try the oatcakes they are n't very good the flavor is very mild wheat \( maybe like a triscuit \? \) , but the texture is off putting they are chewy and make me think of eating cardboard i tried them with soup , with cheese , and with peanut butter they were tolerable with peanut butter maybe someone else has discovered a better way to eat them \? . 
i was thinking of purchasing these oakcakes however , in reading the ingredients , i do n't see oats listed are these oakcakes without oats \? br br wheat flour , vegetable oils , sugar , wheat bran , invert sugar syrups , salt , skimmed milk powder , raising agent . 
i ordered this for my birthday i got birthday money from family , and i ordered a couple of goodies , perfume , and this cocoa i love hot chocolate , and i'm always looking for new ones to try based on the first review i decided to go ahead and order i will probably not reorder mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness it also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste i like hershey 's bliss raspberry chocolate much better i 've been adding one spoonful of the cobblestone kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost but , by itself , it does not stand up to the test i plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa . 
my first time having curry rice br br but boy , i cooked this stuff exactly how you 're supposed to br br taste was n't bad , i guess , a little strong though br br it was thick , like ice slush it was over bearing and the spice was pretty intense br br i do n't think i 'll get it again i guess it 's good stuff , seen it in some curry making videos used often , but not for me , as it it is way to thick br br i had potatoes , onions , and pork prepared to perfection mixed with it and i could not taste them , at all i could not taste the pork , or anything only the sauce . 
we tried this formula because it is lactose free , my baby does not have any other issues , just lactose intolerant br we found that it smells bad , does not mix well into water and my baby would not drink a drop . 
these steaks came out really good , but the bacon does n't have much flavor and does n't seem to add to the steaks the size of the steaks are perfect though and i would recommend it unless you are looking for a lot of bacon flavor . 
good idea but the company should use a better soil compound maybe darker it 's hard to tell if the soil is wet or dry present compound blows away when i water it finally sprouted and i 'll transpant to a regular top soil when it grows more at least with soil , you can tell when it 's dry right now , i will give it small amounts of water weekly until that happens very disappointed with this product . 
i bought two bags of these , thinking it was the same product that i used to buy in different packaging \( light blue , with a see through dog shape against a grass green background \) unfortunately , it was completely not the same thing ! these treats were actually like jerky tough and brittle i give my dog soft treats because he does n't chew the damn things , and he choked on these horrible things i had to toss them out br br note that the zuke 's jerky naturals with the other packaging \( http www amazon com zukes jerky naturals beef dp b00008dfpy \) have always been moist and soft , and i 've never had a problem with those i suspect that this batch was not new packaging , as i had thought , but very old packaging these may be the same treats i usually feed my dog , just having sat on a shelf for years in any case , these were completely different treats , and not safe to feed my dog . 
if your dog likes naked bars then this is the same consistency it 's hard and sometimes my dog will eat it sometimetimes he 'll just leave it it 's quite hard . 
we have two cats and four dogs the cats seemed to like this treat but the dogs turned up their noses at it one of them , a chiweenee , eats just about everything and he would not touch it he tried it and left it laying on the floor . 
under the product features it says all meats are sourced in the usa i got the lamb and rice jerky today and it says on the package the lamb comes from new zealand that 's a huge misrepresentation of this product on the product page very disappointed . 
my chihuahuas like this treat , but they do not eat it with enthusiasm they hesitate and let it sit quite often . 
this is the most useful info you will ever need to know about k cups , and one that took me forever to discover br br bold extra bold coffee in terms of k cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger , it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee br br there ! now you know br br my mom goes for the extra bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now , and she 's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck \( or rather mine , since i buy it for her \) br br unfortunately , out of all the extra bold k cups she 's tried , she claims that the wolfgang puck is the weakest tasting she 's tried it in both the medium small serving sizes format , and both have produced less than full flavor drinks br br if you are looking for a rich , flavorful , strong tasting coffee , try the a href http www amazon com gp product b001hkzz7a van houtte cafe honduras medium roast , extra bold coffee , 24 count k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 2 \) a . 
this coffee brews very weak like a light roast w p chef 's reserve pods are just over half full put pod on scale and it 's 15 less coffee wgt than normal pods stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee . 
i wanted to like this coffee , i did we 've tried other wolfgang puck k cups and have been pleasantly surprised this just did not impress us bitter aftertaste , and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor smells great while brewing , but just does not live up to it in the cup i'm really disappointed because i now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink ! great price though . 
this is a good decaf coffee , but i 've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup it 's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess . 
warning this is a strong flavor br br i thought that this would be blue mountain y oh no it is like rum flavored or something yuk . 
with so many choices now , i thought i woudl give this a try br the donut shop decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short . 
i bought this because amazon had drastically increased the price on what i usually buy , so i thought i 'd try something new i normally drink coffee people donut shop , which is a nice , strong cup of coffee this was a little disappointing it 's called a medium roast , but when i brew a large cup \( my keurig has 3 size options \) , it looks like strong tea very light in color it makes a very weak cup of coffee when i brew the smallest cup possible , it 's a tiny bit better , but i prefer a large cup of strong coffee think i may try the rodeo drive or sorrento , but this one is just too weak and light for me \( oddly enough , the first time i tried donut shop , i thought it was too strong as i had been used to weaker coffees now that i 've started drinking the stronger varieties , it 's hard to go back to brown water \) . 
very good tasteing product but i need to use it the smallist setting on my b 60 to really enjoy the depth . 
as a french roast fan , i bought this brand of k cup with high expectations , considering the name attached to it i was disappointed it has a hearty aroma and full bodied flavor but leaves a bitter aftertaste br br if you 're a lover of the more robust roasts , i would recommend trying the a href http www amazon com gp product b002l41y8a coffee people kona blend island style , extra bold k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 50 \) a instead it is a smooth blend with none of the bitterness that delivers that kick you 're likely looking for . 
this flavored k cup is n't out of this world , but is n't horrible in my opinion , it 's way more flavorful than the wolfgang puck hazelnut k cup we love flavored coffee in our house , and so i would go with this one again worth a try . 
nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored i'm still not sure what flavor it is some type of nut i wrongly assumed that jamaican coffee would be similar to the blue mountain coffee which jamaica is known for ! how silly of me to assume that ! i hate flavored coffees so i was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee it only says flavored very small on the box so i did n't notice it before i opened it hopefully i can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee flavored coffee for myself ! . 
no where in the description does it mention that this is a flavored coffee by the name i thought it was a jamaican blue mountain blend but its flavored with a weak tasting hazelnut not very good . 
i was in a hurry and did not read the reviews i trusted amazon 's description and it did not indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was not jamaican it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad i feel cheated . 
i thought this was a jamaican blend or roast , but turns out it 's simply a heavily flavored coffee the flavor tastes artificial like fake maple syrup flavoring we have three coffee drinkers in our house and none of us could get past the first few sips now i have to find a home for the rest of it so it does n't go to waste . 
i wish amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee this stuff tastes the way i imagine newman 's own extra bold coffee would taste with curdled , spoiled bailey 's irish cream dumped in it nasty shudder ! ! ! . 
i drink about 4 to 6 cups of coffee every morning i'm always looking for a new flavor so i gave it a try i drank it but i would not order again steve . 
i like strong , but smooth coffee this coffee is strong enough , but a little on the bitter side for my taste i have tasted other strong blends that i like much more my husband , who likes a medium roast coffee , is ok with this coffee , but it not his favorite either i would only recommend it to someone who likes a little tang in their morning cup of joe . 
first of all , i have owned a keurig for about 4 years now , and i 've tried lot 's of coffee during that time , i have had an occasion k cup that did n't function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds br br i probably should have returned these before i bothered to open the second box since i drink my coffee from a thermal cup , i can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks br br i have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee its a bit like russian roulette , and i 've started straining it after i brew it br br i know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the green mountain , timothy 's or tully 's that i also use the good cups are a bit weak for my taste , but the flavor is ok definitely prefer not to waste 's on a product with a manufacturing defect . 
i'm not a gourmet coffee critic , but this stuff is disappointing based upon previous good reviews , i suspect that the coffee in the k cups i received is not the same they may have changed the manufacturing the wolfgang puck decaf i received is lifeless , watery , and tasteless there 's no aroma when it 's brewing in the keurig never again . 
coffee tastes great , but the cups get torn apart when brewing what a mess that is ! ! i am quite disappointed because i do like this flavor of coffee ! ! . 
perhaps my expectations were too high when i see the name wolfgang puck , i expect to be impressed this \( to my taste \) is very average tasting coffee to be fair , it is billed as a medium roast , and that 's what it is however , it 's just too bland for my taste br br if you want decaf with more character , try green mountain coffee 's dark magic decaf a href http www amazon com gp product b006n3i2sk green mountain coffee decaf dark magic , k cup portion pack for keurig brewers 24 count a , or emeril 's jazzed up decaf a href http www amazon com gp product b004616b3y emeril 's jazzed up decaf 48 k cups a they are darker roasts though , so if you want a milder coffee the wolfgang puck might be what you are looking for . 
i tried this product solely for the fact it has wolfgang 's name on it i should have stuck with timothy 's brand this was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee , more like a dinner coffee i will not be buying this again , also way too expensive compared to the others . 
it sure would be nice if they stated anywhere in the description of this coffee that it is flavored i love the bed and breakfast coffee , it 's just plain coffee , so i was surprised when i received the jamaica coffee and it was flavored yuck ! . 
i ordered 3 boxes of 18 each and opened one box to find they were pods and not br for keurig , and i ca n't return them ! ! ! \? \? \? \? \? yes , the pods fit into the keurig but br the end product is weak and awful i am most disappointed . 
the coffee is good however , at least half of these have n't been sealed correctly when i brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere not fun to clean it may have just been the batch we got , but i wo n't be ordering these again . 
well the creme caramel was on sale so i decided to give it a shot plus the fact that each k cup is individually prepared by mr puck himself anyway i quite enjoy these i never buy flavored ones so overall i'm happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as i usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild . 
honestly the first time i tried jamaica me crazy i had to double check to make sure that i did n't leave the pod irom my last cup n the coffee maker weak coffee , flavor did n't appeal to me either might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side wolfgang 's vienna roast was pleasant though . 
love the flavor , but 12 of the cups in the 24 count box were misshapen melted , as if they 'd been exposed to heat during filling my husband used two of the ones that were not affected , so i'm not returning them , but certainly wish quality control had caught this the affected k cups are so misshapen they will not fit into the space in the keurig . 
the vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild , as i expected but i bought it for a discount from the amazon warehouse \( otherwise k cups are a little expensive \) when amazon does this , it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly br br as i expected , the expiration date is for a month or two from now , so they were trying to get rid of them i also noticed the seals did n't seem as tight as they normally are this also could be because it was sitting in amazon 's warehouse in the heat all summer br br as i expected , about half of these k cups burst open while brewing \( this is not usual , and i 've tried many different brands \) this made them leak \( so clean up was kind of annoying \) and not taste as fresh , but it still tasted decent bottom line when k cups are discounted from amazon warehouse , be ready to pay in other ways ! lol . 
this coffee is good and has nice subtle flavor i am disappointed though because i looked at the bottom and it says decaf i dunno bout you but i drink coffee for the caffeine in the picture on bottom of box has text but it is so small i did not even consider looking on it so just disappointed that is decaf and does not say on page when ordering . 
love the wolfgang puck restaurants , cookware , brand endorsed products , all his brand products cuisine are amazing , i am a loyal fan , yet this creme caramel coffee is tasteless , no real coffee flavor , no hint of caramel or creme , it brews like a bit of steamed milk , that somewhat pasty tasteless feel on your palate soooo dissapointed as i am such a loyal fan of all his brand , products sadly , a waste of funds , did not return because i think food items are none refundable . 
did n't realize it was flavored and thought , when i had my first sip , that it tasted like chemicals f gave it away the next day at work . 
good , but the green mountain reserve sumatra is better by 1 1 and a half stars sort of tastes a little stale . 
i love the names wolfgang puck gives to their coffees , but the coffee descriptions leave a lot to be desired br br in this case , with breakfast in bed , i expected a much more flavorful cup of coffee than delivered breakfast in bed is on the light side of the medium roasts and has a mild , but not very memorable flavor on the plus side , it is a smooth coffee and not acidic at all br br a better choice , in my opinion , is a href http www amazon com gp product b001chfudc coffee people donut shop medium roast , extra bold for keurig brewers , 24 count k cups \( pack of 2 \) a , which also comes in the 50 pack br br added another nice , smooth medium blend is a href http www amazon com gp product b002apwq0k timothy 's world coffee , kona blend for keurig brewers , medium , 50 count k cups a br br added for those who prefer a lighter smooth blend , try a href http www amazon com gp product b00196qvpm keurig green mountain coffee roasters 80 k cup colombian fair trade slect medium roast coffee a \( link for product description only , not for best pricing \) . 
one reviewer mentioned that this coffee was decaff and said it was listed as such on the bottom of the box \( in small print \) i checked my current box and saw no such labeling information however , the new boxes i received are a different color , with a slapped on label for hawaiian hazelnut and now the bottom of the box says it 's made from 100 decaff coffee while i like the flavor , i do not want decaff in the morning , which is when i drink coffee br br unfortunately , i am unable to return this item to amazon because of their return policy , which is why i'm writing this review , to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now i would give more stars for flavor , but the lack of official notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if i tossed my money out the window , buying something i would not have otherwise ordered . 
this flavor is horrible there are many other flavors much better hawaiian hazelnut is great ! breakfast in bed is awesome ! . 
i love my keurig coffee maker and i enjoy experimenting with new coffee flavours a href http www amazon com gp product b003vxhgdm wolfgang puck coffee , creme caramel , 24 count k cups for keurig brewers \( pack of 2 \) a seemed to be a safe choice i love coffee with cream i love caramel i even like wolfgang puck but his creme caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment it 's not awful it just lacks a certain depth of flavour even using the 'small cup' setting , the aroma is very nice , but the taste is a bit watery 'black' , the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste , but it did n't add any of the caramel creaminess i was expecting in short the coffee taste is very mild , and the caramel taste is n't all that great sorry wolfgang , but i'm afraid this one is a yawner . 
i like dark strong coffee but i just did n't really care for this one not sure what it really was , almost a tad bitter \? unfortunately i have another whole box of 24 to use up i picked up some sumatran reserve \( also a dark \) and prefer it . 
if you like your flavored coffee to taste like coffee , this may not be for you i could n't taste the coffee at all in the travel size brew , but the smaller brew sizes were a bit better . 
i got this coffee as part of a bold sampler pack while i found it flavorful i would n't call it bold my first wp k cup was french roast which i found extremely bitter this coffee does n't have that problem br br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano br br my favorite k cups are br starbucks french roast br starbucks caffe verona br starbucks pike place roast br green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve br green mountain double black diamond br green mountain revv br green mountain dark magic br br other k cups i 've tried coffee people jet fuel , green mountain dark magic decaf , emeril jazzed up decaf , starbucks caffe verona , coffee people black tiger , starbucks house blend , starbucks breakfast blend , starbucks sumatra , wolfgang puck french roast , green mountain lake and lodge , green mountain french roast , caribou mahogony , wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya , emeril big easy bold . 
if you like to taste the flavor in your flavored coffee , skip this one i 've struggled to taste the creme caramel flavoring that is supposed to be in here the coffee flavor is also slightly bitter , but that could just be my taste buds longing for some flavoring ! i 'd recommend green mountain , gloria jeans or van houtte brands before this one . 
i love my keurig but have n't found my perfect cup of coffee yet , although this comes close i prefer a medium brew , not bold or strong breakfast in bed is my choice so far . 
jamaica me crazy is a sweet , coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste it is not a bold blend , but rather a mild to medium blend that leans more mild br br this is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends i would consider it a second cup of morning coffee , afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee br br flavor is ok i would like it better if the aftertaste did n't linger for a flavored coffee , it is n't bad if you are a coconut fan , it is a blend to try on for size . 
vanilla flavor is barely noticeable acidic taste , not at all what i expected breakfast in bed and hawaiian hazelnut are much better choices . 
i recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at bed bath and beyond as its brewing , it smells great \( if you like coconut \) the taste is n't bad , but for me , it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have i gave it 3 stars because it 's not terrible but i would n't buy this coffee again if you 're sensitive to after taste , i would n't recommend i 'd grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee . 
i tried this coffee , even though it was significantly more expensive than the green mountain \( organic , free trade \) sumatra that i have been using for some time wolfgang puck has the name and the rep br br if this were the only sumatra dark roast on the market , i 'd be really happy with it this is good coffee br br it is not outstanding coffee compared to folgers , this product is awesome unfortunately for mr puck , i am comparing it to green mountain sumatra br br the organic and free trade sumatra from green mountain is better to my taste , and it is cheaper mornings are good . 
the coffee is good , however the k cup is not packaged well , the coffee machine barely streams coffee , more of a fast drip the whole idea is it 's fast , right \? . 
my hair dresser 's salon bought a keurig machine , so i have been able to sample a variety of k cups k cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so i have never considered buying one for myself , but having a keurig machine at a hair salon makes sense ! people have a variety of tastes and k cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that br br the salon has a nice variety of k cups folders , wolfgang puck , timothy 's , and green mountain \( that owns keurig \) br br everyone 's taste vary , but here is my assessment of the ones that i have tried so far wolfgang puck was my second favorite so far , i like folgers the best br br folgers gourmet br selections lively colombian br price per cup 69 cents \( package of 36 for 25 \) br earthy flavor , fruity and nutty flavors come through br br wolfgang puck chefs reserve colombian dark roast br price per cup 69 cents \( package of 48 for 32 98 \) br a dark roast with caramel and earthy notes , slight burnt br and papery flavors br br timothy's decaffeinated colombian medium br price per cup 60 cents \( package of 50 for 30 \) br a bit on the weak side , kind of papery , and less astringent than the others br br ali julia review . 
while good quality , it was not at all what i expected it smelled like caramel and vanilla , but it tasted like straight black coffee i was pretty disappointed . 
the coffee is just ok , a little weak the price is a little high and it is not worth the extra money . 
i was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is it has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak . 
taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before i mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning small print on the bottom of the box \( i mean 6 point font \) tells this several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine i do n't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale . 
too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase it 's not bold or dark enough to stand up to the keurig 's 3rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking . 
i personally did not care for the coffee , too mild for me and a little nutty flavor in it i will stick with tully 's kona and house blends , also emeril 's big easy bold . 
more than a hint of coconut ! not very much vanilla being a vanilla fan and not a coconut fan this is ok . 
this coffee is a lot like the green mountain nantucket blend if you like that , you 'll like this generally , the gm product costs less , but this was on sale . 
probably because it does n't taste like coffee it is flavorless i saw the good reviews and thought i 'd get a couple boxes and now i'm stuck with a bunch of k cups that i do n't want to drink because i 'd rather literally drink any other k cup i 've ever tried as you can see i'm not a fan of these k cups these are the worst ever . 
i will drink this if all other coffee options are exhausted the coffee has a vanilla coconut smell but after a sip or two , i ca n't drink it would not purchase again and i'm having trouble even giving it away i expected more from wolfgang puck . 
i love caramel and was excited when this arrived but i am so disappointed hardly any flavor at all , of coffee or caramel .

or the good reviewers' taste buds are weak this is some disappointingly br weak coffee i'm not some crazy gotta have my jet black sludge to get br through the day coffee drinker i 'd say my favorite \( and my wife 's \) is br caribou blend this blend is weak , it ca n't hold half and half or even br just whole milk without being wiped out now , i will say i brew it on br the large cup \( 9 25 oz , i believe \) setting on our keurig , so maybe it 's br a bit better on the 8oz setting , or even the small setting but caribou \( we br also like donut shop , green mountain kona blend 10 , etc \) can be easily br brewed on 9 25 and hold a good bold taste this coffee does n't br hold a candle to any of those now i'm stuck with 40 of these blech maybe br the guests wo n't mind it ! \) . 
i really love this coffee , great tasting and bold however , on about 1 3rd of the pods , the foil separates from the cup and blows grounds into the brewer and my coffee cup i can usually predict which ones will do it because the foil on the k cup is not puffy like it has pressure , but flat and wrinkled . 
it 's coconut flavored , either you 'll like it or not i was actually surprised since i'm not a big fan of coconut , but i liked this coffee not my favorite , but nice on occasion . 
i love the taste but have found that many of the cups explode ! ! the glue on the side of the cup becomes undone and then the cup explodes very hard to clean up do not think i will buy this brand again ! . 
this is less of a bold flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee my wife is easy to please and she 's not a fan i 'll finish the box but i reach of others first . 
the coffee is just ok it 's very mild , almost bordering on weak would buy it again if the price was right . 
bought this on the recommendation of my son not a big fan of flavored coffee , but a cup a day of this lightly flavored coconut coffee puts me in the islands how can you go wrong with wolfgang puck \? . 
this coffee says dark roast extra bold and it isn't ! it 's weak and barely beats out a cup of folgers . 
the flavor of this coffee is good , it has a nice balance of vanilla without being too strong it 's not the boldest coffee , but it 's a nice afternoon treat br br that being said , i have had problems with several pods when you hold them up to the light , you can see that there are grounds outside of the filter portion of the pod this causes a cup full of grounds when you brew the coffee , and also clogs up the pin at the bottom of the pod chamber i 'd say about 1 out of every 5 or 6 pods has this problem . 
i love the taste of this coffee but in my last order of four boxes about every other k cup has a tear or rip in the internal filter and thus the grounds flow through into the cup of coffee which wastes the value of the coffee as drinkable wolfgang needs to correct this flaw in packaging i will not order again because of the waste . 
i admit , i like my french vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side this is n't it 's a much stronger coffee brew , meaning more sugar and creamer is needed to tone down the coffee flavor on the other hand , it 's a reasonable alternative if my preferred brand \( van houtte \) is n't on sale or when it 's occasionally out of stock i like that it comes in a 2 pack because our family goes through a lot of k cups and i do n't have to order quite so often . 
10 years ago my daughter brought home creme' brulee' for the first time it was perfect , beans to be ground since then i have searched for anything similar when i realized i could n't find it , she had forgotten what one she purchased br br this one has a strong flavor , but it tastes fake with a strong after taste unfortunately it is one of the better ones if anyone reads this and knows what ones \( carmel and vanilla \) , taste great , please post here . 
i really like the taste of this coffee ! my only complaint is that the coffee grinds end up in my coffee not a huge fan of that and even though i really like the taste of it i will not order again , bummer ! ! \( . 
i thought the coffee tasted fine it was not strong enough for my husband several of the pods burst during brewing i probably wo n't purchase this again . 
i bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite \( jet fuel or emeril 's big intense bold \) liked this one typically sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well br br i am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label br it is not bold it is extremely mild and smoky tasting not a single member of my family liked it and that 's very unusual br br i'm going to contact the company to see if they 'll exchange it or refund me it is that bad . 
as coffee in general , this wolfgang variety was alright however , i was expecting a creme caramel taste , or something similar , and i do n't feel this delivered i tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just did n't do it for me it is marketed as a flavored coffee , yet i could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee . 
this is a good french roast coffee , although it could be a little bolder i 've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup it 's extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess . 
i got this is a low cost alternative to my normal jet fuel and it just did n't measure up i like strong coffee but this had a bitter taste that i just did n't care for also , 3 of the cups had some sort of malfunction and dumped their grinds into my cup not sure why . 
this coffee is not a true medium roast like caribou french roast , donut house , etc there was not much coffee flavor at all i found it to be so weak in flavor that not only did i have to go down a brew size , but i also have to add less milk just too drink it i will never buy it again wish i did n't have 45 more cups to go thru ! . 
i ordered wolf gang puck 's k cups , largely because of his reputation and my experiences at his restaurants , both of which are good however , when i drank my first cup of the breakfast blend , i tasted no coffee it was as if i was drinking hot water i was very disappointed and will purchase only those k cups which i know to be good sorry wolf gang , this is a sleeper ! . 
i was expecting a mellow caramel flavor , but this coffee is a bit sharp and you really ca n't make out any carmel flavor . 
i am only drinking it , so it wo n't be wasted , and i have to rotate it with a coffee people product , so i remember why i like coffee it is really wan the strongest flavor profile is tin i love creme caramel and am a huge wp fan , but the flavor strenth and consistancy of this coffee does not impress choose another you wo n't be sorry you did . 
my favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like french , italian , and full city this k cup dark roast has a big , bold flavor , but lacks balance the level of smokiness , bitterness , and acid are way too high , and the result is not enjoyable i liked the dark roasts for the keurig from green mt , newman , and donut shop much more than this one . 
i love wolfgang puck products but the coffee is very disappointing br there is a weak flavor almost tastes diluted ! br some troll must have changed out all the real puck products ! br libbie . 
this is the 1st k cup coffee that i am getting grounds in my coffee it is occuring about every 3 cups i have not had this problem with other k cup manufactures i will not reorder . 
i bought a 24 pack of this an drank almost all of them before realizing what the flavor reminded me of it tastes like hotdog water . 
it seems the flavor selection on amazon has been limited these days to some variation of hazelnut , french vanilla or chocolate so when i saw this one , i thought i 'd give it a try never having had wolfgang puck 's k cups , i was hoping they 'd be as good as the wolfgang puck coffee i 've had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas , i was mistaken i would n't say it 's the worst i 've had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too i feel like i'm drinking coffee that 's been made with grounds that have already been perked in other words the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and i'm getting leftovers br br if you 're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that does n't really taste like much of anything , this is your pod if you 're looking for better , richer flavors , stick with green mountain which sadly amazon does n't seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge 60 for a box ! . 
i tried a double boxes of this when the donut shop coffee i usually order was unavailable while the coffee is pretty good the cups suck a full 1 3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable they are slow to brew \( coffee maker has to work very hard \) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed they could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee i believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable . 
i like bold coffees and should have trusted the other reviewer who said it was n't strong enough this one has a watery finish to it and not very much flavor i 'll be going back to emeril 's jazz 'd up decaf and trying the coffee people 's french roast decaf so far i 've loved everything by the coffee people except the organic blend if you like strong coffee do n't buy this but if you like a weaker coffee that you can see through you 'd probably enjoy this one . 
i love this coffee ! i am not a strong coffee drinker and this coffee is perfect ! i have no problems with it working in my cuisinart keurig brewer , i aways get the perfect tasting cup of coffee br br i gave it 3 stars because one of the 2 packs contained only 13 k cups and not the 24 that it was supposed to have br br the decaf 24 count \( pack of 2 \) arrived with the correct amount of k cups and is as yummy as the high test ! . 
this was the nastiest flavored coffee i have ever had in kcups i purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag it smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what i expected i will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees this was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last i order of his brand i thought maybe i got a bad cup but i brewed 3 and i opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness . 
i thought it had a bitter orange flavor , however my husband and friend liked it . 
we have tried just about every k cup of regular coffee out there we do n't do the flavor kind my husband loves the gm brand most of the coffees are mild \( even when they say medium roast \) i go for a little more on the medium roast like the some of the tully 's and caribou brands it used to be that we were always ordering the same brands , once we liked a certain one but i ventured to try the wolfgang puck line while this flavor is touted as a medium roast , it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness it is still not a bad coffee , just not as good as the rodeo drive or breakfast in bed k cups which has no bitterness i must say though , we have now added the latter 2 flavors of wolfgang to our buying ritual . 
my husband likes strong coffee i like medium neither one of us like this particular one there just is n't much flavor of any kind coffee or caramel we like the vanilla one much better we 'll drink this until it 's gone but it 's the last flavor we choose , and it 's lasting way too long ! . 
the taste is fine , but the k cup container has opened at the seal during the brewing process on more than one occasion , resulting in a mouthful of coffee grounds ! i have never had this happen with any other brand of k cup before and hope it is not the norm for wolfgang puck . 
i prefer the extra bold coffees , so this one really lacking on the flavor it 's fairly weak , at the smallest cup setting its drinkable , but i wo n't be buying it again i 'd recommend the timothy 's world coffee , rainforest decaf espresso instead . 
taste is okay not blown away hidden is the fact that this is truly a decaffeinated coffee only place to find this out is on the bottom of the box not what i want first thing in the morning . 
i am not a fan of flavored coffee and i thought i had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did i see any indication that it was a flavored coffee i wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is jamaican coffee . 
i use to purchase jamaica beans locally and it was great this jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it the odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale other people in household tried it and could n't get past the first cup pitched the remainder cups in the trash . 
this coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong , but i have to say it almost ruined my months' old keurig personal brewer the coffee is ground so finely that when the k cups are punctured by the needles \( top and bottom \) , it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles , going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty sludge in the bottom of each cup i purchased a pack of 2 \( 48 k cups \) and did n't even use one full pack i do not recommend this brand or blend it is a waste of money , which is something i could n't really afford at this time i sent a letter of complaint to the wolfgang puck company and , except for a cookie cutter letter acknowledging receipt of my comment , i have not received any further contact from them . 
unfortunately , i'm much too frugal to throw away something i 've spent perfectly good money on , so i'm continuing to use these suckers until they 're gone \( hopefully in a few weeks \) i thought i was buying a decent brand of coffee , given the wolfgang puck name , but alas , i was wrong using the middle cup size on my keurig coffeemaker , these k cups make a weak cup of coffee more like brown water no taste , no nothing i switched to the smallest size cup and it 's marginally better , but still barely drinkable i would n't serve these to guests ever i ca n't wait to be done with these boxes of junk so i can order something with some taste please do n't waste your money . 
this was terrible coffee wolfgang pucks jamaicamecrazy , i received a partial refund but felt i should have gotten a full refund as i ca n't drink the coffee and had to throw it all away also had to pay shipping and should not of had to i would like a response to this . 
the aroma is pleasant , and flavor is nice and smooth , but it is very , very weak i really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save , but i just cannot recommend it even making smaller cups it is very weak i'm going to stick to newman 's own organics extra bold as my go to k cup for now . 
i had tried green mountain sumatra reserve and found it delicious and strong it 's not available on subscribe and save so i read the reviews and opted for wolfgang puck my husband likes it and i like the flavour but it 's very weak in comparison to the green mountain i have to order something else for me . 
we love hazelnut coffee , but this just did n't have enough coffee flavor in it for me kind of on the weak side in my opinion i 'll keep looking . 
i admit , i am not terribly fond of flavored coffees but , this one is not for us we both love the rodeo drive i have a good freind that loves this coffee i sent her ours . 
i found this coffee to be great at first , but as i started having it more and more i came to detest it on the large setting the coffee is way too watery also , the flavor is very , very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas br br it is a pretty good mid afternoon or evening desert coffee , but other than that it is kinda gross . 
i am definitely not a coffee connoisseur , but this stuff is bad it is a disappointment because i expected a wolfgang puck product to have more class this tastes artificial and it ca n't stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener will not buy again ! . 
really \? who blends this stuff and decides that it is good \? ugh i can sum this nastyness up in one quick phrase stale airline coffee ! if you like that flavor , then you will love this one , if you do n't like thin cardboard soaked , never washed the pot out , and the water came from a tin canteen , flavored coffee , then you wo n't like this one either ! i would give this zero stars if i could wow , likely the worst cup of coffee that i have ever had i hope wolfy reads this as his name is on the package and i expected more , now i know not to buy any of his signature products , awesome , thanks for saving me next time ! the package says extra bold , but it does n't taste extra bold it 's almost like they put some ground instant powder in the mix to make it stronger . 
the coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt i cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt will not order this again . 
i'm amazed that people are happy with this product i'm not a drinker of the dark brews , french roast or anything , but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee , this is completely tasteless the initial scent is delicious , too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee . 
i got this through a decaf keurig assortment pack \( also from amazon \) and while i have enjoyed all of the flavors thisone was so weak i had to post a review . 
to me this coffee was extremely bitter i dumped it out and made a different cup it made me afraid to try other wp coffees but i did like the wp sumatra kopi raya br br for reference purposes my in store drink is a starbucks americano br br my favorite k cups are br starbucks french roast br starbucks caffe verona br starbucks pike place roast br green mountain xtra bold sumatran reserve br green mountain double black diamond br green mountain revv br green mountain dark magic br br other k cups i 've tried coffee people jet fuel , green mountain dark magic decaf , emeril jazzed up decaf , starbucks caffe verona , coffee people black tiger , starbucks house blend , starbucks breakfast blend , starbucks sumatra , wolfgang puck french roast , green mountain lake and lodge , green mountain french roast , caribou mahogony , wolfgang puck sumatra kopi raya , emeril big easy bold . 
coffee is a very subjective thing some people like coffee that borders on tea , others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous battlestar galactica pilot serves for the record , i love the slightly sour taste of dunkin donuts coffee and i find the stuff made by that other chain to be akin to re hydrated cigarette ash for many years , we still percolated coffee with most big name brands of pre ground coffee , you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it , but again , your tastes may vary br br with my keurig , my favorite coffee was paul neumans extra bold because it did n't seem extra bold until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor then , my favorites were the caribu 's but something happened to that brand \( see reviews \) and i agree , they did something either they do n't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend , the sourcing of the beans , etc wasted money on caribu and wont go back to the brand br br so wolfgang puck got the nod , tried 4 different flavors this one , sorrento , is not my favorite of the bunch \( currently colombian chef 's reserve \) it has a bolder strength \( which i believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider medium \) , but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it cream and sweetener do n't correct for this , and thus i'm a bit disappointed but again it was a stab in the dark br br i think if you prefer a slightly bolder , slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee this may be for you i like the character of the colombian chef 's reserve , but it is not as strong , and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards i do n't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the wolfgang puck line however ca n't say the same for some other k cup brands . 
this wolfgang puck coffee jamaica me crazy is the worst coffee i 've ever had ! br i threw it out right away after one sip ! it taste like all coconut flavoring br hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable they should be fired ! . 
ugh no where on the amazon page for this item did it state that it was hazelnut flavored i have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it thought it was going to be a blue mountain like jamaican coffee . 
this coffee is only mediocre in quality i do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do i like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date the only reason i am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that i paid very little for it by using a credit i had at amazon payments i do not recommend this coffee . 
if keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular k cup , keurig would be out of business wolfgang puck french roast melange francais is inexcusably terrible coffee aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old kwiki mart carafe mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating the after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth i simply could n't believe my keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee , so i tried again a week later with same results i use average to good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like green mountain , tulleys , nor emeril 's everyone i know that has a keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup usually the results are stunning , and the keurig invasion lives on when i share i 'll stick with offering the coffee peoples' black tiger or jet fuel now i have 22 more wp fr k cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of let me know if you want them , as i 'd be embarrassed to even give them away sorry wolfgang , but what the puck your french roast is unpardonably horrible , and at k cup prices i 'll not be duped again i 'll stay away from any of the other wp offerings . 
this stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells my son did n't like it either and i ended up throwing it out . 
ok today 4 15 this company decided to put them up for sale at 12 50 per 24pk this advertisement was on slickdeals net br br well went to order and refreshed the page and in my cart was now 1 at 36 dollars \? \? \? \? so they sold one out of my cart br next i waited 20 mins to see if it was a fluke and sd net started claiming dead link br br well upon refreshing again they were now 44 95 for one 24 pack br br hey ridiculous seller get with the program if this is your way of recovering quick money i think people are much smarter then that upon pressing confirm my order round of applause to you for being so un tech savy . 
no thanks kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard organic bold and donut shop are still our faves . 
the worst ! ! ! it is just plan awful bitter and strong and you cannot taste the hazel nut flavor at all ! ! ! ! ! do not buy this product save your money ! ! ! ! ! . 
k cups are marginally better than good coffee that i can buy at the store for 1 2 the price or less this product was offered at 19 95 and i was willing to purchase it but it immediately went up to 26 95 it is not really worth 19 95 and is certainly not worth any increase additionally , what 's the deal on offering instant coffee in k cups for 15 99 leaving us to think it 's a good deal on real coffee do you want to lose our trust \( business \) \? \? \? \? that 's a good way to do it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! br jb . 
i thought this coffee was really horrible had one cup and will throw the rest away because it ca n't be returned . 
i ordered the vanilla coffee for my college age children unfortunately , there were shipping delays and it did not arrive until the kids had returned to college for the fall semester update to come when they finally come home for a break it may be a while the other coffees i have ordered have all been tasty and a very good value , i have no reason to believe this will be any different i can say that the k cups and the keurig have been delightful i enjoy having a freshly brewed cup every time and like that i save a bunch of money by brewing at home into a travel mug rather than stopping to drop 2 00 for a cup on the way to work saves all those styrofoam cups too ! . 
i bought both the creme caramel and this hazelnut kcup and i could n't tell them apart even if my life depended on it the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too and unlike the caramel one , this one has a nasty bitter aftertaste like the flavor is artificial yeah , i know it 's artificial but i hate that it actually tastes like a chemical ! yuk br br this is one of those coffees you can serve to company who does n't know good coffee or people you do n't want to have come to your house any more as one cup of this and they wo n't be your friends after it ! it really is quite bad . 
this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of 6 people there are 6 people in my shop we all hate it not good . 
i was so excited to try a new bold coffee needless to say , i am disappointed i would rate this coffee as a medium if it would have been listed as a medium , i would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a medium strength coffee in taste and flavor i will still drink it from time to time flavor is smooth , not bitter overall , i wish that i would have ordered some more jet fuel or black tiger . 
so here is another example of a 48 pack of k cups i bought untested i figured , well , i really enjoy sumatra 's bold , smooth and rich with a bit of bitterness flaver , so why not \? wolfgang puck has a few restaurants , so maybe he knows coffee br br so , this is utterly average in all departments it 's not very bold or rich , although i can say it does have the bitterness , which is a bit unbalanced as it lacks the richness purchased only because it appeared on the subscribe save at a great price per k cup that makes two wp 's that have been run of the mill at best sumatra french roast next time i 'll be more discerning . 
i really like to mix things up with k cups and rarely buy 50 ct boxes of a single flavor exception to the rule would be for dark , bold coffees such as french roasts , which i really enjoy so when wolfgang puck 's french roast turned up on amazon 's deal of the week , even though i have never tried before , now i have 48 units br br it 's fairly non descript for a french roast decent aroma , but taste is muted compared to , for example , a diedrich french roast i do n't hate or even dislike it , it 's 'okay' , and for the price i paid , is acceptable without complaint it may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich br br i 'd call it mildly bold , average , and i wo n't be going out of my way to keep it on hand . 
wolfgang puck 's breakfast in bed is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one . 
this is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe it 's artificially flavored , and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it my household hated it of course , that would be my problem if the description was accurate , but it 's not amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page . 
first , let me say that i prefer extra bold k cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend , and never decaf i bought three wolfgang puck coffees several months ago rodeo drive blend french roast and sumatra kopi raya all three are quite drinkable , though they do not measure up to a few of the extra bold blends from coffee people kona blend organic blend jet fuel and black tiger even better than these , though , is my new favorite , a href http www amazon com gp product b003m7ttyg green mountain 's revv a those who prefer a strong , dark cup of coffee \( even at the larger mug setting \) should try that brand br br previously , i had found the dark roast green mountain coffees rather boring , but revv lives up to the hype , both in strength and flavor another great green mountain coffee is their espresso blend \( though amazon does n't stock it , so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick and mortar stores such as bed bath and beyond \) finally , a favorite regular over the years has been a href http www amazon com gp product b004m5w7yq emeril 's big easy bold a it 's a very nice coffee , though do n't expect the new orleans experience of chicory flavor br br bottom line you wo n't go wrong with the wolfgang puck coffees , but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees . 
of all the k cup flavors that are out there , and there are many very good ones , this is one of my least favorites , and i have tried almost all of them not much flavor to this one , even if you add various types of creamers of course , it is all a matter of taste , but this one does n't taste all that good it is not bad it is just kind of there like a generic coffee try something else instead . 
the coffee was more on the light side rather than medium roast i do n't think i would purchase it again even though it was a good value purchase . 
as coffee , these kcups are just ok as flavored coffee these are disappointing i found the vanilla to be barely detectable . 
after receiving this coffee i made a few cups it was fairly smooth , not too overpowering , and had a slight mocha aroma it 's ok coffee i likely will not purchase this one again because there are so many better ones to gauge my review for others , my favorites are coffee people donut shop , green mountain dark magic , coffee people organic bold , emeril 's big easy bold , and tully 's kona blend . 
i really like medium strength coffee but this is a little too bold to be considered medium it is almost bitter when compared to other medium coffees . 
this coffee is okay but certainly not as good as green mountain 's breakfast blend it just does n't taste as good . 
this is a great flavored coffee nevertheless , k cups are getting too expensive for everyday home use i am now using the filler and using my own ground coffee much of the time it 's also helpful to look for other price alternatives . 
i purchased two of these and they arrived with the package split and the items all over the box i contacted amazon and they sent two more out , these also arrived with the packages open amazon was very courteous and professional as always , i cannot review the item itself because the packaging is so horrible that i have given up on trying again . 
sorry , as i stated on my other reviews my german breed , g sheph is very picky and he just did not care for the smell of these beef rolls , he did not even care to come close to take 2nd sniff sorry , no star ! ! ! but it triggered me to give it as least 1 star to continue my review . 
licorice has no flavor very hard to eat it was in a seal bag but it hard not soft like other licorice . 
i like the senseo coffee machine and believe that it can make very good coffee however , i have been disappointed with the senseo coffee pods that are made in belgium by douwe egberts the pods are not individually wrapped and the coffee often does not taste fresh the pods also contain too little coffee which results in a weak , watery brew the flavored senseo french vanilla caramel bistro coffee pods seem to me to be better than most senseo blends that i have tried in general , i prefer to buy pods from timothy 's world coffee the timothy pods contain almost twice as much coffee as the senseo pods and the resulting coffee is superior , in my view i have found that the timothy pods will work well in the senseo machine if the pod is moistened and smoothed before latching the lid i use the single pod holder and make a 4 ounce cup if you must use the senseo pods made by douwe egberts , try this blend . 
these pods are rather bland i purchased them because i thought they would make a nice dessert coffee they do not taste much different than regular coffee pods i would not purchase them again , nor do i recommend them . 
this batch was horrible since most regular coffee were out of stock , i tried this one it tastes and smells awful do not buy this flavor . 
although it sounded delicious , i was very disappointed in this coffee the coffee has a strange , chemical aftertaste cup after cup , not just once even when it brews , it creates a chemical sort of aroma in fact , because our single serve pod coffee brewer was new , i started thinking the problem was the brewer we assumed it was a left over manufacturing plastic or metal aftertaste coming through in the water i even e mailed the coffee machine maker \( bunn \) to see how to remove the aftertaste imagine our surprise when a month later we opened a new pack of pods \( regular colombian , not flavored \) and were delighted that our machine makes great coffee when we made a cup of the senseo vanilla again back came the off taste and aroma perhaps it 's the artificial flavors used \? be forewarned ! . 
the particular packages had an off taste however , the seller gave me a complete refund and did n't even make me send them back i have ordered this item before and they were fine . 
we have been purchasing this product for several months and have enjoyed it in the past , but this order is inferior did the company change hands or outsource their production \? . 
hi , coffee does n't smell or taste great i recommend senseo vienna still have packages of paris and nobody wanna drink it guess i just have to throw it away . 
they kept raising the price the product was great and remained the same but they kept raising the price this last order i have had enough and will be going back ! . 
if this was called medium roast , i would give it 4 stars it 's a good coffee br br but this is called french vanilla caramel , and this review is based on the product 's name br br let me say that vanilla and caramel are perhaps my favorite flavors coffee , ice cream , candy , you name it if it 's vanilla or caramel , i love it br br with the exception of this br br where 's the vanilla \? where 's the caramel \? and do n't get me wrong i'm not trying to say that the flavors are too mild i'm saying that they are non existent and therefore , based on the name , this coffee gets 1 star . 
this jam has little fruit taste if you love damson jam this is not the one for you it could have been any flavor all you taste is sweetness . 
after a few uses , this powder spoilt a cake it has lost its raising power it is still well within the expiry date and the container has been kept closed and in a dry place avoid this one i plan to ask for a refund . 
i opened the box to find a huge mess of chocolate all over the tray chocolate was no better than hershey 's and worst of all , it is imported from hong kong i do n't care to eat food made in china after all their countless product safety issues look elsewhere . 
this is the first review i have ever done , but i could not let this one go bye this was the worst ever , save your money . 
there is not much one can say about hawaiian punch my kids love it the only r eason i took off 2 stars is that i ordered 8 64 oz bottles and received 4 128 oz bottles i need the smaller bottles so my kids can pour on their own i will have to revert to going to the supermarket for future hawaiian punch needs . 
i think i'm not a green tea drinker this is pretty awful tasting stuff glad i bought just one bag , because i'm throwing it out . 
this huge bag of chocolates contained old \( white and cracked \) chocolates that were completely melted all over the inside of the bag ! noone at work would even touch them since they looked so sad and gross what a waste and disappointment ! will be wary to ever purchase from this seller again . 
if you are looking for a sugar high , then these are what you are looking for too sweet for me and my family , i do n't think we will be ordering these again . 
if you buy this from amazon , you 'll be disappointed at the shipping my box of 12 came in one cardboard box , with the 12 container boxes loosely in a plastic bag one was smashed , so leaking into the bag , two were dented , and one was coming open from the bottom due to the puddle of leaking water in the bag i opened the bag , and it smelled awful from the rancid , leaking water if amazon wants to continue selling the 12 pack 33oz , it needs to package the shipping better note , however , i was able to live chat with amazon and get a refund , even though the item is a non returnable grocery item br and , review of the drink the drink itself is superior to the taste of vita coca \( good \) or zico \( too sweet \) , so as a drink , the o n e , really is like drinking from a real coconut out in the tropics i am going back to the individual single serve containers of o n e , shipped from amazon br and , in a second comparison , the multi pack of vita coca 33oz comes superbly packaged in the shipping box from amazon \( as each 33oz container is invidually protected in a cardboard sleeve \) br hope that helps \( and , thank you amazon for letting me have a refund on the damaged box , but it will be more helpful if you can protect the boxes better for shipping it to us \) . 
my wife really loves o n e coconut water i thought via auto ship would be a great way not to have to go to the store every other day to get some i ordered 6 cases of 12 ea the first problem occurred when case number one was sent back as undeliverable i guess a san diego address would be undeliverable in kentucky of the 5 remaining cases all of which did arrive but in not great condition all the cases were still sealed but 1 had 2 of the 33 8 ounce boxes split open and there were 3 other boxes in other cases that were stale \( really had a rancid smell \) therefore i cancelled the auto ship and have gone back to picking this up in the local supermarket works out better , just more time consuming and heavier it would have been nice knowing that the cases were in fact pretty flimsy my wife still loves the product . 
first off , i did n't purchase this product through amazon , but at a local grocery store , so my review only reflects the product itself , not amazon in any way i bought this last week never having tried coconut water before , but i heard good things the taste of it was almost like the smell of lawn clippings that had been damp and out in the sun for a long time tasted off and had a faint mold smell to it i did n't know if it was supposed to taste like that or not as i never tried it before , but paying as much as i did i felt obligated to finish it off i 've been ill for about a week after drinking it i do n't know if it was just a coincidence or the cause of it i did email customer service at o n e the day i drank it asking if it was supposed to taste like that or if i got a bad batch , and they still have n't replied to me . 
i love the coconut water light and refreshing , packed with potassium i was guzzling it down like , well , water , daily i do n't really enjoy plain water a lot of the time , but this provided refreshment , hydration , and flavor without a lot of the junk and or calories that other drinks come with 5 stars br br i was looking forward to continuing buying it and consuming it regularly with subscribe and save however br br price , specifically change in price , is terrible 1 star i cannot say more . 
people watch out if you are buying this product online i 've ordered 12 bottles of the o n e , i was expecting this to be same as what i bought from store but this seller disappointed me , the bottles have the seal broken and the taste of the coconut water is not what i expected , i'm sure that this seller the person who packaged the bottles added water by breaking the seal i 've wasted my money on this product , i 'll never buy this online for a few bucks cheap rather than go to the nearby store and buy it br br my rating for this product is 0 5 br br in short , seal broken , diluted and not comparable with the one that i bought from store . 
hi , br i am very disappointed with the past shipment i received of the one coconut water 3 of the boxes were leaking and the coconut water was spoiled br br thanks br br laks . 
i bought these for my vegan father who loves the curry kale chips by rhythm superfoods \( my 22 month old daughter , husband and i also like them \) ! br br thought i would give him a new kale chip flavor bbq as part of his christmas gift although a different brand than we typically eat , they sounded good first , i was disappointed to see these chips are not kale in its natural curly form but pressed into round , dog snack looking discs luckily i tried them before giving them i spit it right out ! was it just me \? my husband also tried one and could n't finish even one chip br br i have a pack of 4 that cannot be returned what a waste of food and money ! . 
every time i heated this particular soup in any microwave , the container made a popping sound and popped up off the turning tray , fell over , and spilled out if you can catch it before it spills over completely , you will find when eating that the noodles all gravitate to the bottom and you are left with a very untasty , pasty noodle mash at the end of the serving . 
love this stuff , very easy to work with and reasonably priced if you can manage to buy it through amazon with thier subscribe and save program , otherwise it is pretty expensive and you are better off making your own mmf the wilton stuff is like rubber and hard to roll out thin enough i had no trouble with this it also was not too sticky which was the problem i ran into when i used the duff product from michaels so far this is the best fondant i have used it really does n't dry out so if you want your pieces to stiffen up quickly or become completely hard you will need to mix in gumtex , tylose or gumpaste to accomplish that i love the taste of this fondant too , i do n't usually like fondant icings but this one is really good ! the white is truely white too , not cream or antique at all so you can easily mix in other colors to tint the color you want br br update 1 6 12 br lowering my stars from 5 to 3 br my first few batches of fondarific were great , easy to work with , good taste , nice consistency etc i use alot of fondant and have pretty much used every brand out there plus made my own i was totally sold on fondarific until my last couple of orders i did n't feel like dying fondant so i purchased the colored fondarific for the first time \( pink and red \) so i'm not sure if that was the problem but they were really soft like another reviewer i ended spending an extra 3 hours or so to cover my cake and decorate it because i had to keep putting the stuff in the freezer and it tore and bubbled all over the place it was ridiculous like working with melting taffy i live in washington state and it was october so humidity was definitely not the problem my last batch of white was workable but also stickier than usual so pieces kept sticking to the mat \( even with cornstarch or shortening \) so far both batches of black that i purchased were great and did n't have these issues i have to agree with other reviewers here that the consistancy is lacking with this product if you get a good batch it is the best stuff out there but you have to cross your fingers and hope luck is with you i may give them one more shot since my first few orders of white were perfect but i will probably also make some marshmellow fondant just in case they are n't up to snuff . 
this product worked well for small cakes it also tasted great for any cakes over 12 inches , it just would pull until their was a hole in it it is almost too soft a product . 
this fondant tastes good but does not work well for decorating cupcakes it 's very soft and the more you mix in color , the softer it becomes i added powdered sugar to help make it not stick to my mat , cookie cutters and tools , but it was a constant battle my major complaint with this fondant is that it does n't harden i made decorations 3 days in advance \( which i 've done in the past using wilton fondant \) and they were n't drying the morning i needed them , they were so soft that even picking them up distorted the shape i ended up having to place a high powered fan in front of them while i went to work for 8 hours , only to come home to semi dry decorations because i have a ton left over , i'm going to try and mix gum paste with it to see if that helps with the stickiness and drying time i do not recommend this product if you 're trying to create flowers , stars or any type of decoration that requires tools and drying time needless to say , i will not be buying this product again . 
i did a lot of research on this fondant and really wanted to like it however it just did n't work for me when it arrived it was hard as a rock , but there is a card inside that indicates about 30 50 seconds in the microwave will make it easier to work with this really did work well it made it much more pliable and easier to work with the fondant took color real well and rolled out nicely it does say no shortening or powdered sugar needed that 's pretty false if you 're coloring it you do need some while needing otherwise it will stick to your hands and your work surface i definitely needed powdered sugar while rolling it out otherwise it stuck to the silicon mat i use also , after coloring and putting it in the microwave it definitely needed some time in the refrigerator before it could be rolled again and placed on the cake otherwise it was far too gooey br br finally , the moment of truth arrived , laying the rolled out fondant on the cake it was much more difficult to work with than i imagined it 's very picky on the thickness too thick it 's impossible to lay flat , too thin and it would stretch and get holes i will say it did get some 'elephant skin' during application i was able to smooth it out using a smoothing tool and the final product looked fine perhaps i was a little bit rusty , i used to teach a wilton cake decorating class and have taught fondant decorating for many years but have n't done a cake in the past 5 6 years i just never remember the wilton brand , which tastes horrible , ever being this hard to work with br br the flavor was fine on it 's own , but as most fondants , it 's incredibly sweet incredibly despite the improved flavor people were still pealing it off the cake and eating the cake and frosting br br in the end the cake looked wonderful and people were pleased but not sure i 'll be using this brand again . 
i have ordered many tubs of fondarific in many colors , and generally do n't have many problems if you are looking for a fondant to sculpt figurines out of , this is not the fondant for you it is , however , the best tasting fondant you will find , guaranteed it does not dry out which is lovely for covering cakes , but is the reason sculpting is impossible br br this last time i ordered a five pound bucket in wedding white , it was horrible it was so soft it was almost gooey i had my ac at 65 degrees , placed it in the freezer for awhile , and it was still stretchy and soft as if i had been kneading it forever i even added some gumpaste and a ton of tylose to try to stiffen it a little , to no avail br br i was in a bind and had no time to get or make more fondant , so my cake took 3 times as long as it would have , and it looked horrible i was very disappointed br br i guess i just got a bad batch this time i would suggest that you order ahead of time and check it first so you do n't get stuck like i did . 
so you know i am serious i would give it a 0 , were it an option i love amazon they have never let me down , so i am hoping they come through for me when i file a claim with them br br the product was rock hard , so i followed the enclosed instructions and heated it even less than the recommended time in the microwave it kneaded easily enough and smelled tasted good when it came to rolling , i could tell immediately that this was going to be a challenge sure enough , it tore all over the place redo i used cornstarch , the way i was taught , and it still stuck to every surface as if it were too warm or wet , yet cracked as if it were too dry nothing made it cooperate , so i lowered my standards and draped it anyway durring the two foot trip from the rolling surface to the cake , it ripped in several places and the application to the cake ended in absolute disaster no , i did not roll it too thin yes , i used cornstarch \( even though the packaging specifically claims it is unnecessary \) it sucks the end . 
this product was so easy to work with on 6 23 12 i made a little over 100 flowers for wedding cupcakes , the following day i did the same using a different color of satin ice the flowers of both fondants were firm , i stored them in an air tight container on 7 2 12 i opened the container of flower made with the fondarific and they were soft the flowers made from satin ice were perfect i left the container of fondarific flowers open over night to see if they would harden up again , they turned out gummy , you know , like chewed gum , which is probably less sticky than this mess i am so dissappointed in this product fortunately i made my flowers early , i have time to purchase satin ice and make 100 more flowers i do not recommend this product . 
i was very dissapointed with this fondant i decided to try it for the first time , and that was a mistake they claim that the fondant can be rolled out thinner then most brands , so you can use less to decorate more that is not true even just rolling it out to 1 8in it tends to tear once i finally got it on the cake to cover , it is very hard to smooth it around the cake it is very sticky , the fondant smoother does not glide smoothly over it all in all i will never buy this brand again , i am going to stick with wilton . 
fondarific usually has glowing reviews everyone on the cake forums seems to love it my batch was either old or just crap very disappointing will go back to making marshmallow fondant cheaper and way easier to work with also bought the black but did n't open it because the white was such crap had to use it because i ran out of time to make mmf for the cake i was making due to the fact that i pre purchased fondant to use br br i love working with fondant , and thought that maybe i 'd use something easier this time , but it was n't good luck with this br br taste however , was quite good . 
my fondarific buttercream wedding white fondant , 5 pounds is as hard as concrete ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i just received this today , i ca n't use it , obviously , i have a wedding on saturday , what should i do \? help ! this a non return item , what should a customer do \? . 
i was excited to see that amazon is selling 100 kopi luwak however , these beans were a huge disappointment because they had no aroma and flavor at all i'm guessing that they sent stale beans because there was no roast date printed on the bag . 
i bought this to take a check mark off of the bucket list , but my wife and i had a cup of this and both of us immediately got sick with a headache and vomiting profusly what made it worse it 's christmas and this day is shot now we 're coming through it but i'm sorry to say but my bucket list was almost over before it got started try if you want but it 's made us sick and almost in the hospital this is a christmas i 'd like to forget . 
i wanted to try this coffee once in my life i was very happy with the company that mailed it , and the timely manner in which they sent it . 
there was no seal of any kind on jar cap had loosened slightly and some of the paprika had spilled out would not chance using an open jar so in the trash it went . 
i ordered smoke paprika , unfortunately i received regular sweet i called and spoke with a gentleman , who promised to send me the smoke paprika and apologized for the mistake made until today \( 1 month maybe 2 later \) still have n't received anything or heard from the company very disappointed . 
have n't used it yet , but if going by past marshal creek products \? should be good . 
the details say br product features br 12 blister pez packs br 3 pez candy refills in each pack , br disney 's cars pez assortment br br product description br cars pez dispensers featuring lightning mcqueen , mater , sally and doc hudson each is individually bagged and include two great tasting candy refills br br i only got 6 blister packs and only got 3 of the 4 characters also the picture showed 12 packages obviously they put a 6 dispensers in the title \( i thought that to be a misprint \) and took a 12 pack and busted it down and sent me half for the price that was for 12 rip off ! ! ! . 
the blend of ingredients is great and a good balance of dried fruit and nuts that our family enjoys i was having trouble finding it in the local stores that i shop so i thought i would shop for this online i was happy to find it but unhappy about how much more it costs to order online than picking it up at a local store i do n't think i will order it again online and will simply keep my eyes open when i shop locally . 
i was quite excited to try this product , so i bought 4 packs we opened one , and i tested a half tablet no result my wife tried the other half ditto the next day , we tried a full tablet , letting it completely dissolve over the entire tongue i found the tablets pretty tasty themselves , while my wife found them too chalky to enjoy anyway , again there was no effect with lemons , chili sauce , etc our daughter also had no discernible change in her taste of foods br br happily for me , the company is going to refund me for the other three packages but i would have preferred that they 'd worked i was looking forward to bringing them out at an upcoming party . 
i guess everyone 's taste buds are different this product did n't work for me every food item tasted as it should \( . 
dissolved an entire tab on my tongue and was disappointed to discover that it had no effect on any of the foods that i tried . 
after taking a tab , i was able to eat a hot pepper , but it did n't really taste sweet or good at all , just not very hot then i tried some cayenne pepper , which remained hot with no alteration in taste this is a nice idea , but did n't work for me . 
i bought my mberry pack from mberry us online hoping to use it to curb my sweet tooth i followed the directions to the letter , allowing the tablet to dissolve completely on my tongue i then tried balsalmic vinegar nothing happened to the taste at all except that my tongue burned a little so i tried hot sauce nothing happened again except that my tongue burned a lot then i tried regular vinegar nothing happened again i even tried taking a second tablet , but it still did nothing but slightly burn my tongue huge waste of money super disappointing does not work ! . 
not much to say , other than the product solicitation is all hype ! i carefully followed the directions on the packaging of the mberry miracle fruit tablets and the results were about as miraculous as one of those potato chips baring the face of mary magdelene ! sorry believers of miracles this is one that wo n't make the tonight show ! . 
i was excited about these and had organized a whole event for my fiancee 's birthday around these tablets br placed an order well in advance , namely 3 weeks in advance br br after two weeks of waiting , i received a notification that my order was being cancelled for some mysterious as yet to be determined problem the email attempted to spread the blame between amazon , its supplier and some mysterious unknown factor , ultimately taking no real responsibility for the blunder br br color me frustrated and confused because while they said they are stopping all orders for the time being , their company website still shows the product in stock and ready for orders br br this to say the least was very disappointing and more so because the company 's response was very wishy washy and lame in my experience , when a company screws up \( mind you it was n't just my order , it was a whole slew of orders that got cancelled \) br they should own up and take responsibility thereby showing some integrity , rather than mutter some indecipherable mumbo jumbo that does nothing to explain nor solve the customers problem . 
i'm jealous of whoever thought of this , but the actual product turns out to be pretty unimpressive it turns out , if you eat half a fruit roll up , then eat asparagus , the aspragus tastes differently than you might expect there that 's all you need to know don't buy this product , just buy some gushers next time you 're at wal mart 2 star review because i like gushers . 
i dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing i added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter , but it didnt make them taste good it makes really sour things slightly sweeter but no miracle . 
well i bought these to have a food tripping party with my wife i had a spread before us of lemons , limes , strawberries , blackberries , oranges , and grapefruit we both started with half a pill each as per the reviews here i then took a bite of a lemon i guess is was sweeter but not by much , though i was able to eat it it was like a sweet tart food which i guess is because of the acid in the fruit i then ate another half of pill because the instructions that came with the pills stated to take a full one i tried again it made the lemons bearable but not super sweet you would not be able to eat an entire be happy i went onto the other fruits and the same thing you could still taste the tart with a sweet aftertaste my wife said this , well it makes it so you can eat lemons , but who wants to sit around eating lemons all day \? i'm disappointed but the price was cheap enough and it was a fun thing to do with my wife i 'll pawn these off on friends and see what they say to all the people who threw parties and raved and raved about how everyone loved them , my guess is that they did n't want you to feel bad . 
it did n't work for me maybe its because i could n't get past letting the whole tablet dissolve because to me the tablet tasted like vomit . 
after reading reviews and testing these out with friends , i can say this everyone 's tastes \( and tastebuds \) are different what is not sweet to one person is super sweet to another so be ye warned , results for these may vary br br i found that the tablets did n't make things sweet as much it cut down on the sourness , almost like a numbing effect ever put sugar on a lemon slice and bit into it \? the sour kick is still there , just canceled out i'm certainly not going to be eating them like candy as some reviews suggest br br tried out a few beer types , with mixed results beers that are fruity citrus ended up gross , as it would taste like i mixed in a mouthful of juice with the beer dark beers like an irish red were my favorite br br i really recommend going out to eat so you can try a variety of things certain foods will take you for surprise \( ranch dressing , for example , was notably different and very good \) . 
maybe the miracle fruit does not work for everyone it had very little effect when i used it i started with a clear pallet , let the pill dissolve on my tongue etc then i tried the classic first , a lime i noticed , barely , that it was not quite as pucker inducing as it may have been without the mberry but just slightly and it did not add any sweet it just inhibited a hint of sour other foods like vinegar , vinegar chips , guinness , strawberries , cheese , etc many recommended fruits and foods have very little impact and after just a few minutes , i could notice any change br br so , either , some people just do n't have the same level of effect or much of the miracle berry effects are group dynamics and heightened suggestibility either way , they were a let down . 
these tablets did work , but were not nearly as effective as i had expected i set up an entire spread of foods , cheeses , fruits , vegetables , liquids etc to try and when my friends and i allowed the tablets to dissolve , they only worked on a couple things and only for a very short period of time \( maybe 5 10 min \? \) . 
these tablets hardly work in comparison with the actual berries if you want flavor tripping then buy a box of the synsepalum dulcificum berries or grow your own plant instead of wasting money on the pill tablets in my opinion . 
they do make sour stuff sweet for a bit , but sometimes it gives it an odd flavor great novelty item . 
i 've tried this with multiple foods , at different times , and with anywhere between one and three tablets , all held on different areas of the tongue while i could swear there were minor changes at low quantities , this did n't change no matter how many were tried i'm sure that the miracle berries are authentic , but my friend and i did n't experience anything as incredible as people say , or even anything noteworthy i would go for the actual fruit next time . 
this tablet which is referred to as the miracle berry is used to distort taste of unpleasant \( to you \) items you can let 1 dissolve in your mouth , swishing around once or twice , then bite a lemon and it taste sweet it is an odd sort of sweet it comes with a list of items you can use it with , lemons , strawberries , cheese i was using it to try and mask the taste of the salt water flush while doing the master cleanse it does not mask salt water not sure of a use i 'd have for it it does what it claims , just not needed for me . 
i tried the frooties mberry and the effect lasted one hour for me i purchased this version since it had excellent reviews and was a slightly higher price br br this version lasted only ten minutes i tried tablets out of three different packages from three different batches to make sure it was not a faulty batch the results from each test was the same br br i would not suggest this version of the product , other tablet versions may be more effective but would suggest actual berries . 
quite disappointed the pills do n't last that long \( it wears off after a few tries per pill \) and not all the food items on the suggested list works e g cheese maybe it was a bad batch , but i'm not taking the risk to purchase it again . 
i tasted about half of the different foods on the big list of recommendations most tasted slightly different some got a sweet tickling in the mouth i got the strongest effects from vinegar , ketchup mustard and salt vinegar chips but nothing tasted miraculously better as i had expected as others have pointed out , everyone reacts differently the two other people i did it with seemed to have about my reaction as well one experienced a bit stronger and the other one a bit weaker than me you could try this if you are interested but i would n't buy it again . 
worked very little sweetened fresh pineapple but changed the taste to a bit bitter br a sour orange it did help it did n't work on anything else at all . 
first of all , these things taste pretty bad if you can handle the taste while they melt on your tongue , maybe it would n't be as bad but i really did n't notice much change in the taste of foods lemons tasted sweet , but that 's all i noticed i considered trying two at a time , but they just tasted so bad to me that i have never used them again . 
after reading the reviews on amazon and researching food ideas online i got some friends together and we all divulged out of the seven of us who took it , three of us just felt sick after the process all of us concluded that while our taste buds were playing tricks on us , they were not necessarily good tricks i would n't say sour things tasted sweet for instance , i would say they tasted weird kind of like lychees but not very good ones the only thing i tried that really improved after dissolving the pill on my tongue was a coors light it tasted like a pretty good pilsner after the pill , and everyone seemed to like this , but sometimes a nice cold coors light is just what you need , so if you have nothing left to spend your money on , this is n't the worst choice in the world , but do n't expect a miracle , because that is not going to happen expect a stomach ache , a loss of appetite , and then you wo n't find disappointment . 
my husband and i were excited to try them we bought pineapple , beer , lemon , lime , hot peppers , cheese and wine the only thing we noticed any difference in was the lemon and lime the lemon was pretty easy to eat because it added some sweetness it remained quite sour though we each let one tablet dissolve on our tongue as directed so not sure what the problem was . 
i and a friend tried these tablets before sampling various kinds of foods we 'd seen suggested online , but noticed no effects whatever we used them as suggested , then even tried multiple tablets at once maybe i got a bad batch or maybe we have unusual taste buds , but in any case it was very disappointing makes me think i should have tried the berries themselves instead . 
after reading several glowing reviews about this product , i decided to buy it and see for myself how great it is br br after following the instructions , i taste tested a variety of items , that were suggested on the packaging none of which seemed to have any affect on lemons , i noticed a slight taste change , however the lemon was no sweeter br br bottom line the product is over hyped , and in my opinion , is not worth the buying i know it 's definitely not something i will ever purchase again . 
stumbleupon users , be wary i was browsing when i stumbled upon an article about miracle berries a cool new fad that apparently causes things to taste different than they normally would naturally , i tried to see where i could get my hands on some br br once i found the mberry miracle fruit tablets , i did some research i always look at a lot of reviews and alternatives before buying anything on amazon the price was relatively cheap , i figured , if it worked as advertised the aggressive claims on the product 's page and the amazon user reviews also furthered my need to investigate this mystery product , so i bought two packs one for me and one for my friend br br after both of us trying the miracle berry tablets , i 'd have to say that the product is extremely overhyped , and the experience was , unfortunately , lacking br br the way mberry talks about their tablets , you 'd expect to have a willy wonka esque food tasting bonanza sadly , this is n't the case , and though the tablets do change the flavors of many foods to a degree , it 's much more subtle than you 'd probably like no snozzberries here i found this to be the case for me , and i was hoping maybe my taste buds were maybe just a bit more dull , but my friend reported the same experience br br i'm giving the product 2 stars , not because i hated the product , but because i was very let down with the experience and taking that fact into consideration , i do n't think it 's worth the money . 
not worth the cost br br i have only had these as free samples br br i would pay 5 for a pack of 10 i may even be willing to pay 10 00 for a pack of 10 br anything more than 10 is total robbery br br so , obviously , 17 99 is way too much br br this product is super cool , and i loved how it worked br br but , really \? 18 00 \? br br mberry should market their product as a food enhancer , not as a flavor tripping experience br br if mberry does that , and prices their products reasonably , it will gain customers br br keeping there product around as a flavor tripping experience will surely make it a passing fad . 
i bought these tablets to try during lunch at work four of us each tried one tablet , tasted various foods , and noticed no difference at that point , i gave up , but two intrepid friends went on to try four tablets each they reported strange flavors in some of the foods they tried , but many items remained unaffected among those that were was a fruit punch powerade reported to taste so sweet as to be very repulsive \( like drinking pure sugar \) , and a cashew which apparently tasted like heaven most other affected foods were impacted negatively br br in all , we were unimpressed with these tablets while they did accomplish their flavor changing purpose , it took a lot of tablets before any change was noticeable and the experience , though fun , was rather pricey considering how many tablets were required i was really hoping for a bigger impact . 
my girlfriend loves grapefruit , but i absolutely hate the stuff for her , it starts and ends very sweet , for me \( and most people in the world \) it starts sweet and ends bitter after we tried the a href http www amazon com gp product b001lxya5q miracle berry fruit tablets a tablet , there was a small difference for both of us for me , the bitterness subsided a small amount not even enough to worth mentioning for her , the grapefruit tasted like one of the sweetest ones she 'd ever had br br however , the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes both of which tasted noticeably better however , the effect of a single tablet wore off completely within 5 minutes to be honest , i hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour , but as is , you 're paying quite a bit per minute for these things \( we paid 20 for ten tablets w shipping \) br br would i try it again \? after the tablets we have left are finished , i think not i already enjoy gala apples , bananas , watermelon , oranges , and strawberries without this tablet i can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit , lemons or limes directly \( lemon and lime are fine in foods \) br br if you 're dead set on trying these tablets , try it with some of your friends , but do n't expect too much . 
i read all the positive reviews and thought i 'd give it try first of all it tasted stale secondly i had to use 5 spoonfuls just to get any taste and then it did n't taste like the chocolate it tasted more like olvatine for the young people out there , ovaltine was drink in the 50 's , which i did n't like any better we all have different tastes for my part i wo n't be ordering this again update i bought the milk chocolate at the same time and decided to try that it was delicious i ca n't explain the difference but i 'd recommend the milk chocolate just stay away from the one with the marshmallows . 
i'm a huge stephen 's fan but i 'd only ever had the regular milk choc hot cocoa deciding to be a little more health conscious i thought i 'd try the fat free variety don't ! \) okay , if you are n't expecting it to be like the regular version then go for it it 's much better than other fat free hot cocoa varieties but does n't do justice to regular stephen 's hot cocoa i'm going back to the good stuff . 
i was a little dissapointed it tastes good it is just a little watery tasting land of the lakes is better but they dont have sugar free so for sugar free i can give a heads up on this product . 
so i am a huge chocolate peanut butter freak , and have been looking for a peanut butter cup cocoa for a while i finally broke down and ordered this after a few months hemming and hawwing about it now i aadmit to not reading the directions the first cup and at first was like wow slightly chocolate water and added a few more spoonfuls of the mix to my cup and it improved but was not quite what i expected and this was made with water \( i was at work and had little choice \) the next day i deceided to try it again at home in my hot cocoa machine with milk and there was a great improvement ! ! so as a result i'm going to try an experiment tonight and make a shake in the blender with the mix ! ! ! i said im a peanut butter cup freak ! ! ! . 
i ordered the no sugar added version i usually like no sugar added or low sugar products ice cream , yogurt , hot chocolate etc but this one was terrible like the other reviewer , this tasted like ovaltine i had to use like 5 spoons of the powder to get the taste i do n't know what to do with 5 other cans i will probably donate . 
this is an ok hot cocoa i had been using land o'lakes product , but wanted to try this for a change the taste is comparable , but the portions in each packet is smaller i still like land o'lakes hot cocoa better . 
i love dark chocolate so when i saw the reviews of this kind i figured i 'd give it a try now taste is a matter of individuality so i 'll give you the difference in this belgian dark chocolate by stephen 's and my usual nestle rich chocolate br br belgian 150 calories per serving , serving is 3tlb mix and only 3 4 cup water or milk br vs br nestle 80 calories w water per serving , serving is 2tlb mix and a whole cup of water br br belgian total fat 3 5g , sodium 240mg , total carbs 27g , sugars 22g , protein 2g br br nestle total fat 3g , sodium 170mg , total carbs 15g , sugars 12g , protein 1g br br i first mixed the belgian mix as directed but could n't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me it is creamy , but just too sweet when i use the nestle i only use 1 2tlb and a squirt of dark choc syrup and i'm happy with that so i then mixed the belgian as i do with the nestle and it 's ok i ca n't rave about it due to the fact that it 's higher in sugars and sodium than the nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration br to me dark chocolate should n't be as sweet \( or sweeter \) as milk chocolate , i'm sure that 's why i prefer dark chocolate i 'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times br br but as i 've said it 's all in your individual taste , i just wish they would have listed the nutrient facts along with their ingredients br not bad , just not all that great if you do n't like really sweet hot chocolate . 
this product contains partially hydrogenated oils which is very detrimental to your health i would rather pay more for a product which does not contain transfats . 
i bought a case of this stuff \( dark chocolate \) based on the positive reviews big mistake this is half a step above swiss miss it is definitely not up to the level of archer \( target brand \) , twinings \( some grocery stores \) , or cadbury \( overseas or very few grocery stores \) br br cocoa is the 4th ingredient no chocolate as an ingredient bunch of fats and fillers archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient that 's more like it br br stephen 's chocolate has bad very light color , little aroma , thin , does n't dissolve a very disappointing purchase . 
i love hot chocolate and am always trying new ones , but this was the absolute worst cherry hot chocolate i have ever tasted ! ! i was hoping it would be good so i bought 2 cans after 1 cup , i threw both cans away if you want a really great cherry hot chocolate , add 3 4 teaspoons of the cherry juice from a jar of maraschino cherries to your favorite milk hot chocolate yum ! ! ! add more if you use dark hot chocolate . 
ended up with a case of the stephen 's chocolate rasberry and a case of the stephen 's french vanilla br cocoa i really wanted to believe the 100 positive feedback on here , but you should never believe br what you read , right \? br i guess the 1st thing i look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it this seemed just br watery and weak it looks like a no fat soymilk br i added more than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so so br br i am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and clumped and stuck to the spoon yuk br 5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for br the same amount of servings \? br granted , amazon 's price is better than the manufactures website since there is no shipping through br here and shipping is at a premium through stephen 's gourmet br i would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first , do not bother wasting your money to buy br 6lbs of cocoa mix at one time you might end up doing what i will have to do when you do n't like it br sigh br give it away . 
unfortunately i did n't notice this until i received the product i guess i 'll be giving it away to friends family that do n't mind it br br tastes artificial like coffee creamer br br ingredients br sugar , sweet whey , maltodextrin , partially hydrogenated coconut oil , cocoa \( processed with alkali \) , corn syrup solids , non fat dry milk , natural artificial flavor , sodium caseinate \( a milk derivative \) , salt , mono and diglycerides , dipotassium phosphate , carrageenan , soy lecithin . 
this review is for their dark chocolate most who like dark chocolate are into the pure chocolate taste and its health effects not the sweetness ! just as with good coffee , its not necessary to make it overly sweet or flavored since there are n't that many sweet freak fatties drinking it the ancient incas did n't use any sugar at all with their chocolate ! br br i did give it an extra star just for having a dark chocolate drink product since their are n't many companies that even make one , so kudos to them for that . 
ended up with a case of the stephen 's chocolate rasberry and a case of the stephen 's french vanilla br cocoa i really wanted to believe the 100 positive feedback on here , but you should never believe br what you read , right \? br i guess the 1st thing i look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it this seemed just br watery and weak it looks like a no fat soymilk br br it kind of makes me think of baby formula the other reviewer who said like a hot vanilla br milkshake is close to describing it but it is not creamy enough in my opinion to qualify as such br br i added more than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so so br br i am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and br clumped and stuck to the spoon yuk br 5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for br the same amount of servings \? br granted , amazon 's price is better than the manufactures website since there is no shipping through br here and shipping is at a premium through stephen 's gourmet br i would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first , do not bother wasting your money to buy br 6lbs of cocoa mix at one time you might end up doing what i will have to do when you do n't like it br sigh br give it away . 
the company does not operate properly i ordered the french vanilla that is the selection i clicked on and i recieved the white chocolate they should contact a buyer before shipping a substitution . 
i bought some of this chocolate for my mother who ca n't have much caffeine she used to drink nestle hot cocolate , fat free caffeine free , but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches anyway , i saw the milk chocolate flavor of stephen 's on here , looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so i ordered a bunch of it for mom 110 bucks worth we got it today and i opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor i thought they sent the wrong kind i checked my order and found out i indeed ordered the wrong flavor see , the canisters look exactly the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle that 's the only difference between the canisters and since the initial thumbnail images on amazon are so small , it 's easy to not see such a little difference yes , its' technically my fault , but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters not only that , amazon would not take it back , even though it all was unopened , because its food and the company who makes it basically said sorry , but it sucks to be you so here i sit , 110 dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use . 
this is a horrible step by pop to change the formula they now use cheap 'maltose' \( barley malt sugar high glycemic 105 \) in place of most of the honey , and only a miniscule amount of the herbs which were so effective in the original formula huge disappointment , and shame on pop for corporatizing and cheapening their once outstanding products br br as with the other reviewer , i once recommended this to everyone now i will go out of my way to steer clear of recommending anything by prince of peace try source naturals wellness homeopathic cough formulas they 're much cleaner and work pretty well . 
price was misleading , once the high shipping rate was added , the tea was no longer the 'deal' it was promoted to be although once it finally arrived , it was half decent tea , but not worth the shipping and the wait , will go to my local tea house next time . 
i have orderred jeremiah 's pick coffee organic breakfast blend whole bean coffee more than 5 times however the last lot i received with really bad quality lots of broken coffee beans and very oily hope the seller can check what happen i may not try it again . 
i was really disappointed in this coffee it 's a darker roast than i was expecting and the bag has no expiration date my coffee tasted quite stale and old . 
the jeremiah 's 5lb bag of ethiopian coffee is often sold out , so i 've been looking for a good roast with similar value i'm ok with a more medium roast , but this coffee seems more mild then i would have expected still a good deal , but i wish it had more flavor in general , i 've had good luck with jeremiah 's brand , although sometimes the bags are not as well sealed as they should be . 
love the cinnamon taste but way too sweet i gave this to my mother who loves sweets and she said she could n't eat it either need to promote the cinnamin dlavor and cut the sugar . 
only one store in my area , sprouts , sells wheatgrass in their produce section whole foods sells it , but it is a goodly distance from my house so i only get wheatgrass from them once in a great while i have a bunny who enjoys wheatgrass as a treat , so i go to sprouts to get it for her , but wanted to grow my own since it is expensive and requires frequent shopping trips so i bought these kits and decided to grow it myself first i have to say i was impressed at how quickly they shipped my order so i planted the seeds on friday and by sunday night , i had wheatgrass sprouts like crazy the instructions are clear and easy to follow , and deliver abundant grass as promised br br i have to say , though , that the grass does n't look at all like the wheatgrass in stores the blades are way taller \( 8 inches \) and about twice the thickness of the wheatgrass i am used to buying for my bunny i took pictures but discovered that my camera 's memory card does n't fit this new computer , so i ca n't show prospective buyers a picture of it rats since bunnies have sensitive digestive systems and you have to be careful what you feed them , i do n't feel safe feeding this grass to her i ca n't return it because i aready cracked open the kit and grew grass from one of the three seed kits the grass is probably fne , but as a bunny owner , i want other bunny owners to know that this grass is n't like the wheatgrass in stores , jut so they are n't surprised and disappointed like i was . 
first , the product pictured is not what you get br br what you really get is are tiny packets called sticks suitable for flavoring bottled water the box does n't even say what size bottle it is sized for br br i'm not keeping it so i ca n't tell you how it tastes . 
the mushrooms that were sent were not labeled like the picture , they had the old red and black label when i opened the can and tasted them the had a very metallic taste and the inside of the can was discolored so i threw them away rather than take a chance of making myself sick there is a date code on the top of the can of 0303 which i have no idea what that means and i ca n't find any explination of this code online i will not buy this brand mushrooms anymore i am a mushroom lover and i have bought many large cans of mushrooms in the past and i have never had them taste like these did . 
i was very disappointed with the quality of the chocolate br if you want the best , i 've found that ethel m 's chocolate liquor barrels are incredibly good but you will pay the price ! . 
i love liquor filled chocolates i received these as a gift and found the gel like liquor not to be very strong it was almost as if the liquor had been cut with sweet syrup and all the alcohol cooked out a young child would n't even get a buzz from these the chocolate itself was ok better than hershey 's and nestle but not as good as godiva or lindt . 
i meant to order anthony berg 's chocolates and got this one by mistake yikes , not a good outcome the chocolate is poor and the gel like liquor is worse do n't make the mistake that i made . 
you know how the chocolate turns light brown when it gets old \? that 's how these were at the top they were that lighter shade of brown as if they were old that part just did n't taste right , but the liquor inside was good these candies were n't fresh . 
delivery of the product was quick , however the items are smaller than how they appear on line next time i would order the larger size . 
an otherwise good gum reduced to a three star review by really mind boggling packaging i fail to see the advantage of the foil covered capsule approach i lose approximately one piece a pack by pressing just the wrong way and having the gum shoot out of the package like a cannon , forever lost br br the gum itself is decent , lasts for slightly less than a twenty five minute car drive , packs a comfortable punch , and improves breath still , it 's not outstanding , and does n't overcome the poor packaging , so wo n't be buying any more . 
ca n't say much about the product itself was a gift for friends in california who had just given birth and it arrived 5 6 days after shipping totally melted the seller gave early warning before shipping stating the weather had been abnormally hot and that they could not be held responsible for packages missed and left to sit in the heat i assumed that was not an issue considering my wife was at their home and aware the package would be arriving and i had also purchased priority shipping \( additional 8 dollars \) no such luck be sure whoever you are buying these from gives you absolute specifics before you buy br just to be fair , i have to say the seller was very quick and courteous with responses to my concerns unfortunately she did n't even consider any form of compensation though i really hate throwing money away and giving a less than memorable gift at the same time . 
my cats all love this product just like they love the other flavors i dare not run out of these treats or i might have a kitty uprising ! . 
bottom line , this made my cat projectile vomit i 've never had a problem with him eating friskies before but , i knew cheezy craze just did n't sound right it came as a sample in one of the larger bags not fun to clean up after partial digestion . 
my cats go crazy for the party mix and mainly the cheese flavor it sells for 1 50 br to 1 89 a pouch in my local stores , so i was looking on amazon hoping to find a better br price i looked at this listing because of the price of 6 48 , assuming it was for several br pouches , like most of the other listings here but no number of pouches was listed and the br only indication comes from looking at the shipping weight this ia apparently the price br for a single pouch this is a problem with amazon quantities are not always posted br and you can really get ripped off overpaying i saw one review for friskies canned br food , where the reviewer thought she was ordering a multican pack for 12 but the br actual number was not posted and she ended up receiving one can ! . 
i love chia , but i have gotten two different packages of this brand that were rancid the expiration dates were over a year away amazon does n't allow food returns , and navitas said i would have to ship them the seeds for them to check before they would send me new ones i will still enjoy chia , but i 'll avoid this brand from now on . 
i bought nutiva organic chia seeds before , two pouches 14 ounces each 16 24 with tax , this brand in one 16 ounce pouch 14 83 the quality and the taste are the same , but the latter one is way much more expensive buy nutiva organic chia seeds , not navitas in terms of the taste , i usually toast mine and add them everywhere cereal , yogurt , oatmeal , etc tastes great and full of fiber . 
this simple yet tasteless product did what it said it would , thicken gravy and soups this product in my opinion should be used in the morning before work or people who are studing late nights as chia makes you energized . 
i love the nativa brand , however , they always seem to leave out very important details on their packaging br br i heard so many praises about how much better the chia seeds are than flax seeds br br upon arrival i opted to use these in my salad as opposed to the flax seeds i 've been using br br the chia seeds caused the most horrible and painful bloating i ever experienced granted , i did use the full serving size , but since then i lowered the amount and still with even just a quarter of a teaspoon or less i get the bloating br br i have since switched back to the flax seeds which did n't wreak havoc on my intestinal tract br br i am hoping i can find some way to use these seeds in the future because i hate seeing anything go to waste br br my advice if you are set on trying the chia seeds is to start out with a very low amount ! ! ! and stick with that low amount until your stomach builds up a tolerance for these seeds . 
i bought this product not that many months ago and loved it but no longer buying this brand because it doubled in price ! i bought it for 10 originally will buy another brand . 
i bought these to put in smoothies and they do not totally grind up in the blender i am going to try to grind them by hand before i add to the blender it all depends on your texture preference i do not mind seeds from fruits but these bugged me ! . 
this was the first time i tried purchasing a food product over the internet , and as feared i was sent something other than what was pictured br br this package contains chia seed powder , which i assume is ground up seed \( or the remainder from packaging whole seeds \) that you have no way of identifying whether or not has additional filler br br not going to bother returning a 7 product , but just disappointed when the page advertises whole seeds . 
i was surprised by the number of 5 star reviews of this product its a tiny gritty seed that gets stuck in every corner of your mouth and the taste is like nothing kind of like poppy seeds but with out the taste i finally ask myself why am i eating this annoying seed and put it out back in the bird feeder unfortunately they do n't seem to like it much either . 
this is a pleasant tea , it tastes mostly of chamomile unfortunately for me , it does n't do too much to squelch heartburn i'm now 36 weeks along and have had heartburn almost the whole time , and i was hoping this would help out but it really has n't had an effect i do like the tea just as a mild beverage , but i ca n't recommend it for pregnancy related heartburn . 
you think you 're doing something good for your kid when you invest a little more to get an organic formula sadly , that 's not the case here this is a horrifically constipating formula lots of pain and straining , guaranteed having to take measures to prevent this \( offering juices , water , etc \) is just not a sensible approach br br also , the manufacturers use sucrose instead of lactose to save money , and they use a lot of it with the same sweetness as country time lemonade , similac organic 's sucrose based formula may also set your child up for future diabetes check the ny times article for more info on this br br bottom line painful constipation in the near term , possible diabetes and certainly a sweet tooth in the future no , thanks ! . 
2 0 out of 5 stars read this article first , august 11 , 2009 br by pregbaby \( florida \) see all my reviews br i thought i was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought similac was a brand i could trust to be good for baby that is , until i came across this ny times article about the sugar they use br br from the article br br parents may be buying similac organic because they believe that organic is healthier , but babies may have a reason of their own for preferring similac organic it is significantly sweeter than other formulas it is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar , or sucrose , which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas br br no health problems in babies have been associated with similac organic but to pediatricians , there are risks in giving babies cane sugar sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars once babies get used to its sweeter taste , they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods and some studies suggest that they might overeat , leading to rapid weight gain in the first year , which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity . 
we switched from the advance similac to the organic product thinking it would be better as we prefer organic foods ourselves it was a disaster with our 2 month old baby getting constipated and progressively worsening her intake till she fell drastically below her calorie intake we discontinued the product within five days and switched back to the previous similac and she is fine now her feeding and calorie intake is back to normal .
