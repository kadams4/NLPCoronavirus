the US is handling this #COVID19 so poorly
Deciding not to care for the elders? It seems unreal, a b horror movie. It breaks my heart. Can‚Äôt even wrap my head around it. #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #ItalyCoronavirus
I understand schools/companies need to shut down due to the #CoronavirusOutbreak but i cannot afford to live if I am not able to work
Guys lot of countries are under lockdown. Its time we fill up our refrigerator with food, stock enough groceries and disinfectants for home. Shortly we are going to get 2 week work from home notice #coronavirusindia #pandemic #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus
It‚Äôs 2 am and I can‚Äôt sleep because I‚Äôm worried about the #CoronavirusPandemic

1/x Tips for coping with #Covid_19 anxiety. 1) take good self-care measures for health 2) wash hands regularly per CDC guidelines 3) limit social media use &amp; checking the news (ex: no more than 30 min a day, or check news once a day) 4) avoid ritualistic behaviors #CBTWorks
Is money really more important than peoples lives? Surely the sooner everything is shut down the sooner #COVID19 is stopped. I‚Äôve heard so many pompous medical professionals say we‚Äôre so much better prepared than in Italy. Really? #pillocks
Wow...Tom Hanks &amp; Rita Wilson test positive #COVID19
300K people have been tested in China	200K people have been tested in South Korea	9K people in the US. Gross negligence by this administration and we have been failed yet again. #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID #pandemic #CancelEverything

Many crucial moments have come and gone in the decision timelines of world leaders. As the mounting data suggests, most countries have responded with too little, too late. Perhaps it‚Äôs time for a data scientist as president. #CoronavirusPandemic #Wisdom #dreaming #COVID19

Schools should be closed. Period. There was no snow, so I know y‚Äôall got those snow days in your pockets. Unless y‚Äôall want bodies dropping like flakes. #CoronavirusPandemic #CancelEverything #CloseTheSchools
Virus carriers may not show symptoms of #Covid_19 for as long as 14 days, and in the meantime they‚Äôre potentially spreading germs. The bottom line is that this is such a new virus, there is just a lot we don‚Äôt yet know. I‚Äôd rather err on the side of caution to protect our public.
Aware of the panic and all about the likely lockdown--It would do everyone good if we not only think of our own health, but also of the welfare of our families and communities. We might (unknowingly) spread the #COVID19, so please avoid travelling.
This day, and more broadly this period of time, are historic. This is an event that will be remembered for the rest of our lives and then some. #Coronavirus #COVID19
All you Spring Breakers, stay safe and don‚Äôt bring anything back to the 806! As far as we know, Lubbock is coronavirus-less. But that could all change in a matter of weeks. #COVID19
The USA is still taking a reactive approach the #COVID19 instead of a proactive approach.  Communities need to be tested immediately.  Containment should be implemented across the board, meaning the public needs to immediately take measures to stop community spread of the virus.
So even if the flu is worse than #Covid_19 it‚Äôs still killing people today!? What kind of argument is this?
#COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #coronavirus I personally think that maybe all the affected countries should stop flights coming in and out of the country until they can contain this deadly virus ü¶†
It is the time to do more now so we can do less better later. #Covid_19 #covid19SA

Clean your counters. Just stay home and wait this out. And please stop thinking you‚Äôre invincible!! #Covid_19
I am talking to so many people at work who have #COVID19 symptoms who are being told they will not qualify for testing for various "reasons." They're told to self-quarentine by their Dr's. We truly dont know the extent of this because of the lack of testing!
Churches in U.K. are still gathering despite churches in America live streaming services and many large public gatherings globally being cancelled. Why are they not taking the safety of their congregations seriously and acting now? #CoronavirusPandemic
The government needs to act! stop nonessential travel, shut schools and universities, close sports events and music festivals. We need to learn from Italy or suffer the same fate #Covid_19

Is anyone in the general population reacting a normal amount to #coronavirus ?	Like not making it a complete joke OR buying 8 packs of TP.
So, stay indoors for 14 day, I probably won‚Äôt get paid for it, but I understand. But wait, this thing is world wide in warm weather climates, so it probably won‚Äôt just go away. And everything I‚Äôve read says you can keep getting it. I‚Äôm fine with a quarantine, than what? #COVID_19
Y‚Äôall		It‚Äôs time to set aside the political stuff. 	It‚Äôs time to set aside the hard feelings. 	It‚Äôs time to realize the next couple of months will be weird. 	It‚Äôs time to come together and ride this rollercoaster together and try to get through this the best we can. 	#Coronavirus
All UNR classes moved online following our spring break. This is a good move by the university! Thankful to work for an employer who values us and our students, and recognizes this situation for what it is: an emergency. #COVID19 #UNR
Why are people not taking Corona Virus seriously? The mortality rate of infected of 5%  or more in Italy is staggering! 	People don't realize how dangerous it is &amp; even if you get over it can scar you for life (literally) or you can spread it to your family members.#Coronavirus
They believe up to 10,000 people are probably infected even though only 590 cases have tested positive. This means other countries should be wary of their actual numbers. You can only find positive cases of #coronavirus if you test for it!
Can't stop thinking that there are actually still people who believe the #coronavirus is a hoax. Just boggles the mind. 		I guess these are the people that still believe #Trump &amp; his band of incompetent turds.		IMO Trump is toast this Nov.		#LiesKill	#JustTellUsTheTruth

The conference I was meant to go to in a couple weeks has been cancelled because of #Covid_19 		However it‚Äôs likely for the best, as my family are part of the high risk populations. It‚Äôs not worth the potential risk from being at a large and international event
I think the uk does need to go on lockdown for at least 7 days...		Clearly the virus can‚Äôt be contained...		Work should pay there staff wages through sick leave. 		To many lives at risk here		But then how will you even survive? How will low income families find it? #Covid_19

Will the coronavirus keep you from going out to eat?? My answer is yes #coronavirus
The #coronavirus might pull us apart physically for now. But as a people this should not be who we become in the long term. This too shall pass. Fear can sometimes feel stronger than Hope. But Hope overcomes all.
Well, batch 2019-2020 had the worst possible school ending through out the past years. Hopefully this will all end soon and everyone will be safe :3 	Just a reminder to everyone to wear masks if you‚Äôre sick and drink lots of water while having vitamin C.	#Covid_19
My body went through a lot with chemo/radiation. Since then, I have ridiculous immune reactions when exposed to the simplest things. I break out in a rash every time they flush my port (with saline only). Yeah, I‚Äôm worried that getting #Covid_19 would be particularly bad for me.

Social distancing will be a temporary instrument to deal with #Covid_19. However steps taken towards community well-being and sustainable living will matter far more in the long run.
Confused?  Why do u need a test to confirm your symptoms? If u think u have #COVID19, quarantine yourself.  There's no treatment you're missing out on.  If you're case is really serious, go to a hospital.
Imagine if #COVID19 lasts for longer. Has anybody detailed the consequences to countries economy and to ordinary people. No work, no traveling, no money, no food, and then?

So, today emails have been flying back and forth. Meetings have been called. Other meetings have been cancelled. This is a rapidly changing situation for us all. #coronavirus #covid„Éº19uk
#COVID„Éº19 is a virus.  It‚Äôs not going to disappear. We‚Äôre all going to have to deal with this at some point. 80% only get mild symptoms. Children are less likely than any other group to get severe symptoms. It‚Äôs an adult virus. Learn about #coronavirus instead of panicking.
Nurses were rock stars yesterday. 		Nurses are rock stars today. 		Nurses will be rock stars tomorrow. 		Thank you to EVERY nurse. The ones I know. The ones I don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre heroes!		#thankanurse #coronavirus #StayHome #SocialDistance
I very happy to see that with the fear of the #coronavirus, food security is not being forgotten. We are working hard to make sure our students are supported and they never have to worry about their next meal
The role of #China in anti-corona measures is marvellous. World must learn from China how to control #CoronavirusOutbreak , instead of blaming each other. This is a pandemic and countries need to take serious steps!!		#CoronavirusPandemic
Can Pakistan please have travel ban for 2-3 weeks? Unless we stop the travel ban, no amounts of lockdowns and closure of institutions/offices will hold off the spread of the virus. #CoronaVirusUpdates #COVID„Éº19 #CoronavirusOutbreak

I'm actually comforted by the rising number of people diagnosed with #COVID„Éº19. This means that people are being tested. 		REMEMBER: There are 10-25x more people WITH #coronavirus than what has been reported. Now it's about finding out who has it.
Why nobody helps Italy from EU, UN, WHO whatever? They are living a crisis, people are suffering to find beds, intensive care units are full, doctors have to make decision among patients üòî #coronavirus #ItalyCoronavirus
Stockpiling is feeding into the alarmist trend and you‚Äôre also infecting others around you- Fear is very infectious. Have common sense and brush up on your etiquettes, be wary but also know that actually quarantining yourself on such short notice is virtually impossible. #COVID19

No joke. #COVID19 stays active on up to 3 days on plastic and metal and at least one day on cardboard. Once ya get back in wash everything.
people talk about coronavirus like its nothing, in ohio 1600 people have been confirmed positive.  40 people have died, thats 0.025 percent, doesnt sound like alot but thats 175 million deaths worldwide based off the data in ohio alone.  #coronavirus

Comes to something when you feel you'd be better off living in a country presently more affected by #COVID19.		But seeing the community spirit of those in lockdown as well as hearing the news of how governments are responding makes me feel like we're lightyears behind in the UK.
134 cases of #covid19 have come to light, Pakistan becomes the hub of largest #coronavirus patients in South Asia. With 103 cases from Sindh, 15 from KPK, 8 from Balochistan, 5 from GB, 2 from Islamabad and 1 from Punjab.	#CoronaVirusUpdates
I have heard that #Covid19 has also struck in the USA. I advise you not to leave your house. Always wash your hands and buy masks and latex gloves. In ITALY, the supermarkets are always open and there is no lack of food. A strong hug to all. ü§ó
Special thanks to all medical professionals and emergency service staff who put themselves in danger to keep us safe - you are all amazing #coronavirus #MedicalStaff
I was reading that many cases of spread of #COVID19 are caused by asymptomatic people. If that is the case systematic screening could be a good solution to understand where the virus resides.
Overreaction is the best reaction tbh #COVID19 #coronavirus
Let's exercise extra caution during this period everyone. We will get through this pandemic. #COVID19

I feel like the United States' response to this pandemic was: plugging its ears, closing its eyes, and yelling "lalalala". And then this week, the United States finally opened its eyes and was like "shoot, that usually works. There goes plan A, B, and C!" #coronavirus #COVID19
First of all, we need to stop putting a time line on this virus as if someone is controlling it. YOU CAN RECOVER FASTER if you stay home and and STOP SPREADING IT. I understand the struggle, we all have bills and have to eat. STOP PANICKING #COVID19 #coronapocolypse

Just listened to doctors and nurses outside my exam room talk about how they were running out of places to eat due to the high volume of food service workers they had to deny #coronavirus testing to against their better judgement because they weren‚Äôt likely to die.
An important factor with the #coronavirus  pandemic is Time. How long before the majority of the population gets infected? How long before there is a vaccine or cure? How long before it #mutates to a deadlier strain? How long will we be In isolation?
someone should set up a pay it forward scheme so we can look after the elderly. #COVID19
Doctors and the whole medical staff are heroes ‚ù§Ô∏è	#coronavirus 	#CoronavirusOutbreak
This #CoronavirusPandemic is getting out of control! Every place is closed! Libraries, banks, Restraunts you name it.
final thoughts for today on #coronavirus is assume it‚Äôs on everything and that everyone has it. It‚Äôs almost impossible to not touch stuff between hand hygiene and eating as an example. Maintain 2 metres between everyone and stop being self conscious about reminding people as much
We need to unite as one species NOW to defeat this #pandemic, so we can get back to global warming! It‚Äôs cold out!		#COVID„Éº19  #coronavirus #GlobalWarming

Kudos to the hospitals that are restricting visitors, no one WANTS to do it, but it the RIGHT decision to keep our patients and staff safe. #coronavirus #COVID19
Long distance relationships are hard anyway, but when #COVID19 stops you from seeing a loved one for potentially months on end, it gets pretty darn miserable. Be thankful if you‚Äôre isolated with your loved ones.

Still seeing lots of calls for the HSE to release info on specific locations cases of #COVID19 are bring detected in		Why?		Your job is to act as though you have it and exercise extreme caution. This is the same whether everyone in your town has it or nobody has it
Anyone who felt relief when the CDC okayed free #coronavirus testing should know THAT'S WHAT UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE IS LIKE ALL THE TIME.
People are not taking the government advice seriously, isnt it time to step up these measures! #coronavirus #UKlockdown
Many people are welcoming folks from the UK who might have contracted the #CoronaVirus and they do not know that they might be aiding the spread. How do we get the word out. The government is just talking on TV. How many folks have TVs, or have power. We need to contain spread
It actually infuriates me that people can be so ignorant that they still want to to go clubbing, restaurants, big public places when the government have advised not to for our best interests to STOP the virus spreading. #COVID19
Just found out I might be a silent carrier for #coronavirus. My roommates coworkers is in quarantine after coming in contact with someone who tested positive. I cant get tested because I'm asymptomatic. I feel absolutely helpless #COVID2019
People are learning quickly. Even in Berlin. So the reality out there is not what the cynical version of #Corona Twitter wants us to believe. Sad fact is that all these adjustments are introduced weeks to late. #COVID19 has not been taken seriously at Bundeskanzleramt. (2)
Time we put the entire country in lockdown. Bring in a curfew! Too many cunts still skipping down the road; pretending nothing is the matter. If you do this you are an imbecile. STAY INSIDE!!! #lockdownuk #covid19UK #UKlockdown #londonlockdown #COVID19 #coronavirus #coronavirus

To everybody who thinks the #coronavirus isn‚Äôt a big deal, consider this: your chance of dying from it if you catch it is about the same as rolling a pair of dice and getting snake eyes.  Do you really want to play those odds?

Did ya really just ask me why I cant stop taking immunosuppressants if I'm "so worried" ?? Didn't know that I should suffer my chronic illnes so I can "stop worrying" and "come chill" #coronavirus is a huge risk to me (and my mom) even if I "look healthy" and happen to be 24
99% of them are innocent and they're unaware of this situation. So apart from screening, myself and most of my friends are educating them about the risk they're facing now. Just a little step in fighting against #COVID19 	I will continue this until my health allows me üôè

Why we don‚Äôt learn from Other countries about how treat  #coronavirus. China, tested the people and just redirect the people to a different building, to those who were +. Uk is using the same  üè• 4 everybody. So everybody is touching he same lift, the same doors and all around.
The fact that my girl had asthma got me stressed out more bout this #COVID19
+as responsable as they can to never even catch a cold least of all the #Covid_19 bc of my condition (lung surgery and asthmatic) but bc of my neighbor I have to take even MORE precautions and I have to wait for my family to come home so they can take out the trash ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Glad I live in a small enough town and we shouldn't be to badly affected with #coronavirus 	I'm seeing loads of pictures from across england with no social distancing and its giving me anxiety. 	Feel for the ones trying.

A lot of people returning to Canada this weekend left last weekend when they knew the full scope of this #Covid_19 situation. 	These people feel invincible. 	The likelihood that we get good self isolation compliance from them is low.

#Covid19 virus has an R0 of 6.6. Meaning that on average one infected  person could go on to infect atleast 6.6 other people. This can only be reduced by social distancing and self isolation. #Salonetwitter, please avoid crowded locations until the pandemic ends. Do am for Salone
Here‚Äôs a tip if you insist on going to a supermarket and queuing up. Place the length of the trolley between you and the person in front of you. That‚Äôs a nice distance so you at least put yourself at least risk. #SocialDistance #Covid_19

I've nearly finished fighting of a #COVID19 infection. Things I have learned: 		1) Its not always mild for younger people		2) The early stages were barely noticable		3) You will need all the paracetomol you can safely take		4) You need to take this seriously		5) People are kind.
As the saying goes, Prevention is better than cure, sadly there is no cure available for #CoronaVirus so we are only left with prevention.		So please take serious preventive measures and stay safe !!		#CoronaVirusPakistan

Am at some place near Eldoret town and I can confirm that here people are serious about #COVID19 ... You can't visit any premise without washing your hands first. Really commendable
y u shouldn't shake anyone this period:	The #COVID19 is transmitted through Resp droplets; Most people cover their mouths with their hands when they cough or sneeze which would obviously be contaminated with RD afterward. This droplets can be transferred during a handshake...
How many people world wide will have #COVID19 and never be tested? How many people will die without testing? The numbers we see are only a fraction of the reality. #WhereAreTheTests
So the situation is getting scarry... Hope everyone is taking care of their family, friends and themselves..	#COVID19

Really saddened by the #Covid_19 tragedy in #Italy. Unfortunately part of the problem is the endemic ignorance and acceptance of mediocrity which affects the country bar some heights of excellence like the heroes fighting in our hospitals. I hope this will be a wake up call.
But let's not lose heart. It can be slowed down. Stay in your homes, wash your hands regularly, call 1075 in case symptoms surface (coz state helplines most probably won't work) and don't hoard essential commodities		Doctors, Nurses and healthcare ppl need them more #Covid_19

Unless you too can rise from the dead I suspect Easter will be a bad time to stop practicing social distancing and #coronavirus mitigation efforts.
Can someone explain to our leaders that it's not considered shutdown/social distancing/reducing cross infection, if people are freely allowed to ride public transport/cars,leave their children to mingle at daycares &amp; kill time by multiple grocery store shopping trips #COVID19

I decree this the "Boy Who Cried Wolf" era. No one took #COVID19 and #socialdistancing seriously because it was the 69th thing that was THE END OF THE WORLD since 2010. SARS, H1N1, Democrats, Ebola,  ISIS, Republicans, etc. When everything is an emergency, eventually nothing is.

I want desperately to be able to DO something to stop #COVID19 . It's so frustrating that the best way to help is to just stay home.

Today the US was named the country with the most confirmed #COVID19 cases in the world. And there are still way too many American people who don't get that this is serious. It defies logic.
Y'all this Corona virus got y'all acting like selfish fools!  Can't even find rubbing alcohol!ü§¶ Stock piling everything and I bet you fools are still out and about in the public! üôÑüôÑ #annoyed #overit #COVID19

The USA now has more #COVID19 cases than any other country, despite the fact that in most states getting tested is still extremely difficult. The real number of cases is so much higher...		Why aren‚Äôt we all in lockdown?? This is beyond ridiculous and irresponsible. #LockdownUSA
Also to anyone chasing, use your head Saturday. With everything going on with #COVID19 and the possibility of this being a bigger day, I expect a lot of people to be out. Don‚Äôt gather in large groups and continue to social distance.
Why do so many people think that CLOTHES SHOPPING at Target for 20 minutes is essential right now?? üò° #coronavirus
I‚Äôm tempted to just go drive around and park and sit in the parking lots of stores and watch YouTube videos of people shopping in those stores... #COVID19 #QuarantineLife

Weird progression: People that were calling COVID-19 a hoax or some sort of cooked up conspiracy are now sharing petitions for mandatory lockdown. #coronavirus #CoronaLockdown
Staying home and self quarantining is not even remotely possible for those who are homeless. Which is why it falls on us as citizens of the world to SPEAK UP and DEMAND our elected officials take clear concise measures to assist the most vulnerable members of society #coronavirus
Idolizing the real everyday heroes getting us through this pandemic is who I hope society will idolize going forward... #thankyou #coronavirus #covid19 #savinglives #stayhome
Should we start a GoFundMe to help buy ventilators for the hospitals in states where elected officials don't kiss Trump's ass?		We can't do nothing and let people die because the president is a narcissistic sociopath. 		#Covid_19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #StayHome
Parenting in the time of #coronavirus: 		Playing outside w/my kid, we saw a preschool friend &amp; his dad. Friend, thrilled to see my kid, comes toward him. My kid shouts NO STAY BACK &amp; holds out a stick to keep friend away. Friend stops, confused. Tries again. Repeat.		üíî

It‚Äôs sad to see, read &amp; hear that ppl only take the #coronavirus serious if it hits close to home. If they don‚Äôt personally know someone with the illness or if they feel well, they don‚Äôt care. Or, some are in straight denial leading to some reckless decisions &amp; costing lives. Smh

Here‚Äôs an obvious tip, when showing footage on news services of pre this virus outbreak. Maybe a banner or something. Because when you see people shaking hands, kissing &amp; hugging maybe just maybe you‚Äôre sending confusing messages to people watching the news #coronavirus #skynews
Peeps Stop being ignorant. Stay home safe. Going out there increases the number of this #COVID19. You won't see it now but it's gon be too late the time you realize of many lives lost and tortured. Stay indoor and save million lives.
In this situation of lockdown we are taking all the  necessary steps to prevent #COVID19 likewise social distancing, staying at home but we are not getting expected support from govt. Govt must provide basic things to citizens at their doorsteps in order to make this LD a success
If there is one good thing this virus has done, is uniting Americans. I am starting to see on my social media feed a universal message. Let's curve this trajectory and let's flatten the curve TOGETHER #StayHome #COVID19 #SocialDistancing

You can buy 1200 ventillators at the cost of a single JF-17 block - 2 fighter airjet! While at the cost of orange line train you can get 49 JF-17s!	Unfortunately we hv a defense system, we all know!	#StayHomeStaySafe #CoronavirusOutbreak
Provision of free hand sanitizers, distribution of free nose masks to the market men and women won't be a bad start. Intervention centers properly equipped should be made available and their locations made known to the public.	#COVID19 	#StayAtHomeAndStaySafe 	#AbiaState
