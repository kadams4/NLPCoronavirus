#CoronavirusPandemic is trending because the media is pushing it for rating to make money on commercial time slots. They want you to panic and tune in for the latest. The fact of the matter is they are irrelevant on any matter. We have all the news we need on our phone
2020. What a time to be dead. #CoronavirusPandemic
I wish corona happened when I was in school!! Didn't ever want to go to class 😂 #CoronavirusPandemic
Y'all going to work tomorrow or y'all getting sick!? 		#CoronavirusPandemic
#CoronavirusPandemic Let's just declare marshall law and get it over with, screw the piecemeal steps
We should build a #Covid_19 wall 🤪
Is #2020 over yet? #Soleimani then #IranAttacks then #IranPlaneCrash we’re all gonna die #WW3 no good v bad Cheeto coverage #ImpeachedForLife then #Kobi disaster and now #CoronavirusPandemic 		We’re not even at the Ides of March yet.
I've sat on the Yings crapper before, I dont think #Covid_19 has a chance of infecting me.
Dear EVERYONE in the media, unless you are an EXPERT on the coronavirus, this is what we want to hear from you. "I don't know anything in regards to the coronavirus, so I'm going to talk about ________, and leave that to the experts."	#CoronavirusPandemic 	#sensationalismI understand the concerns over the #CoronavirusPandemic but this is getting ridiculous. There’s an illness that is 100% preventable and treatable. The world can’t just stop. All these athletes and celebrities get time off from work while normal Americans....
The government is collecting our 🧬 DNA + developing human DNA bank of course. #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaOutbreak
Safe to say the west is a failed society. 		This is what happens when you trust the media, modern education, and the government.		#CoronavirusPandemic
This does not make any sense. Someone or someones are up to something. #CoronavirusPandemic
Can people, please ! CALM THE FUCK DOWN ! It's a nasty flu, and if you've 80 with one lung you're fucked ! Everyone else - PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic
Your more likely to get killed by a drunk driver than the #coronavirus that’s the real epidemic #CoronavirusPandemic #FakeNews
Ill be damned if I let #coronavirus ruin my birthday plans. THE SHOW MUST GO ON
What is it with people being scared of corona it’s a great drink #Covid_19
a doctor can diagnosis somebody who has a regular cold with having the corona virus it's no different then how they diagnosis people with having hpv when they just have an allergic reaction to something they are eating they don't care about your health  #Covid_19People are absolutely losing their minds!  God help us if anything way more serious ever happens.  Thanks a lot Media/Press. 🙄 #COVIDー19 #coronavirus #mediapanic
won't be suprised if Italy betrays the world and joins coronavirus's side #WW1 #WW2 #coronavirus
People worried about Corona Virus don’t understand the horror that is the Wook Flu #COVID19 #itscoronatime #wookflu #festierat
Sanitizing my insides with tequila. Alcohol is a solution.		Tagging all #coronavirus hashtags #CoronaVirusUpdates #CoronaOutbreak #coronapocalypse #COVID2019 #COVID2019 #COVID #CoronavirusPandemic #Coronavirustruth
This #COVID19 fiasco could be an interesting story line for a movie script.		Its possible title: Sujud Terakhir.
Lot of shit going on right now.  A lot of it is really dumb.  Absolutely no one asked and absolutely no one cares....but my advice?  Be kind to one another and love the people you love fiercely.  Give and get hugs freely and act as a beacon of joy in an angry world 	#Covid_19
I just read that #Coronavirus is like pasta. The Chinese invented, it but the Italians spread it all over the world 😆 #LetsLaughABit #SpreadLoveNotFear #BeSafe #YoMeQuedoEnCasa
My mom who got back from the airport last night doesn’t want to self-isolate even though she has a sore throat. I am not pleased! #coronavirus
Currently discussing lettuce as a toilet paper alternative with my cousins in our group chat 😂😂😂🥬🧻 #coronapocalypse #Covid_19 #COVID19US #naturestoiletpaper #lettuceneverforgetI’m not a medical professional, but I have watched a lot of Greys Anatomy! 	I bet Bailey could find a cure for #COVID19 in a 47minute episode!
Most of the planet just learned how to wash our hands. I know we’re worried about toilet paper, but anyone worried about the global water supply? #COVIDー19 #coronapocolypse #coronavirus #panicshopping #toiletpapercrisis #ToiletPaperApocalypse
I feel like the #Coronavirus is a [test] to envoke fear into the minds of the masses to get people to take the #MarkoftheBeast.. or at least a way to move into the next phase of the #NewWorldOrder...
Black men can’t get the Coronavirus because his girl gone swear he got it from another bitch 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️😂😂	#COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdates #StayHome #Coronaviruscameroon
Hmm...to take advantage of cheap flights and take a trip...  Or sit at home and enjoy my abundance of toilet paper.  #choices #COVID19  #coronapocolypse
The liberal media should be ashamed for politicizing the #coronavirus to hurt their ideological opponents through lies when they should be informing people.  They truly are the enemy of the people and their shameful reporting is proof. #TrumpDerangementSyndrome #JournalismIsDead
Wash hands🖐 catch coughs 🤧 self isolate 🤒. 	This should help reduce  ~1000 global flu deaths per day (oh and ~50 global #coronavirus deaths too) 🤔
What’s really the truth about Covid19??? #COVIDー19 #coronavirus #COVID19 #COVIDCanada #COVID19Ontariowho's trying to come over so if we get quarantined you have to stay over.. #coronavirus
Someone tell the Indians using deodorant will keep #coronavirus away from them😐
President Macron of France has warned the French people not to go out or they will be punished and has put soldiers on the streets ! It’s like something out of a horror film . What are they not telling us ? #covidー19uk #CoronavirusOutbreak
Hear me out- weren’t people dying from a mysterious vaping disease a few months ago that affected the lungs? Is that still a thing too? #coronavirus
The worst part about this #coronavirus is my cable off 🤦🏾‍♀️
If u got infected with corona.Thats Ok. Don't panic. It can easily recover by eating healthy food and throw your fear into dustbin.Stay smile and face to the corona with big smile..#coronavirus will go out in 2 weeks from ur body if u face calmly.	#CoronavirusOutbreak #COVIDー19
These conspiracy theories about #coronavirus is making me think I’m in an episode of black mirror 👀
I'm seeing people referring to #COVIDー19 as the "Boomer Remover" #coronavirus is a whacky time period 😂😂😂25,000 People die every day due to hunger virus in the world, while its vaccine is called "food" but you will never see any debate on it in the world. 		Do you know why? Because no rich dies of starvation.		#coronavirus
Destroying the entire global economy because of the sniffles is the most 2020 thing ever. #COVID19 #coronavirus
At what point do you cancel your vacation and go back home...? after the safari  right? #coronavirus
At this point, I’m more worried about the COVID-19 panic than the virus itself. Everything is closing soon. Our society is overreacting to this virus. 	#coronavirus
Has anyone even thought about Cinco de Mayo?  America needs to eat tacos &amp; drink margaritas outside #coronavirus
Off to work on a train. Not sure if this is necessary travel? 🤷‍♀️ I'm guessing so since no-one is telling me otherwise. On the plus side it's nice and quiet for me to get some uni work done #whoknows #coronavirus
Does anyone else have Boomer parents who won’t take this virus seriously? It’s maddening! #coronavirus #boomerflu #babyboomers #socialdistancing #stayhomeQuarter teen and chill ? 🥵🤕	#coronavirus
Social distancing? It's not halal, let's go out in thousands and protest. 		#coronavirus #coronavirusindia #StaySafeStayHome #COVID2019 #AntiCAAprotests
No disrespect but is there a connection between #Kobe and the #coronavirus As in he didn't really die...like the Elvis conspiracy? Think back to what was going on January 26th. Weird but anything's possible I suppose or maybe I've got #cabinfever
Government forcing private businesses to shut down and/or forcing individuals to stay in their homes is tyranny whether there’s a pandemic or not. #COVID19 #COVID19ohio
Seen a tweet fae some dozy cunt saying China made #covid19 as a biological weapon.   Aye,  design a weapon that kills old folk.  Geez peace ya mangled fud!
I can be critical of the government at the same time comply with protocols. 		COMPLIANCE is different from BLIND AND SILENT OBEDIENCE. 		I ALSO do my part to help with GROUND OPERATIONS.		So yes, I have every right to call BS when I see BS. 		#Covid19
a note of caution for the ones that see the huge numbers of new cases in NY City: it is not because social distancing failed. It’s because we started testing on Monday! Expect to see further increase. Imagine if we were testing everybody as in S Korea! #coronavirus #NYCLockdownThink everyone just needs to sit back relax and say, Hakuna Matata🤷🏻‍♂️ #coronavirus
Keep sanity in mind. Do not let the government take full control. People have to work. The government can not support us all. If they could they would already be doing it. We're in extremely dangerous waters. Be brave. Be American. #coronavirus
This #COVID19 is gunna crash our economy &amp; civilization if it carries on for too long.		Those vulnerable should be isolated but everyone else needs to return to normality sooner rather than later
The world leaders probably couldn’t fulfill their vision 2020 promises so they created the #COVID19 🦠 virus to distract the world from asking the tough questions that’ll come sooner or later.The same guy who faked the moon landing must have produced the #Coronavirus hoax for the #Democrats because this shit is convincing as hell.
Stay in place orders in New York,California and now Illinois. What do they have in common ? Democratic states maybe? #MAGA #coronavirus #IllinoisPeople should be more worried about the financial collapse that will be happening than the #Covid_19 		A gun is better than no gun.
#Covid_19 #QuaratineAndChill daily sanity check... 		Around the globe about 150,000 people died yesterday		In the past 24 hours about 1,350 people around the globe died of Coronavirus		Less than 50 of those were otherwise healthy		Please stop with the hoarding and hysterics 🤯If I DONT get #coronavirus after ALLLLLL this bullshit, ima be mad af
I will never take your pills and I will never take your vaccines.   #Covid19In the end this virus will kill more businesses than people. #coronavirus #hysteria #facts
So in the US we had 80,000 people die from the flue last year alone. So we have a pandemic of 14,000 deaths GLOBALLY? I don't get it.  #CoronavirusEver more messages in my inbox from local companies that have to close, laying off workers and feebly hoping to reopen in the future.  Still not convinced this #coronavirus damage is justified. 	(no need to share your log-normal excel plots and 30 million dead scenarios)
No its not acceleratibg its a lie #CoronavirusWE ARE BEING ROBBED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT!		AGAIN.		AND WE ARE BEGGING FOR IT.		#Coronavirus = Annual Flu/Respiratory Illness + Media Hype		🤬🤮🤡🌎
Old Deer Park in Richmond is literally full of people "exercising" #COVID19 #ytho
Here's a truth you won't like.		This 'pandemic' isn't a real emergency.		It's a mild flu for 90% of people - most of who won't know they have it.		The biggest threat is the scum media whipping up hysteria.		#CoronavirusLockdown #COVIDIDIOTS #Covid19Out #21daysLockdown #COVID19New #Quarantine pickup line: "I'd risk #COVID19 to take you out."
I am sick and tired of all politicians trying to control oir lives. The only one in control of the World is God.  He knows when, how and of what we are going to die off, nobody else. The timing is only His!!! ✌💚🙇‍♀️ #COVID1932k cases in New York. Next highest state is under 3k. This isn’t an United States problem, this is a New York problem. Stop imposing New York methods on the rest of the country. #coronavirus #Covid19usa #COVID
All these attempts to control us and take our rights in the name of fighting #coronavirus will only awaken more people to their tyranny!  We Americans have never bowed to a disease or tyrants and we won’t start now!This staying at home not goin to work for me. #coronavirus #StayHome #lockdown #outlaw  #WashYourHands
Anyone who is having illegal get togethers during #COVID19 does not get a fucking ventilator
