This #COVID19 pandemic is not only wreaking havoc on the global economy and people’s lives. It also means more plastic and trash generated due to mask use, plus all the other medical and health equipment. 		😷😷😷
Many fans seem frustrated over cancelled sporting events OR played without fans. Remember, rather be safe than sorry with how contagious the virus is. 		Further, the owners are also likely more frustrated. Each cancelled game or without fans is massive revenue loss.		#COVID19

Now I wonder how they are handling #Covid_19. Travel to/from China is very common. Are they allowing employees to work from home? Will they see their policies are putting their employees at risk? Will they finally understand working from home is just as productive as onsite work?

My three year counting the #covid19 curve:	"1,2, A lot"	Sums it up really.	(Incidentally how he nominates how many pieces of cake he should get...)
#CoronaVirus has introduced exponential growth to the world. So why not keep it going: if you could fold a piece of paper in half as many times as you wanted how many folds would it take for the thickness to reach the moon? (Hint: what data do you need?) assume the thickness of
We have resources to fight wars but we don’t have resources for ventilators and PPEs. #COVID19
Corona Virus the disease that does not kill football players, basketball and actors and recover from it in three days 🤔 ?	#فيروس_كورونا #Coronavid19 #Coronavirus #COVID19 #corona #كورونا
Its a slippery slope for sure I can’t say it’s wrong but I believe everyone #old #young #underlyingcondition should be #resuscitated unless they have #DNR on place #COVID19 #coronavirus i understand its a difficult situation but its irreplaceable loss and a heavy weight to carry
So #COVID19 is not completely ruled out for me. Pneumonia is getting no better in current antibiotics. What does this mean for me. 		More meds and back into full blown quarantine again. 		Someone kill me please.
Who also heard the blast ? 		#TBJoshua #COVID19 #Asteroid2020
No offence but anyone quarantining down south with a pool at their house and 75 degree + temps can kiss my cold, pale, white ass! #COVID19 #CanadaCovid19
Quarantine 11 / 21: Worked. Went for a very long walk with Luna and Michael. Played Spoons and Smoke or Fire. Drank.		TP Count: 21* (we somehow acquired more)	Snack of the Day: Cookie and brownie		#COVID19

Folks....it’s very simple why the media and left won’t give Trump any credit. They can’t. They don’t want to lose an election in November. Their hate of the President is more important than the citizens of the USA. #COVID19
I don’t understand why so many deaths in Italy - seriously 		Do anybody has a serious answer ? 		#coronavirus #italy #wtf #sosad
Quebec really the type of people to have 400 #Covid19 cases today.		Should have let them leave when we had the chance.
The reason being quarantined doesn’t really phase me Is because during most of my junior and high school years I was grounded. I’ve trained for this like  it’s an Olympic event. #chynuhvirus #coronavirus  #iftheartofgettinggroundedwasasportingeventidbemichaeljprdan
Kamal hassan tested positive? 😮 #coronavirus
It took a Pandemic to realize how many things I took for granted #CoronavirusOutbreak
I can't wait for #Quarantine to end so my family can leave the house and leave me alone 😂🤷🏻 #Covid_19
It's REALLY bothering me how folks are using #covid19 as an opportunity to completely DESTROY an entire group of people just because they belong to a certain political party. This goes for both sides of the aisle.		STOP IT.	PEOPLE ARE SICK, DYING, &amp; SUFFERING.  	WE CAN DO BETTER.
....someone living on campus with me is presumed positive and decided to not tell anyone. Posted about it on fb, blocked a bunch of school people, and refuses to tell administrators or anyone else. I’m immunocompromised. I’m high risk. #COVID19
Anyone know what laws Governors are using to close privately owned businesses? Asking for a friend... #COVID19
