A couple thoughts on screenings:	1. While in Italy I was not concerned about #COVID19. I was concerned when we got on the plane and had no room to move. I went to the restroom after some lady that was coughing and had to use my elbows to operate everything (not that it helps).
This morning, I read that the cause of the Covid-19 outbreak is thought to have originated possibly from illegal sales of pangolin, a scaly anteater which is prized in China for its use in traditional medicine. How ridiculously ironic. 😡 #COVID19 #coronavirus #coronavirusuk

I am appreciative as a nurse for the appreciation. Yet still stunned. The NHS has served our country for 52 years. 52 years the NHS staff have been serving this country. Yet it has taken a pandemic to really show its value. #COVID19 #nhs #thankful #nurse #reflection #grateful
I wonder how many young kids now will grow up in 15 years and want to become a nurse or first responder due to the selfless act of all the nurses, doctors, first responders, &amp; medical workers who are working so hard to help #COVID19 patients. Like our generation’s 9/11.

As a citizen, it’s our right to criticize our country or government, but don’t be too negative &amp; full of hatred, esp. if you don’t come up w/ a better solution or idea! No system will ever please everyone, but do try to look for the good before you scream about the bad.  #covid19

Finished second day on the wards during #COVID19 a few observations:	-went from 1 COVID patient yesterday to 5 today. The floor that I have spent ample time on for the past 9.5 years has a dramatically different feel to it: no visitors, everyone wearing masks, and a somber tone

Before anyone sees the News or reads Tweets about the number of #COVID19 cases in America. Italy has a Population of about 61 Million and the US has a Population of about 327 Million. So Yes the MORE people get tested, the MORE cases we’ll have. Don’t be alarmed, be aware 🖤
