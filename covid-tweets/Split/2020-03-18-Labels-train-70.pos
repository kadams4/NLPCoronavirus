#CloseDaycares if the U.S. Surgeon General is telling our country to act like everyone has #coronavirus and to STAY HOME, why are daycares still open?! SHUT. US. DOWN.
Are people actually stupid for going on vacation during #CoronaCrisis, you are basically paying to go on holiday for lockdown lol 😂 Thank the Lord i’m not in Spain right now! #CoronavirusOutbreak
We  need to unite as a world to fight against this #CoronaVirus
My mom started chemo today. 		I've already urged her to make sure she stays home but I implore you all to do the same. 		Even if you think it's being over-hyped, staying home won't compromise your life like going out could compromise my mom's. #COVIDー19 #CoronavirusOutbreak
People’s selfish unwillingness to make temporary sacrifices to their lives will be the reason #CoronavirusOutbreak persists longer than it should, continues to hurt people’s ability to earn a living, and puts lives in danger.
In these times, selfishness becomes a form of selflessness. #coronavirus
2 folks  in my shop got tested (active duty sailors) yet they’re still walking around sniffing and hacking. My son just got over walking pneumonia, his immune system has got 2 be comprised. I’m beyond pissed. irresponsible of the navy. They should be quarantined.#Coronavirus
Time to head home, disrobe in the garage and scrub down in the shower after a day at the hospital #medtwitter #orthotwitter #COVID19
There are no words to express how much we appreciate our Healthcare professionals. Thank You! #coronavirus #COVID19 #NewOrleans #nola #healthcare #hero #pandemic
We live in a really shit time right now. Individualism is everything. It shouldn't be. Those with the means have stockpiled the essentials. Those who go from pay check to pay check are finding empty shelves. I really fear for the most vulnerable in society right now. #coronavirus
I hope everyone is staying save and remember we need to beat #covid19 together.
Today our ICU team sat for lunch together to debrief a challenging case. Challenging cases aren’t unique in an ICU specialized in liver dz, but they feel even heavier these days. We have no #COVID19 cases yet, but the uncertain future weighs heavy on our hearts and minds.
Close all schools? But let their parents go to work, use public transport, get the VIRUS and BRING it HOME.	Wow ☠ . 	How does that even make sense.		#CoronavirusInSA #COVID19SouthAfrica 	#Covid_19
I listened to my government officials, staying inside, only going out for necessity items and keeping a six foot distance from everyone. I’m still bummed out I couldn’t go out and vote in the Florida primary becuase I chose to listen. 😑 #floridaprimary #coronavirus
If the #coronavirus takes my life my friends and family know that I live a happy life...but if I am a carrier and affect someone’s life because I was selfish and stupid I will never forgive myself. Time to be smart. #SocialDistancing #selfquarantine #besmart
Something important to remember here is that OF COURSE confirmed cases are going to spike now that more and more people are being tested and results are coming in. Negative tests are also increasing exponentially. Numbers do not necessarily equal overnight spread. #coronavirus
I'm kinda glad so many NBA players got tested. Many positive tests with only a few showing symptoms shows how young people are far more likely to be carriers and not know it.  	#CoronavirusOutbreak
I’m trying to stay away from the public as much as I can. I have a compromised immune system &amp; my health is at risk. If I get sick, I probably won’t make it. This is all so scary. Please stay inside guys, this is serious. 🙏🏼😭 #Covid_19 #coronavirus
This is why public healthcare is so important. Health affects us all. People are going to go bankrupt getting treatment for #COVID19. Some people will not get treated for fear of the cost, and instead will infect others. #Medicare4All
I now watch tv shows and cringe at the sharing of drinks and shaking of hands 😣 #COVID19
to all the people who WONT quarantine themselves at home, some of us would like to return to our normal lives. Finish our senior year, finish our 1st year of college or to just go buy some flippin toilet paper. So please stay home. #coronavirus #COVID19 #stayhome #imisscollege
So people claim their children are their world, yet they are on vacation subjecting their so called beloved children to #COVID19 and then bringing it back and subjected others to it. You’re what’s wrong with America.
Be Safe from #coronavirus infection
#selfquarantine and #MartialLaw is the only way at current to extremely slow the #coronavirus ....whats your thoughts?
So i knew all this #covid19 was gonna eventually close down my job. But now that’s it has happened it’s so crazy. Everyone please stay inside so we can all go back to normal. And please do not fear God has us.
Fuck anyone making light of #coronavirus when HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS are losing their jobs. 	Fuck you. This is devastating.
Newsflash- people really don’t care about what’s going on. I’m curious how many people are off work, and just out and about enjoying their day off. GO HOME, GET BACK from me.  #Coronavirus
Great to see over due light shone on important sectors of Irish (&amp; Global) society during the #coronavirus outbreak. 		Heroes		-Nurses &amp; Doctors (inc retired ones coming back to help)		-Grocery sector workers - shelf stockers &amp; check out staff 		-The Gardaí		👨🏻‍⚕️👩🏼‍⚕️👮‍♂️👮‍♀️☘️		#ourbest
Let's #BreakTheChain to defeat #COVID19 	↔️ Social Distancing	✋ Hand Hygiene	🧹 Routine cleaning &amp; disinfect surfaces	📜 Be Informed	✅ Follow the instructions of health officials	Remember, we will overcome this. 	Share the word, not the disease.
From a healthcare professional: Be the break in the chain. Do social distancing. #WereInThisTogether #CoronavirusPandemic
People. Stay the F inside! What exactly are you doing?! This is all so god damn infuriating. #coronavirus
My wife, who has terminal cancer, Mom wants to come for a visit tomorrow with nieces and nephews. Given the circumstances with #COVID19, am I overreacting by being upset by this? #stayhomeCanada
Stay at home🏡 and stay safe. #coronavirus
Wash your hands, thank you. #COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #CoronavirusPandemic
If you think this virus is funny and/or nothing but a media scandal, YOU are the problem. Occasional, walk by stupidity is one thing. Willful ignorance is another. #CoronavirusOutbreak
Well its official, my fiancé and I are both laid off. This is heartbreaking and frustrating. #COVID19 is real. I hope people social distance themselves and quarantine if needed so this can end as quickly as possible! Even people who arent sick are being impacted in a very big way
Close the schools!!!	#CoronaVirusChallenge 	#coronavirus 	#coronavirusuk 	#CoronavirusOutbreak 	#ClosetheSchoolsuk 	#COVID19 	#CoronaVirusUpdate 	#coronapocolypse
Worrying to see so many teenager and young people gathering still outside local pubs. Learn from Italy and keep your distance #Corvid19uk #coronavirus #ringwood
I don't know who needs to hear this right now, but not everything going on at the moment is an overblown conspiracy 🙄🙄#coronavirus #2020sucks
I can’t wait for things to get back to normal, this whole #CoronavirusOutbreak is getting crazy. I hope everyone is staying safe during these dark times, sending my love and thoughts.
I have a friend who goes to the store everyday. I said how about limiting your exposure to #COVID19 by shopping once/week? He said, I'm not gonna get it. Does he know something, we don't know? #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID2019 #Quarantine
We must manage this pandemic with ‘wartime’ style leadership. Please everybody, follow the advice of the experts, have respect for authority and KEEP WASHING YOUR HANDS #covid19UK #coronavirus
I know people on holiday abroad rn, posting photos on FB.	I know people in the ‘vulnerable’ categories who don’t want to be hemmed in and told what to do 🤷🏻‍♀️#COVID19 #coronavirus
in all seriousness PLEASE remember to social distance in this crucial time. we all have a duty to work together to #FlattenTheCurve and prevent unnecessary deaths. #coronavirus #COVID19 #SocialDistancing
Not taking the necessary steps like France and Spain is putting lives in danger now. Who will benefit from a NHS crisis and charging it billions for rent of life saving equipment I Wonder?  #covid19UK #COVID2019 #coronavirus
Friends on my IG still partying up in Cabo. Laughing at having to self isolate when they get home. I hope you morons get stranded at an airport. You're selfish assholes. #COVID19
I’ve never experienced so much anxiety, fear, and confusion about my life. My wife does work but we depend on two incomes to survive. Please, stay inside if you don’t have to be out and wash your hands. Sorry for the long post, I’m just having a moment. #COVID19
Why do I have to choose between my health or my job? 	#coronavirus
Bout to let myself have an epic #hemiplegicmigraine and end it all before I inevitably get the #coronavirus when the hospitals are overloaded and they prioritize a healthy person over me anyway 😵💀
Sadly, The young generations are the silent carriers of #COVID19 and the older generation are the victims of it.
Hope for the best and prepare for the worst	#COVID2019 #workingfromhome #CoronavirusOutbreak
Just learned that the place I work has stayed open despite one of my bosses *testing positive* for #COVID19 and having significant contact with every single employee there.
I would also like to say a huge thank-you to all the medical staff and emergency personal that are out there doing what they do to save lives and keep people safe. I am humbled.#StaySafeStayHome #CoronavirusOutbreak
❗️IMPORTANT PSA❗️		We all need to be wiping our phones down about as often as we are washing our hands because we touch them so much they could potentially act as a reservoir for the virus. Use alcohol swabs/solutions that are at least 65% isopropyl alcohol.	#COVID19 #coronavirus
