For some of you, it’s still house arrest. Don’t pretend. #coronavirus
It is a thing of epic proportions that a marginal twist of the smallest of particles has shut down commerce, sports, and has the potential to overwhelm the best of our healthcare systems. Little things...don’t dismiss the little things. #COVID19
Cathy Go is pawer! ❤️ #ReignForever #VictoryWorship #COVID19
Prediction: at no other time will we see #wokeness like it than over #COVID19 in the UK press
Yesterday a Brexiteer was tweeting and hollering about how the UK isn't going to be at the back of the line and that being exempt from the US travel ban was a sign. Well. The UK and Ireland are part of the ban now... bet that tweet sounds really clever now, huh? #CoronaVirus
If Trump and co. Keep up this pace of in-action and refusal of affordable (free) testing/treatment for their citizens, id be more scared of people travelling to and from USA than anywhere else. Without the proper procedures the spread will continue exponentially.#COVID19
Flying today.	Enjoying watching people elbow bump, peace sign or foot tap to greet  friends and family!	#COVID19
I would like to say for the record that I successfully missed all panic buying. Beijing is the place to be for #covid19 I swear.
On #REFLECTION #2020 has been a shit year already. Countless #storms and bad #weather and now #COVID19 .
We are about to discover that lots of things aren’t necessary—- face to face college courses, office jobs, doctors office visits. Nearly everything can be done from home #COVIDー19 #coronavirus #CoronaOutbreak #SaturdayThoughts
Stage1⃣️ There is very limited infection, no need to worry, nothing going to happen. 	Stage2⃣️ Maybe something is going to happen but we should do nothing about it. 	Stage3⃣️ Maybe we should do something about it, but there is Nothing we can do.	👍🏼🇺🇸🇸🇪🇬🇧🇳🇱🇦🇺🇳🇿🇨🇦	#COVID19
After the Tory's won last election why are ppl surprised that there is much #selfishness in #UK. #COVID19
Shame on #VRBO Refusing any refund despite Disney World closing.  #coronavirus
What a time for our BT box to die! Please don't close the schools before we have TV 😂	#coronavirus 	#schoolclosures
One things for certain with the coronavirus and that's the exponential rate of people learning what exponential means. #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates #CoronaOutbreak
Fight with the disaster like #Coronavirus	CCultivate the habit of doing Namaste 🙏and say no to Shake hand 🤝🚫	Indian culture can neutralise such evil.	#ProudToBeAHindu 	#CoronaVirusUpdates
Think about this for a minute, there are millions of homeless people in America, who have no clue about the #CoronavirusPandemic since they don't have access to the internet. They are carriers and will spread the disease even more.
All media will run these stories in the next few days:	-Has #coronavirus killed the golden age of television?	-In despair X series has been postponed due to Coronavirus? Watch one of these 10 criminally overlooked streaming series instead!
If we vigorously attacked #Policing &amp; the #CriminalJusticeSystem like the #Coronavirus we could save over 1k Black and Brown bodies annually and #EndMassIncarceration in 2weeks with Sweeping Legislation. Declare #PoliceBrutality a National State of Emergency. #StayOnTheUpnUp
If a vaccine for #COVID_19 was available, it would be a reasonable policy to try and vaccinate 60% of the population to create herd immunity. 	To simply allow 60% to contract the disease is not herd immunity it's a mass epidemic!
Relationships are going to end. Relationships are going to get stronger. Hospital maternity units are going to be crowded in the November/December time frame. All because of this. #coronavirus
At the Monroe County #coronavirus press conference today, officials must explain why they kept crucial information from the public at their last press conference. If you told us half the story then, what aren't you telling us now? Transparency builds trust and confidence.
By Official Proclamation I am hereby banning all congregations near me in excess of 3 people. I am at the limit, so leave me the fuck alone. #coronavirus
This weekend, all social activity has been suspended. Absolutely, no social activity. No more social animal. It’s time to be advanced digital social animal.		#work8home #social #digital #COVID19
Question of the day: Is it really necessary to buy out all the toilet paper and soap? Makes them look like they’ve just inherited a P*rn collection 🤷🏻‍♂️😂 #coronavirus
I can't believe it. Leaned out of my window, delivered a perfectly proficient rendition of Psychosocial and nobody joined in.		You can all do one, neighbours. 		#coronavirus #coronaUK #COVID_19uk #COVIDー19
This pandemic is really bringing out the best in some and the worst in other. Hearing stories of people volunteering to do the weekly shop for elderly, followed by stories of people stealing hand sanitizer from hospitals. Absolute madness #coronavirus #Covid_19 #coronvirusireland
Can you tell I'm just done with the ignorance?  #COVID19
At the juncture of midnight today, the number of confirmed #coronavirus patients in #Pune district to 15 and that in #Maharashtra to 31. The total number of infected patients in #India has reached 102.
Anyone else got so good at washing their hands that their hands are now actually getting quite sore? #COVID19 #coronavirus #Covid_19
#covid19alberta 	#COVIDー19 	#CoronaVirusCanada 	#coronavirus 	For all the people i will see taking more toilet paper then you need I hope you can fight cuz you gonna  have to fight to keep your shit if I see it
Am I alone in thinking that jumping to conclusions from currently available data on #COVIDー19 &amp; estimating probabilities etc= dangerous because a)margin of error on available data is potentially higher than usual as b)#coronavirus =moving target with constantly evolving dataset?
Corona really messing with my money. Cancelled events for March and April. Thank god credit cards were made 🙏 #coronapocalypse #QuarantineAndChill #coronavirus #Covid_19
Do you remember when Biff from Back to the Future attempted to make a few dollars by utilising the futuristic Almanac? We can be like Biff, albeit not for gambling purposes, by reading the Italian and Spanish press. #ukcorona #coronavirus #COVID19
#IDTwitter looking for the best resources you came across on duration of respiratory shedding in confirmed #covid19 cases and on persistence of it on surfaces. Much appreciated. I'll start with one.
Please stop talking. #Coronavirus
Everyone is stocking up on toilet paper, but no one is stocking up on toothpaste or mouthwash. So you’ll have clean assess, but a dirty mouth? #coronavirus
I grew up as a homeschooler in the 90s... Basically, I’m professionally trained in this social distancing stuff.		#homeschool #90s #SocialDistancing #COVID19 #coronavirus
#CoronaVirus proves Levy will be with us forever until he dies or gets too old ... Levy is full of luck and this as mad as it sounds may have saved his season again.		#THFC
Stuck at home? Now is a great time to catch up on those home renovation projects. #toiletpapercrisis #covid19 #DIY #covid19Canada #covid19vancouver
I can't help but feel that this whole toilet paper shortage could've been avoided if the Three Seashells from Demolition Man had been invented #coronavirus
Could the #bachelor have ended at a worse time? Always fighting my #wife over the remote. Now no sports and the only thing on is the #news and #Covid_19
Buying all the items in high demand and selling them for high profit doesn't make you an entrepreneur, it's just makes you an asshole.   Don't get it twisted boo boo.  You're an asshole asking for bitch karma to pay you a visit #COVID19 #coronavirus
The idea of self quarantining for 14 days makes me a little giddy 😁	But then I remembered I'd probably have to quarantine the kids as well 🤦🏼‍♀️		#coronapocalypse #QuarantineAndChill #coronavirus #CoronaOutbreak #COVID #TeamSerranoTweets
Just started on my quarantine snacks. I’ll be out by Tuesday. #coronavirus
