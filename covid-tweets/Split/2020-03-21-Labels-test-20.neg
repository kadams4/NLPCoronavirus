Governement has been asking Canadians to come home and avoid unecessary travels, whatâ€™s the point of suspending international flights &amp; closing of boarders if Canada is bringing them home at this point!!! We have 1000+ cases in the country #COVID19
People should be more worried about the financial collapse that will be happening than the #Covid_19 		A gun is better than no gun.
