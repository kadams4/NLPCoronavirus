Ever more messages in my inbox from local companies that have to close, laying off workers and feebly hoping to reopen in the future.  Still not convinced this #coronavirus damage is justified. 	(no need to share your log-normal excel plots and 30 million dead scenarios)
Yall want me to preach "We over Me" now? But when black people are shot my police officers its "oh well lol" when poor people are kicked out on the street because they cant pay bills its "lol get a better job" nah fuck your elderly and fuck your fear. #Coronavirus
I’m thinking how did we get here? #COVID19 is brining the world to it’s knees and sinking it to a financial depression. I say it’s the news media with its fear mongering, promotion of hysteria, and their hatred of #realDonaldTrump
It’s no surprise that when the republicans need a distraction for their bullshit that trump says the dumbest Shit ever. #sideshow #ropeadope #distraction #coronavirus #letsOpenUpTheEconomy #DumbAssTrump
Wtf (what the flip) is this whole #coronavirus thing and why did it happen here
No its not acceleratibg its a lie #Coronavirus
