The air around the world is cleaner, less pollutants entering the sea, streets are less noisy. Families are spending time together, less planes flying around the world, luxury cruise ships are not dirtying up the sea.....#Covid19 - Just another perspective. 1/2
We are currently watching our sonâ€™s college team at Denison University streaming playing in the snow and cold. Best game on tv today! #COVID19 #MLB #NCAA #MarchMadness #BaseBall #SpringBreak #SportsRelief2020 #Denison
If #COVIDãƒ¼19 has taught us anything it's the lengths that people go to when desperate. Next time you judge migrants, refugees fleeing from war - Remember we literally fought over toilet paper. It's always "them", never "we". Introspection, fellas. Have it.		#Coronavirus #Racism
For someone who has family and friends in Italy, seeing the behaviors of some European governments is like watching a movie we know how it ends, while desperately screaming at the protagonists to do something. #Covid_19 #StayHomeBelgium #StayHomeEurope
If I get sent home from work for #COVID19 I might finally put away the clean clothes on the kitchen table
Awkward moment when British people don't agree with government how they deal with the situation but can't even protest cos mass gatherings are banned! #coronavirus
Iâ€™m worried that the US elections will be postponed over #covid19. Might seem crazy but the UK just postponed theirs
When the #COVID19 calms, how much food will be going to the tip cause 1) out of date 2) actually don't really like it just bought it cause everyone else was.
What are you supposed to do if you drool when you sleep? Asking for a friend. #COVID19
I think #COVID19 will reveal the best and worst of humanity.  #coronavirus
Going to use this extended break from school to take a deep dive into a hobby that my profession doesnâ€™t normally allow me to do-mustache growing. By the time the break ends I should have enough growth to keep people away from me for a considerable amount of time. #coronavirus
I was told yesterday that Iâ€™m not allowed to cancel the annual leave I have booked 6th-9th April (lead up to Easter weekend) because of the new #COVID19 rules at work (ðŸ˜¡). I now have no work NOR PLANS from 3rd to 13th April. What can I do, Twitter?!
