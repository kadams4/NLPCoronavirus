Going to Walmart...  plans for social distancing...		1. I ran 2 miles and not showering before I go.	2. If all else fails, I will fart.		S/N: Essential trip for prescriptions.	#dontjudgeme #istink #pu #covid19 #socialdistancefarts
"I think, in some respects, they welcome my voice out there telling the truth. I‚Äôm going to keep doing it. And no matter what happens to me, I‚Äôm going to keep doing it." - Dr. Anthony Fauci #fauci2020 #Quarantine #CoronavirusUSA #StayAtHomeSaveLives #scicomm #epitwitter
Ok. So we are self-isolating and staying at home, playing our parts. What's the government doing in their part - apart from quarantining? Or are we just gonna all come out of self-isolation in 2-3weeks, and boom! We were all safe again? #COVID19 #Coronavirustoronto
Distance is power against #COVID19!  #StayHome and do your part to help stop this thing in its tracks!  1st responders &amp; all those on the front lines need you to!  Feel helpless? Want to do something? THIS is how you will make a difference!  Be the example!
Really want to throat punch my brother and sister in law. They are not taking self isolation seriously, at all, and are endangering my nephew aka my favorite human on the GD planet. We're in Florida and most Floridians also aren't taking this shit seriously. #COVID19 #StayHome
The prices of lemon and ginger are going up. Who started this story that lemon and ginger cure #coronavirus infection?		Biko! Don't harm yourself with an overdose of lemon or ginger.		Misinformation can cost you your health.		#LockDownNigeria #COVID19NIGERIA #SocialDistancing
There‚Äôs nothing more profound than being part of something greater than oneself. I‚Äôm amazed by the courage, selflessness, &amp; determination of my fellow health care profs in battling #coronavirus . Every day we go to work is just as imp as every day that you choose to stay home. üôèüèΩ
God bless all our doctors, nurses and healthcare workers across the country caring for those fighting for their lives.		#COVIDActNow #COVID19 #lockdown #StayHome
As a germaphobic misanthrope, I feel like I‚Äôve been preparing for this my whole life.		#ontarioshutdown #COVID19
We can‚Äôt just give up on social distancing, but we can‚Äôt let the economy collapse. In cases like these, we need a strong, measured response from our government. #government #economy #COVID19
Yo I‚Äôm showing myself so much love right now.. I‚Äôm trying to get right for when quarantine is over! #coronavirus #COVID19 #QuarantineLife #LockdownNow #KungFluFighting #StayAtHomeSaveLives #WhereIsFauci
Some people just don‚Äôt get it! Social distancing means stay the fuck home and only interact with those in your immediate household and only go out when absolutely necessary. If you‚Äôre still going out to hang out with your friends to habe fun, you‚Äôre part of the problem!! #COVID19
