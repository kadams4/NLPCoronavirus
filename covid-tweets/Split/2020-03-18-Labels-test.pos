I listened to my government officials, staying inside, only going out for necessity items and keeping a six foot distance from everyone. I’m still bummed out I couldn’t go out and vote in the Florida primary becuase I chose to listen. 😑 #floridaprimary #coronavirus
Worrying to see so many teenager and young people gathering still outside local pubs. Learn from Italy and keep your distance #Corvid19uk #coronavirus #ringwood
We  need to unite as a world to fight against this #CoronaVirus
I'm so sick and tired of that bitch Rona. She's taking our happiness and making it her ownnn. She is squeezing the life out of older folks and dividing us. She is disturbing our work and taking away our day to day activities. Let's pray away this bitch #coronavirus.
It's killing me that there is no basketball🏀, there is only so much Net flix and 2k one can play. Prayers 🙏🏿up to everyone that died from the covid19, and to everyone effected. #covid19UK #coronavirus #COVID2019
We must manage this pandemic with ‘wartime’ style leadership. Please everybody, follow the advice of the experts, have respect for authority and KEEP WASHING YOUR HANDS #covid19UK #coronavirus
Sadly, The young generations are the silent carriers of #COVID19 and the older generation are the victims of it.
