I'm I only one who isn't panicking an thinks this is all a bit much? Also check out the new powers the state has given itself of the back of the #CoronaCrisis #Covid_19 #coronavirus
Covid-19 i gonna leave more people bankrupt and dead from suicide (when people lose their job, savings, home) than actual deaths from the virus...		#COVID19 #Corona
My father is 67 years old and is still going to work every day! #realmvp #Covid_19
#coronavirus conspiracy theory:	- people of 70 years and older are the most exposed to be dead from #Corona 	- their children are 40-50 years old and these people vote	- if parents die, children are pissed off and no votes	- hence - fight #coronavirus!
The same guy who faked the moon landing must have produced the #Coronavirus hoax for the #Democrats because this shit is convincing as hell.
So..... is there more to this than ‘they’re’ letting on? #coronavirus #CoronaCrisis
Stay in place orders in New York,California and now Illinois. What do they have in common ? Democratic states maybe? #MAGA #coronavirus #Illinois
Take the #coronavirus seriously, but don’t lose your mind over it. 		While some people are vulnerable to it, yes, 90% of people that catch it will make a recovery without a problem.
