the US is handling this #COVID19 so poorly
Deciding not to care for the elders? It seems unreal, a b horror movie. It breaks my heart. Can‚Äôt even wrap my head around it. #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #ItalyCoronavirus
I understand schools/companies need to shut down due to the #CoronavirusOutbreak but i cannot afford to live if I am not able to work
Guys lot of countries are under lockdown. Its time we fill up our refrigerator with food, stock enough groceries and disinfectants for home. Shortly we are going to get 2 week work from home notice #coronavirusindia #pandemic #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus
It‚Äôs 2 am and I can‚Äôt sleep because I‚Äôm worried about the #CoronavirusPandemic
Really hoping this ends! Horrible times. #ThisTooShallPass #CoronavirusPandemic
1/x Tips for coping with #Covid_19 anxiety. 1) take good self-care measures for health 2) wash hands regularly per CDC guidelines 3) limit social media use &amp; checking the news (ex: no more than 30 min a day, or check news once a day) 4) avoid ritualistic behaviors #CBTWorks
Is money really more important than peoples lives? Surely the sooner everything is shut down the sooner #COVID19 is stopped. I‚Äôve heard so many pompous medical professionals say we‚Äôre so much better prepared than in Italy. Really? #pillocks
Wow...Tom Hanks &amp; Rita Wilson test positive #COVID19
300K people have been tested in China	200K people have been tested in South Korea	9K people in the US. Gross negligence by this administration and we have been failed yet again. #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID #pandemic #CancelEverything
Does anyone know if Las Vegas is open I'm pretty sure that the casinos are a breeding ground for the #COVID19
Many crucial moments have come and gone in the decision timelines of world leaders. As the mounting data suggests, most countries have responded with too little, too late. Perhaps it‚Äôs time for a data scientist as president. #CoronavirusPandemic #Wisdom #dreaming #COVID19
This is getting crazy... #caronavirusoutbreak please stay safe all! Look out for yourself and those around you! #staysafe #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVirusUpdate #coronavirus #BREAKING #crazy #
If your home is on fire, do you complain about how it started or do everything in your power to put it out? #Covid19 #CoronaVirus
Schools should be closed. Period. There was no snow, so I know y‚Äôall got those snow days in your pockets. Unless y‚Äôall want bodies dropping like flakes. #CoronavirusPandemic #CancelEverything #CloseTheSchools
Virus carriers may not show symptoms of #Covid_19 for as long as 14 days, and in the meantime they‚Äôre potentially spreading germs. The bottom line is that this is such a new virus, there is just a lot we don‚Äôt yet know. I‚Äôd rather err on the side of caution to protect our public.
Aware of the panic and all about the likely lockdown--It would do everyone good if we not only think of our own health, but also of the welfare of our families and communities. We might (unknowingly) spread the #COVID19, so please avoid travelling.
This day, and more broadly this period of time, are historic. This is an event that will be remembered for the rest of our lives and then some. #Coronavirus #COVID19
All you Spring Breakers, stay safe and don‚Äôt bring anything back to the 806! As far as we know, Lubbock is coronavirus-less. But that could all change in a matter of weeks. #COVID19
The USA is still taking a reactive approach the #COVID19 instead of a proactive approach.  Communities need to be tested immediately.  Containment should be implemented across the board, meaning the public needs to immediately take measures to stop community spread of the virus.
So even if the flu is worse than #Covid_19 it‚Äôs still killing people today!? What kind of argument is this?
#COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #coronavirus I personally think that maybe all the affected countries should stop flights coming in and out of the country until they can contain this deadly virus ü¶†
It is the time to do more now so we can do less better later. #Covid_19 #covid19SA
If you say the coronavirus is dumb or over talked about then you need to educate yourself! It is still a deadly virus!ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Man people these days are... idk if it‚Äôs the things happening in 2020 is worse or the people! #Covid_19 #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic

Be kind to one another, especially in the workplace. Every combination of constraints &amp; concerns will be encountered. Some people will need to WFH, and need support with that. Others' work necessitates being on-site, and they need support with that. Extend your empathy. #COVID19
#Trump should be preparing hospital beds instead of banning travel to #EU. 	American healthcare system will not be able to care for the sick	#WorstPresidentInHistory		#CoronavirusPandemic

IF IN DOUBT?		GET CHECKED OUT!		#cornoravirusuk #COVID19 		If not for yourself, but for every child, parent grandparent, uncle or aunty who could catch it or pass it on to someone vulnerable
If #COVID19 was studied &amp; controlled back in Nov-Dec last year when the doctors 1st raised the issue instead of them being censored &amp; prosecuted, none of this would be happening.We are all suffering the damages caused by Chinese gov. #HumanRights #FreedomOfSpeech #CensorshipKills

They‚Äôve found they Coronavirus can have strong symptoms in some, and hardly any in others. Some have none, but can still give it to others. Testing shouldn‚Äôt have to be a last resort at this point. #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus
BREAKING: Twitter orders all its employees to work from home.	#CoronaVirusUpdate #COVID #CoronavirusPandemic
When I tried to alarm people around me because I saw how bad it was in China two months ago. They say: don‚Äôt worry that‚Äôs China. Now: WORSE than China in every aspect. Still ü§¨ how everywhere else has extra months to prepare and now it‚Äôs pandemic. #COVID19 #COVID2019NL
