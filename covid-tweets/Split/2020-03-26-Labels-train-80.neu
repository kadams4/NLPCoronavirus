Trump calling this the ‘Chinese Virus’. All he’s trying to do is denounce China, to give it a stigma so that the USA will be the superpower. Dangerous game. Dangerous game. 	#coronavirus

WHAT A JOKE! the Senate's bill still has $25 million for the Kennedy Center. What a relief to the small businesses going under because of #COVID19.

Weeks ago, we were sending our Chinese friends our best thoughts and wishing them safety and health as they worked from home during the partial factory shutdown. They're back at work, and wish the same for us. There is a sense that we're all in this together. #coronavirus

If Trump supporters are so convinced he's doing a wonderful job:		How do they explain why so many medical personnel don't have enough PPE?		Why can't they explain why Trump said there's no problem for 2 months? 		Or why he then said he knew there was a problem long ago?		#COVID19
The death toll keeps rising. And it is becoming unbearable. #COVID19

I hope Trump’s apathy and incompetence in handling #Covid_19 leads to thousands of lawsuits. He deserves it.

This novel #coronavirus is twice as infectious as flu and 15 times more likely to land you in the hospital.
So I probably have #COVID19. I’ve got a warm enough forehead that feels like a fever. I’ve been coughing and sneezing like cray cray. My nose is still stuffed after sneezing. My chest feels like it’s compressed and hard to breathe in. I’ve been told I’m better off at home. AMA
Just accidentally topped up my vodka with more vodka instead of sprite #Quarantine #coronavirus
The entire humanity should isolate china, "they are the virus". No one should have trade relationships with them. They should be taught a lesson.	#IsolateChina	#ChinaVirus	#Covid19	#coronavirus

Scared about losing your insurance if you get laid off because of the #coronavirus pandemic? Relax! There's a law called COBRA that lets you pay even more for the same insurance while you're unemployed and not making money. It's a beautiful thing!

What are the Constitutional implications of suspending all criminal jury trials in the wake of #COVID19? Are the accused just sitting in jail indefinitely awaiting trial? Is there a provision that allows the courts to force them to wait because of a crisis? #QTNA
Since the beginning, experts have stated the United States was roughly 10 days behind Italy. If this still holds true, we are in for a rough couple weeks. We need leadership and understanding. We need, honestly, some civility and empathy. We just need to be better. #Coronavirus
