Why do #COVID19 testing results take so long? A person very close to me got tested this week, they told her 2-6 days for results in the meantime she’s locked at home with her immediate family-she’s very very sick! #SMH #IDontUnderstand #ThisIsNotAHoax
now i’m starting to hear about people i know dying from the #CoronavirusPandemic. this is getting terrifying. #Covid_19
Every employee of every company should be asking their leaders what their company can do to help #Covid_19
I'm fed up with owners of businesses coming on tv/radio moaning about #coronavirus We're in this together Dudes!
Some of y’all don’t know how to properly quarantine and it shows #COVID19
Get your gas mask ready guys #Coronavirus
We all do better when we work together, even when we are apart! #CoronavirusPandemic #QuaratineLife
In a couple of years time, someone with will calculate the number of people that lost there lives to Coronavirus, by keeping pubs open for 6 hours longer... #BorisJohnson #COVID19
Here’s a tip if you insist on going to a supermarket and queuing up. Place the length of the trolley between you and the person in front of you. That’s a nice distance so you at least put yourself at least risk. #SocialDistance #Covid_19
I wish for a state enforced curfew for the young and foolish #Covid_19 #CoronavirusPandemic
I will block all people who actually believe #coronavirus is just a hoax or 'fake news'. The surge is yet to come in the UK and when it does I think we will see how unprepared our underfunded NHS is after ten years of tory cuts. #StayTheFHome #covid19UK
This is my week off.  It’s causing me more stress I think sitting on the sidelines. I am ready to get in there and serve. No identified cases in our county. #Hospitalist #COVID19
...take this message to heart Share it with your parents, kids, friends &amp; family: The actions we take today will determine how many people our hospitals can treat, how many lives they can save &amp; how long this pandemic will last. #COVID19 #SocialDistancingSavesLives
y u shouldn't shake anyone this period:	The #COVID19 is transmitted through Resp droplets; Most people cover their mouths with their hands when they cough or sneeze which would obviously be contaminated with RD afterward. This droplets can be transferred during a handshake...
How many people world wide will have #COVID19 and never be tested? How many people will die without testing? The numbers we see are only a fraction of the reality. #WhereAreTheTests
Lots of people on road. Vehicles are less in Delhi. Not everyone was wearing masks. Was on Lodhi Garden road. Dating was going on, they dont seems to care about #coronavirus #WuhanCoronavirus #ChinaVirus
Need to hammer this home: LITERALLY ANYBODY CAN CATCH THIS VIRUS! Stay safe.#CoronavirusInSA #COVID19
Careful and rational are synonyms not antonyms. Tell your friends. #COVID19 #SaturdayThoughts
Love seeing these commercials for restaurants. You can order meals to go. It will keep these business a live and keep some people still working earning a paycheck. Be safe out there! #CoronavirusPandemic #StayAtHome
