I will block all people who actually believe #coronavirus is just a hoax or 'fake news'. The surge is yet to come in the UK and when it does I think we will see how unprepared our underfunded NHS is after ten years of tory cuts. #StayTheFHome #covid19UK
Having two people in the house at Hugh risk is sending me into a constant panic. #covid19
China being a dictatorship and a much advanced nation than us took months to recover(god knows true or false) from #Covid_19, India with huge population where none follows rule of law and where the PM is "urging" people to be seld quarantined and stay home, Gods save us!
It's time to #LockDown #NEPAL #Coronavirus #covid19nepal
I wish for a state enforced curfew for the young and foolish #Covid_19 #CoronavirusPandemic
Stay home #coronavirus
Keep safe everyone. Let's pray for one another in this trying time. üôèüôèüôè	#COVID19	#StayAtHome
#CoronavirusPandemic 	I think Gov.DeWine has waited too long to shut down the city. 159 yesterday, 247 today and how many more before the end of the day?
Observations: Older / at risk not getting the message. Couples walking round Tesco, too close to everyone. No concept of keeping back at counters or tills. And bizarrely, parents with children going shopping? Why? Lock the country down, some people can't be educated  #Covid_19
It‚Äôs a massacre in Italy among the elderly born before 1940. They were kids playing when the bombs were falling during the war, the ones that built our Republic. We need to find a way to protect them. Other countries should do the same to shield that precious generation #COVID19
J &amp; I hopped in the car to get out of the house and just drive around. I am honestly shocked, and truly disappointed to see how many people are still out. Target, sure. But Best Buy and Hobby Lobby?! WHY?!! People need to wake up and take this serious. üò∑ü¶†#StayHome #coronavirus
I'm fed up with owners of businesses coming on tv/radio moaning about #coronavirus We're in this together Dudes!
Thanks to #AmazonPrime and #Netflix which give lots of different things to enjoy in such situation.. A very nice solution to fight with #Covid_19.. Enjoy the shows, stay at home, stay healthy and stay safe.
Watching tv right now is so weird. The ads were made b4 #Covid_19 and are pushing trips to Vegas and selling things that are so not necessary... not that they really ever were b4. But still, it's super surreal.
Put Gauteng on LOCKDOWN!!		Tough decision bt it is needed to prevent this #Coronavirus from spreading all over SA.		Once thos get to over 1000 next week it will be difficult to contain.		Leaders pls take unpopular decisions that will save SA lives.		People before profits
Careful and rational are synonyms not antonyms. Tell your friends. #COVID19 #SaturdayThoughts
It still amazes me the stupidity of human beings !	Open your eyes folks people are dying, do what your told by the government and do your bit to help the country through this pandemic. Its not much to ask really üá¨üáß ! #Covid_19 #covid19UK #covid19scotland
I‚Äôm seven weeks pregnant and completely anxious about this virus. I‚Äôve been staying inside my house for the past six days. Avoiding everyone but my husband. üò¨ #Covid_19
Like how terrifying is this knowing your father is coming home after seeing dozens of fever, coughing patients when the govt can't even provide safety equipments for the med staffs. I'm not OK:/	 #COVID„Éº19 #CoronavirusPandemic
