#coronavirus question for people smarter than me: is teleworking going to do us any good if we're still expected to be in the office one day per week (despite being perfectly capable of doing our jobs from home)?
I’m seeing a lot of tweets implying that the insurance sector is lobbying government for inaction on #COVID19   If this is true, shame on you all.   Life is precious not a commodity 😡.
Homeschooling gives you a headache? You still haven’t got the vaguest idea of what #teachers do for your kids	 #education #coronavirus
How are grocery stores open and allow the employees to be surrounded by the mass lines and overcrowding. Then when I get sick everyone’s gonna be shocked.  Them stores should be closed like everything else ! #corona #RonaVirus #QuarantineLife #COVID2019 #CoronavirusOutbreak
God spray us with your super sanitizer.... #CoronavirusOutbreak
All my efforts to avoid contact of face with hand are sabotaged by  phone. Now putting all calls on speaker or requesting for messages. Old phones with handle was lot more hygienic #COVID2019 #COVID19india #coronavirus
Ha. So I guess there actually is such a thing as a "book emergency". #stillworking #bookselling #RetailWorkers #canadalockdown #COVID19
Or they'll get fired for just not showing up to work... That's where I'm at. I touch money, come into contact with TONS of people but I can't get fired. Not now.		That's why I'm not shitting on people for not staying at home: I'm angry at the #government.😑		#COVID19	#Coronavirus
Why is #ResignBorisJohnson trending..... fkn Morons he is following the advice of fkn experts not... Keyboard warriors or piers Morgan and the constant Doom &amp; Gloom the BBC are doling out 24/7 .... #BackBoris #coronavirus Keep Calm and Carry on !!!👍🇬🇧
I canceled on my date today bc I was gonna go on a date with someone else and that someone else ended up canceling on me... LMAO now I’m straight up alone... maybe for the better #coronavirus
I guess isolation after RAI for cancer was like practice for this shit #coronavirus
#corona its time war , get it and wait for it or stay a way of it 👌🏻 #كورونا #COVID-19 #Coronavirus
Any Youtubers vlogging their COVID-19 experience? #coronavirus #COVID19

I never really fully understood the value of public health until now. #COVID19 #Coronavirustoronto #Coronavirusontario
I know I’m retweeting a lot of #coronavirus stuff and it’s because this is so scary. I went to the store and all the shelves were empty and i couldn’t touch anything. If you get the Coronavirus, I really hope you survive and be well. This is really scary 🥰🙄
Slightly bemused by people promoting more extreme measures for the community, yet posting pics of close social contact events at the same time? #wtf #everyonesanexpertNOT #COVID19
It makes me so mad to see any politician use this virus as a political ploy, especially our president.Also, our president had the nerve to call COVID-19 the China virus. What a disgrace of a human. Never been so ashamed to be an American. #COVID19
Pro Tip:  try to get away from the news/spend SOME time each day doing something that has nothing to do with #coronavirus
