Is anyone in the general population reacting a normal amount to #coronavirus ?	Like not making it a complete joke OR buying 8 packs of TP.
So, stay indoors for 14 day, I probably won‚Äôt get paid for it, but I understand. But wait, this thing is world wide in warm weather climates, so it probably won‚Äôt just go away. And everything I‚Äôve read says you can keep getting it. I‚Äôm fine with a quarantine, than what? #COVID_19
All UNR classes moved online following our spring break. This is a good move by the university! Thankful to work for an employer who values us and our students, and recognizes this situation for what it is: an emergency. #COVID19 #UNR
So we‚Äôve decided to cancel the birthday party for our lil princess üë∏üèª. 		It‚Äôs ok we can do it next time ya baby girl. 	#Covid_19
This seems extreme but it's effective in stopping the spread of the virus. I'm going crazy tbh having my freedom taken away but what can ya do. Just letting you know that this might be your situation also..hopefully not, just be prepared. #coronavirus
Any Medical experts out there? If you contract Covid-19 today, when next season arrives, can we get it again? #Coronavirus #Covid_19 #doctors #nurses
Message to the general public: STOP BOOKING FLIGHTS AND TRAVELING. #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaOutbreak #coronavirus
Let me just take this moment to say that if by October you think the #CoronavirusPandemic will make a great Halloween costume, it won‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt even think about it.
I‚Äôm not worried about #coronavirus. I‚Äôm worried about the economic downturn that will result from it.  	#Covid_19
Can't stop thinking that there are actually still people who believe the #coronavirus is a hoax. Just boggles the mind. 		I guess these are the people that still believe #Trump &amp; his band of incompetent turds.		IMO Trump is toast this Nov.		#LiesKill	#JustTellUsTheTruth
Hey people, no need to panic. Just practice proper hygiene. If you have a chronic illness, stay away from people. Don't visit our seniors in long-term care facilities. They're vulnerable. JUST USE COMMON SENSE and stop hoarding TP and Lysol wipes. #Covid_19 #CoronavirusPandemic
Guys, we have to stop looking to our federal government for answers. There are none. If you can, stay home. Keep your kids home. Build your immunity. 		This is a great time to develop your hustle. #CoronavirusPandemic
#Coronavirus y‚Äôall need to stop buying everything. Some people actually don‚Äôt have anything yet. I have been looking for hand sanitizer and masks for over 2 weeks now, and still everything is always outta stock. Get what you really need. Don‚Äôt take the whole store. üòïüòïüòï
The conference I was meant to go to in a couple weeks has been cancelled because of #Covid_19 		However it‚Äôs likely for the best, as my family are part of the high risk populations. It‚Äôs not worth the potential risk from being at a large and international event
Churches in U.K. are still gathering despite churches in America live streaming services and many large public gatherings globally being cancelled. Why are they not taking the safety of their congregations seriously and acting now? #CoronavirusPandemic
I‚Äôm worried about my ability to pay a security deposit when my current lease ends. I‚Äôm losing my health insurance, I‚Äôm worried about affording my prescriptions. I‚Äôm so. F*cking. Angry.		/2		#CoronavirusPandemic 	#CoronaOutbreak
We are in a pandemic!! Stop stressing about your vacations being cancelled and worry about your safety! Your life is worth more than a theme park!! #Disneyland #DisneyWorld #coronavirus
The #coronavirus might pull us apart physically for now. But as a people this should not be who we become in the long term. This too shall pass. Fear can sometimes feel stronger than Hope. But Hope overcomes all.
So my midwife recommended that I stay home from work immediately because apparently I actually do have a compromised immune system due to being pregnant. This now has me so much more paranoid about this virus üò©ü¶†üò∑ #Covid_19
Y‚Äôall		It‚Äôs time to set aside the political stuff. 	It‚Äôs time to set aside the hard feelings. 	It‚Äôs time to realize the next couple of months will be weird. 	It‚Äôs time to come together and ride this rollercoaster together and try to get through this the best we can. 	#Coronavirus
Well, batch 2019-2020 had the worst possible school ending through out the past years. Hopefully this will all end soon and everyone will be safe :3 	Just a reminder to everyone to wear masks if you‚Äôre sick and drink lots of water while having vitamin C.	#Covid_19
I'm angry and sad ...how selfish you be?  Why aren't you taking this seriously? You are putting others at risk! Be diligent! Wash your hands, keep a social distance and *please* don't travel! #airhugs #caringisnothsharing #COVID19 #covid19Canada #CoronavirusPandemic
The real reason #Floridians won‚Äôt take the #coronavirus seriously...because we‚Äôve been conditioned by hurricane season to have trust issues #lockdown #CoronaOutbreak #floridaman
Stay hygenic everyoneüôèüèªüß¥ #Covid_19 #CoronavirusPandemic #ManilaLockdown
Stay safe and healthy! #CoronavirusPandemic
With a global health crisis like this, now is not the time to argue and panic. Now is the time to pray and work together. #coronavirus #Catholics
Will the coronavirus keep you from going out to eat?? My answer is yes #coronavirus
I think the uk does need to go on lockdown for at least 7 days...		Clearly the virus can‚Äôt be contained...		Work should pay there staff wages through sick leave. 		To many lives at risk here		But then how will you even survive? How will low income families find it? #Covid_19
While people are out there hoarding toilet paper, I‚Äôm over here worrying about our country having another Great Depression. 		Let‚Äôs do all we can to support independent businesses, our communities and most of all other humans. #bekind #CoronavirusPandemic #comminityfirst #love
I am talking to so many people at work who have #COVID19 symptoms who are being told they will not qualify for testing for various "reasons." They're told to self-quarentine by their Dr's. We truly dont know the extent of this because of the lack of testing!
Im one of those Americans who cannot afford to miss work if I do I won‚Äôt be able to eat or pay rent. I also am In an industry where I touch people for a living. #MedicareForAll #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #CoronavirusPandemic #PaidSickLeave
Better to overreact and laugh about it later than to underreact and mourn #CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19 #CoronaOutbreak
So after hospital duty, I must change clothes (scrub suit )first before leaving the the lab. This way is to protect the world, the universe rather! #COVID19
#Covid_19  isn‚Äôt just a meme anymore, if not contained the ageing population are under serious threat
#CoronavirusOutbreak is real. People need to be cautious. Be aware. #Listen
Just a reminder: please be kind to your health care providers #CoronavirusPandemic #fluseason #overwhelmed
Stay home if you‚Äôre sick! #CoronavirusPandemic üò∑
buy#face masksÔºådonate to your frontline doctors and nurses, also the elders,it is hard time, N95 can protect them form #CoronavirusPandemic #COVID2019uk #CoronaOutbreak #Corvid19
Pandemic #coronavirus will give us a great lesson that we are weak creatures, but also the strogest ones as if we unite and hold on all together.		Our enemy is not between us, but something outside humanity which actually we ourselves have made.		Stay strong!
You can literally hear the gears of society grinding to a halt #coronavirus #COVID19
Has anyone else had extremely frustrating conversations with their parents in the past 24 hours in which it becomes clear how incredibly un-seriously they are taking #CoronaVirus precautions?
Don`t panic but take it seriously. Let`s fight both the virus and the anxiety. We all wish to stay home but life must go on. Protect the entry points. All the more your hands and your soul. Also sentido kumon. #Covid_19
This isn‚Äôt going to end. 		Whether it‚Äôs #coronavirus or not, this is our new normal. We must create compressive global health policies and address the inadequacies that greatly affect poor and minority people. This is a climate change issue. A human rights issue. And so much more
The reality of what is being faced by many families as a result of the coronavirus pandemic is tragic. We will continue to pray for the health, safety, and protection of people around the world and for our Bahamaland. 	#COVID19 #Praying #uniquecouples	#Bahamas #grandbahamastrong
Can‚Äôt believe people right now. Stop hoarding. Stop panicking. Stop taking masks away from healthcare workers. Wash your hands. Do your laundry. Clean your counters. Just stay home and wait this out. And please stop thinking you‚Äôre invincible!! #Covid_19
The government needs to act! stop nonessential travel, shut schools and universities, close sports events and music festivals. We need to learn from Italy or suffer the same fate #Covid_19
