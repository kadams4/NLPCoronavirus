#COVID19 alot has to be said for the way the media portrays the news in such events. Releases &amp; headlines should be vetted to curb the propaganda.  The resulting situation of the economy caused in part by #coronavirus is going to be far worse than the problem we are trying to fix
I refuse to panic about #coronavirus until itâ€™s death count surpasses the Clintonâ€™s
Iâ€™m not at all worried about getting sick from this stupid #coronavirus but I am worried about businesses closing, events getting postponed, supplies running low and all these crazy changes that affecting everyoneâ€™s lives
Fear of economic slow down due to corona virus supersedes all other major events like subprime crisis, note bandi, Greece and Brexit etc		Is there a real problem which market is trying to discount or its panic? Only time will tell.		#Markets #marketselloff #Covid19
Iâ€™m so annoyed with all the celebrities asking everyone to stay home until things get better! Itâ€™s easy for them to do it, not for the rest of us who donâ€™t have the means to do so.	#coronavirus #celebrityannoyins
The weekend is upon us &amp; I am itching to go out since I was responsible due to #COVID19 last weekend. I wanna have a social distancing happy hour with my neighbors but they old as fuuuuck ðŸ™ƒ
You can literally create a flu by yourself just by thinking about it.. 		These spin doctors know all about the laws of attraction &amp; that's the weapon they are using against humans, an attack on their biology via consciousness information manipulation.	#COVID19	#CoronaVirusUpdate
People are taking this thing way too seriously it's getting out of control. #coronavirus #COVID19 #ChineseVirus
If I hear one more person start their press release/email/meeting with "it's business as usual" I might just lose it. 	I don't care where you are or what you do, nothing about this is "usual".		#covid19 #flattenthecurve #stayhome
Carona is a perfect example of International Medical Scam.	Beneficiaries top pharma companies.		More Deaths, More Fear, More Profit.		Guys stay safe, do not overspend on masks and sanitizers. 		#jaishriram	#Carona 	#coronavirus 	#COVID2019 	#CoronaVirusUpdate 	#Quarantine
The #pandemic is the panic , not the #coronavirus  #COVID19
Instead of "#flatteningthecurve" and prolonging our misery, let's just "rip off the band-aid" and get this over with! Long term stressing of hospitals is worse than a short term spike. And it's killing the economy. #COVID19
Hi virus,	You will never be able to touch me 	#COVID19
