Touch base with elderly neighbors and friends during this time of #COVID19 ...they may be anxious and/or afraid to ask for help. And when this has passed, keep the connection going ðŸ’ž
14-day LOCKDOWN	Stay safe beautiful people. Good health is wealth. #Covid_19
As of this Saturday, they're closing Disneyland, California Adventure Park and Universal Studios Hollywood. I guess it's no joke right now. #CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19 #COVID2019
My body went through a lot with chemo/radiation. Since then, I have ridiculous immune reactions when exposed to the simplest things. I break out in a rash every time they flush my port (with saline only). Yeah, Iâ€™m worried that getting #Covid_19 would be particularly bad for me.
They believe up to 10,000 people are probably infected even though only 590 cases have tested positive. This means other countries should be wary of their actual numbers. You can only find positive cases of #coronavirus if you test for it!
We have to pray and unite as one during the  #CoronavirusPandemic. When schools close, some children will go hungry. When places close, some people will not get paid. We need to support and love one another.
Our hearts go out to everyone - in all walks of life, and all across the world - whose lives have been turned upside-down by the #CoronavirusPandemic.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you all in this difficult and uncertain time. #StaySafe #CountYourBlessings
It is not the time for Republican vs. Democrat. Lifeâ€™s are at stake. It is up to Congress and the President to make sure ALL Americans are safe, protected and taken care of from this pandemic. Stop with they petty Social justice BS. #CoronavirusPandemic
I for one am looking forward to hunkering down with my family for awhile. Weâ€™re lucky enough to have our health and a big family that all gets along. We may not be together like this 4 long. 		We will happily do our part to protect those at risk. 		#covid19 #pandemic #ShutItDown
Why are people not taking Corona Virus seriously? The mortality rate of infected of 5%  or more in Italy is staggering! 	People don't realize how dangerous it is &amp; even if you get over it can scar you for life (literally) or you can spread it to your family members.#Coronavirus
Just Bc COVID-19 might not concern you, does not mean that it canâ€™t kill your loved ones who have autoimmune diseases, respiratory issues, etc. so please, just wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water. A lil hygiene wonâ€™t kill you. #CoronavirusPandemic
right now with the #CoronavirusPandemic i ask you to check in on the ones most marginalized because they are the ones being affected 		* ALSO REMEMBER WE KEEP US SAFE*
