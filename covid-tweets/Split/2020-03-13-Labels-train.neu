Following #SportRelief for a brief respite from #Covid_19. So lovely to see all the great ways that people -esp. school kids- are coming together &amp; doing daft &amp; dazzling stuff to raise ££ for fellow human beings. World needs empathy, kindness, collective action more than ever.
Now I wonder how they are handling #Covid_19. Travel to/from China is very common. Are they allowing employees to work from home? Will they see their policies are putting their employees at risk? Will they finally understand working from home is just as productive as onsite work?
#Covid_19 is doing everyone dirty. #Bitcoin is also feeling the heat. What a nose-dive! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
latest news, earth is suspended #Covid_19
Health cs mutahi kagwe is definitely well versed with  business of governance, just listen to the incompetent of cs macharia very clueless and inept, not forgetting the incompetent cs Sicily kariuki.#CoronavirusPandemic #BBINonsense #CoronaVirusUpdate
What #coronavirus needs is nannyMcphee that bitch fixed everything. 😫
Fuck #Covid_19
Can Twitter create a #Coronavirus tab and move all related tweets out of normal timelines and into a special section? It pays to be informed, but this is becoming way too much. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
I never knew you could eat toilet paper, or wipe your bum with pasta. #Informed #Coronavirus

The stock market crash isn't due to #covid19.  It is due to our goverment's failure to provide guidance and leadership. #maddow

If anybody needs water go to bjs. Idk about y'all's but our store was hiding the water in the back by the tires. They were real petty on that cuz we went to the store today &amp; yesterday. Had to buy the more costly, nasty water yesterday #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic #COVID19
Just wondering if #coronavirus could shut down businesses, why can’t it shut down sallie mae . Rona needs to have a conversation with sallie mae cuz uhmmm. #salliemae

What is sweet is sweet!	What is bitter is bitter!	Now, it's bitter for Nigerian politicians to travel for medical check up and functions.	#CoronaVirus~~~kolo werk🙆🙆🙆
Just got word that the Forsythia Festival is cancelled this weekend because of #coronavirus ...I’m getting worried now. Really needed this festival financially right now. Have full time employees to pay &amp; bills to pay. Ok. Now I’m scared.
#cryptocurrencies are not a safe haven asset nor a disaster hedge they are a trading tool. The #coronavirus has made this quite clear and my thesis saying otherwise has been proven irrefutably wrong. With that being said we are buying equities at our target entry prices.
SEC fans don't care until effects football games #CoronavirusPandemic #SEC #Alabama #Tennessee #Florida #Georgia

And yet another Premier league player tested positive for COVID-19 😬 Wonder what genius thought it was going to be a good idea to continue playing at the weekend #PremierLeague #COVID19
Since everyone trapped inside, 3 things will increase. 	#1 Fights: From not use to being home together	#2 Pregnancies: For the same reason and lack of other activities 	#3 Weight: Eating and walking, running, and sweating (except for #2) #CoronavirusPandemic #lockdown #Covid_19
Can we cancel bills indefinitely too? #Covid_19
You want to know why #Covid_19  makes me anxious? Because asshats are emptying the grocery stores in panic, while I just need to shop and feed my family. Rows of bread, meat, canned goods, Mac and cheese all gone. #panicbuying is not how we face this as a nation.
Immediately the president announced that there is 100 million to spend on coronavirus they have  found a case in Ghana. Criminals!!!		#coronavirus #Covid_19
You know this is bad when #ShopRite is trending 😞 #CoronavirusPandemic
I am thinking non effected games will go ahead this weekend due to fans having travel plans. Then that will be that for the foreseeable. Euros will be moved back 12 months and the season will reconvene and run through when euros should of been on.  #SCFC #Covid_19
Any golf courses having cheap rates during #CoronavirusPandemic? I am down to play alone everyday until this gets contained. Quarantine me there!
I fucking hope that Bat on a stick tasted nice.... #COVID_19uk #CobraMeeting #coronavirus

It is with a heavy heart that I have to announce the cancellation of my 10th annual St Pattys Orgy this weekend. I am being told that having 40 consenting adults in one basement during the #Covid_19 pandemic would be irresponsible. #toughdecisions #orgy
Who would have thought we were all taking toilet paper for granted this whole time? 		#CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19
Nothing like the #coronavirus to shine a light on modern day peak capitalism #NotMeUs
There is only one sensible thing to do. Call this season null and void and hand the Premier League to the team with the most titles #coronavirus
Russia has been suspiciously quiet over the #CoronavirusPandemic the biggest country in the world, and not a murmur? Or have I missed something?
Only 287 panic-buying days until Christmas! #Covid_19
we have not yet asked Quiboloy about the #COVID19
So I heard if you hold your breath for 10 seconds and not cough that’s how you know if you have #coronavirus or not 🤷🏾‍♀️
