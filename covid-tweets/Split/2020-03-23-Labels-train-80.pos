Those who are privilege enough to sustain their daily needs in a month or even months of being quarantine, all of their worries are that they are bored, want to go outside, meet their friends, travel etc. #COVID19PH #Covid_19
Expectation: Help 3 and they'll help other 3	Today's Fact: By staying home you can help many. Spread happiness not virus. #covid19 #stayhome #gocorona
Hopefully people have got the message. Sadly, there will still be the minority that think this is all a joke #COVIDIOTS #StayAtHomeSaveLives #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus
Now have clear evidence from Italy that shutdown works. US would have egg on face if Europe contains and we let it go crazy. Need full country quarantine for two weeks and then back to business. #coronavirus #covid #RightWingMinorityOpinion

Guys keep social distance and support government with #lockdownindia.	#StayHomeStaySafe	#fightagainstcorona #COVID19
Good morning - happy Monday and have a great day :-) brilliant to see the community spirit spreading let's make sure that's the only thing that spreads - if you're delivering stuff to the vulnerable we have some protocols we would be happy to share!! #COVID19 #community
(WHO) has warned that the #COVID19 disease pandemic is "accelerating", w more than 300,000 cases now confirmed.		It took 67 days from the first reported of Covid-19 to reach 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000, and just four days for the third 100,000.	#StaytheFuckHome
If we are to learn anything, it should be these things: 1) when the WHO, the CDC, every doctor and nurse and government official ask you to stay indoors and shelter in place, you do it; and 2) which toilet paper brands you will never, never, ever buy again #coronavirus
My pre-shift download yesterday. Preparing wills and decontamination routines. We need worker protections for healthcare professionals as well as all front-line workers who will keep us all safe during this outbreak. #StayHome #COVID19 #GetMePPE
Please stay home if you can and stay safe everyone!! We‚Äôre all in this together!! 	#coronavirus #COVID„Éº19 #CoronavirusPandemic #SocialDistancing #StayAtHome #FlattenTheCurve #GroceryWorkers
It‚Äôs time for a (inter)national lockdown before it‚Äôs too late!!  #CoronavirusPandemic #lockdown #SundayThoughts #QuaratineLife #COVID„Éº19
you‚Äôd think the NHS that everyone is praising at the moment would atleast provide doctors and healthcare nurses with clothing that reduces their risk of catching it but nah they expect my mum to continue working.. whereas the logic? #coronavirus #COVID„Éº19 #NHSstaff
Do not listen to politicians who recommend drugs for a disease. Listen to the doctors. Listen to the experts. #Covid19 #Coronavirus #LKA #QuarantineLife #Quarantine
Republicans are acting like socialists with massive government handouts, but Nancy Pelosi put an end to it. What timeline are we living in? #CoronavirusPandemic
The best way to approach social distancing is to pretend like you already have the virus.	#COVID19NL #COVID„Éº19 #covid19 #COVID19
Honestly don‚Äôt think Boris Johnson was specific enough #coronavirus #HalfLockedDown

Canada needs to go on a total lockdown now. Clearly we are showing we can‚Äôt follow instructions. This is what governments do...look out for people when they need help. Well we need help. Shut everything down. #COVID19
Everyone has this #BillionDollarQuestion when would this #CoronavirusPandemic ends?? The answer is us.. We have to #StayHome #SocialDistancing and #behealthy ..	By following the instructions from the #Government we can #SaveLives of who is getting affected to #COVID„Éº19 #staysafe
If you can't help, don't hurt. If you can't heal, don't harm. If you can't harness, don't harass. If you can't bridge, don't breach. Keep others safe and stay safe. #socialdistancing #COVID19 #coronavirus.
In Bangladesh our hospitals are not even checking patients properly.despite of 30+ deaths social media is not revealing,there‚Äôs no kit in the hospitals to check patients.government is not locking down country.dont how will we end up!! #coronavirus #Bangladesh
Stay where you are.		Because of this Curfew/Lock down people are fleeing to their natives.		This will increase the spread from metropolitan cities to rural remote locations.		Kindly don't act as carriers and take this virus to the rural areas of the country.		#Covid19	#Corona
People please stay at home. #coronavirus

By all means stay safe. Let's stop the spread of the #Coronavirus. It'll take individual effort to fight this and yes, we will win this fight together.

#BREAKING: A woman in her 30s has died in the City of St. Louis from #COVID19. This is the first death in the city. This is again a reminder that ANY one, of ANY age, can be impacted by #coronavirus.

Why is nobody asking questions from Modi on how India, a country of over a billion people, is going to survive this pandemic?		In our city #coronavirus transmission is already in stage 3 (community transmission).		In couple of days transmission numbers will be in thousands üò∑
Than I was standing) 	Laughing and joking. 		Look I know #coronavirus is for real and older people are more susceptible to the worst symptoms but that was pretty crazy. I hope that lady stays healthy.

This is #WW3 except it's not a fight for the militaries, this time it's the health care professionals fighting this battle. We keep the them all in prayers and those who are affected üôèüèæüôèüèæ #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronavirusOutbreak
Just arrived at Gatwick from Sri Lanka (essentially a third world country) their measures against #coronavirus are infinitely better than ours on the basis ours don‚Äôt exist. Tells you all you need to know about Gov attitude to this. UK need to wake up fast!!
Once it is safe to do so, every big city should hold ticker tape parades for its health care workers after we beat back #coronavirus .  HCWs will be the true heroes of this battle. #COVID19 #StayHome
Who wants to protest against Boris Johnson where everyone is 4 feet apart üò≥. Less lives would of been lost if he went into lockdown weeks ago. #LockdownNow #COVIDIOTS #COVID„Éº19 #fuckboris #StayAtHomeSaveLives #coronavirus
Thanks to all of the dozy c***s who thought social distancing advice didn't apply to them. This is why we can't have nice things like trust and some level of freedom. Not because *we* can't. But because *you* ruin it anyway. 	#COVIDIOTS #coronavirus #StayAtHomeSaveLives
Let's keep our minds, hearts,and spirits strong let's exercise all parts of ourselves. Y'all stay safe. #COVID19 #MondayMood #StayHome #SocialDistancing
The problem with this country, is that we don't take anything seriously. We didn't take Brexit seriously, we didn't take the general election seriously, when voting. Now, we don't take #COVID19 seriously. Wake the fuck up people - this is not a joke! #StayAtHome
Thanks to massive bunch of ignorant cockwombles we‚Äôre now not far off being on lockdown! Hope your moronic &amp; selfish picnics, gatherings &amp; lack of attention to the govt‚Äôs advice was worth it! TAKE. IT. SERIOUSLY! #SocialDistancing #covid19 #ConsiderOurVulnerable #ActResponsibly
The response to COVID-19 has only showed me that the US and UK safe like the two kids in the class always getting in trouble and getting detention because they don‚Äôt listen #medtwitter #COVID19

I'm super impressed by my little brother. Crazy times and he has just got on with it! Done his school work from home, followed what people have told him to do with distancing, no complaints at all! If an 11 year old can do it you can too! #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus #homeschooling

If you have to work go to work then go home. If you need groceries go get them then go home. If you need medicine go get it then go home. If you need...wait...want to hang out with friends, don‚Äôt. Stay home! #coronavirus #StayHome #SocialDistancing
I woke up 3 times in the night, once to check I‚Äôd text all of my team! I had, I knew I had but I am a born worrier. #coronavirus #support
Some people be taking this #CoronaVirus serious on social media but when u tell them to cover their mouth when they cough in public, they wanna fight.
Health care workers are out here risking their lives and they can‚Äôt go home. We are asked one simple thing, to stay at home and you‚Äôre out roaming the god damn streets thinking this is a fucking vacation! #COVID„Éº19 #StayHome #CoronavirusPandemic #HealthcareHeroes

I have already called it for weeks. You can ban football matches but it wouldn't make a difference if the public transport is still running. The reduced services makes it worse when more ppl are packed in trains running at lower frequencies. #COVID19 #UKLockdownNow
Honestly, no one is taking any notice of staying in. I thought the elderly were not allowed out? They‚Äôre out in droves. It‚Äôs the old fuckers that are spreading it. They think they‚Äôre immune #shamblesstayathome #Coronavid19 #coronavirusuk #COVID19 #coronavirus
