I understand schools/companies need to shut down due to the #CoronavirusOutbreak but i cannot afford to live if I am not able to work
Hey, *45, the noise is coming from inside the house. 👏MAKE👏TESTS👏AVAILABLE👏 Test anyone and everyone who needs it. Release real numbers. Share real information. Lives are at risk. Listen to science. Stop the nonsense. #COVID19 #TESTVIRUSNOW
This past week has literally felt like a nightmare. #CoronavirusPandemic
(2/3) Maximum cases are people with a travel history to infected countries and ofcourse Italians. 65 infected and 0 deaths for a billion people is simply amazing statistics.		Can someone figure out why the #CoronavirusOutbreak hasn't hit India as hard as other nations?
I really need to know the situation at the US border campa regarding the #CoronavirusPandemic Weren't people dying of the flu there already? What's going to happen to these people now??
If you say the coronavirus is dumb or over talked about then you need to educate yourself! It is still a deadly virus!🤦🏻‍♂️ Man people these days are... idk if it’s the things happening in 2020 is worse or the people! #Covid_19 #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic
