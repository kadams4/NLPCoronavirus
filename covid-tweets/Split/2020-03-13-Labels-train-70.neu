You want to know why #Covid_19  makes me anxious? Because asshats are emptying the grocery stores in panic, while I just need to shop and feed my family. Rows of bread, meat, canned goods, Mac and cheese all gone. #panicbuying is not how we face this as a nation.

Russia has been suspiciously quiet over the #CoronavirusPandemic the biggest country in the world, and not a murmur? Or have I missed something?

Can Twitter create a #Coronavirus tab and move all related tweets out of normal timelines and into a special section? It pays to be informed, but this is becoming way too much. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️

I’m hungry af but scared to eat at these restaurants 🤦🏾‍♀️ #coronavirus
Now I wonder how they are handling #Covid_19. Travel to/from China is very common. Are they allowing employees to work from home? Will they see their policies are putting their employees at risk? Will they finally understand working from home is just as productive as onsite work?
Is #coronavirus trending only in my TL ?
We can’t make the same mistakes! #CoronavirusPandemic #listentoitaly

I am thinking non effected games will go ahead this weekend due to fans having travel plans. Then that will be that for the foreseeable. Euros will be moved back 12 months and the season will reconvene and run through when euros should of been on.  #SCFC #Covid_19

Following #SportRelief for a brief respite from #Covid_19. So lovely to see all the great ways that people -esp. school kids- are coming together &amp; doing daft &amp; dazzling stuff to raise ££ for fellow human beings. World needs empathy, kindness, collective action more than ever.
#cryptocurrencies are not a safe haven asset nor a disaster hedge they are a trading tool. The #coronavirus has made this quite clear and my thesis saying otherwise has been proven irrefutably wrong. With that being said we are buying equities at our target entry prices.

So #jaslok just took my 2week travel history and all personal details at entry. This is all too real! 🙊 #coronavirusinindia #CoronavirusPandemic
