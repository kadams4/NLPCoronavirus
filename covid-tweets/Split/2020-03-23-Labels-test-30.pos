I'm super impressed by my little brother. Crazy times and he has just got on with it! Done his school work from home, followed what people have told him to do with distancing, no complaints at all! If an 11 year old can do it you can too! #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus #homeschooling
And in #India nearly 17-18 million people died during the #SpanishFlu in 1918, which was almost 6% of its population. Highest among the nations. Think about it, #staysafe and #StayHome. #COVID19 #WHO #lockdown #CoronavirusOutbreak #pandemic
