To the asshole who showed up to our store wearing a mask and pretending to cough whenever you walked by somebody: fuck you. Go home. The #coronavirus isn't a joke. If I wasn't required to work, I'd be home self distancing.
Calling all cyclists out there. Now more than ever we need to stick together, respect one another and remain positive. These tough times will pass and we will ride shoulder to shoulder again #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus #KeepCalm
And w/the official pres address we‚Äôre off to the races w #CoronaVirus in SA: school closures, gatherings limited to 100, &amp; encouragement to stay home as much as possible. Worried for the underprivileged as they live day to day and can‚Äôt afford to not work. ‚ù§Ô∏è
If you‚Äôre self employed, how worried are you about your job and income?  #CoronaVirus
People need to be doing less worrying about why their child‚Äôs school isn‚Äôt closing &amp; more worrying about the zero discussion of testing and treatment. The virus has already spread.		#coronavirusaustralia #coronavirus #covid19 #COVID19Aus #ScottMorrison #scomo #auspol #Australia
I am not concerned about my recovery if I do contract #covid19 I am concerned about the rapid spread to others who cannot fight this disease. We need a shut down period. 		I also don‚Äôt want to go to work tomorrow. üôÇ
Maybe it's not all about how to not get infected by #COVID19. Just assume you're the carrier so you should lessen your touch to things, your travel, and contacts with people to slower the spread and no more COVID19 left in the world since the virus only have days to live.
