Iâ€™m in Beaumont hospital and youâ€™d think it would be chaos but no. Itâ€™s a GHOST TOWN. 20 odd people in A+E the night I came in and only 6 people last night. The wards are empty. Unheard of.	Theyâ€™re prepping for all of youâ€™s dopes that went out the weekend ðŸ˜‚ #covid19 #coronavirus
Iâ€™ve got #toiletpaper ðŸ§», who wants to trade? #coronavirus
Whoever tweets #OCoronaKalAana will not be affected by  #CoronovirusPandemic. This is the cheapest solution poor and needy can afford as masks and sanitizers are beyond their earnings.Any opinion fellow indians #coronavirusindia #CoronavirusOutbreak #IndiaFightsCoronavirus

Good movies on quarantine: Alien, 28 Days Later #coronavirus #StayHome
