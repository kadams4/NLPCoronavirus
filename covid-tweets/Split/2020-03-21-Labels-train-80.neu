Who knew 2020 would be like this? 2019 was such a great year that we all thought it would  just continue on. In a matter of 2 months, #COVID19 changed everything... around the world! Billions of people affected. We will survive this I'm sure. Daunting. But we'll make it.
If you’re looking for something to watch during #Covid_19, I highly recommend Star Trek. Amazon Prime has TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY, and ENT. All told it’s 27 seasons (average of 26 episodes each), or 500+ hours!

In the instance of a widespread #CoronavirusPandemic, Nigerians would take their chances. Stay at home to prevent being infected? Or go out to find food for survival? 	The rich would go with the former, the middle and lower class would go with the latter. Lockdown or not.
