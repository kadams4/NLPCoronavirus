Once we flatten the curve, people will loose that awareness of basic measures to protect themselves like washing hands, keeping distance, etc and this will result in another curve just like what Britain is experiencing.	#COVID19
And while we're at it, stay away from grocers, bankers, and whomever else is still open if you're sick. Because we can't afford to get sick either, and just because you're sick that doesn't mean it's okay to fuck with us. Eat shit if you do.	#COVID 	#coronavirus	#lockdown

At the current time the #UK is still in full exponential growth of #COVID19. However it locked down so in 2 weeks it will begin to slow. Please, all people worldwide, please enter full lockdown. If we ignore lockdown, we will have at least 20% mortality, 38% next year.#extinction

The USA now has more #COVID19 cases than any other country, despite the fact that in most states getting tested is still extremely difficult. The real number of cases is so much higher...		Why aren‚Äôt we all in lockdown?? This is beyond ridiculous and irresponsible. #LockdownUSA
Also to anyone chasing, use your head Saturday. With everything going on with #COVID19 and the possibility of this being a bigger day, I expect a lot of people to be out. Don‚Äôt gather in large groups and continue to social distance.
Why do so many people think that CLOTHES SHOPPING at Target for 20 minutes is essential right now?? üò° #coronavirus
