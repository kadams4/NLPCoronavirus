We re actually practicing physical not social distancing.We re more socially connected during this crisis, tks to the Internet,sharing tips &amp; links to entertainment &amp; books,playing group games &amp; having virtual parties &amp; most importantly reaching out to those in need	#coronavirus
The hardest part of this virus is the fact that I live with roommates who don’t take isolation seriously and I can’t afford my own place. Is anyone else dealing with this?? #coronavirus
In New York City alone, there are over 300 members of the police force with COVID-19. Hundreds more are waiting for tests reports NBC #FirstResponders #covid #coronavirus #stayathome #SocialDistanacing

Also, to those idiots who refused to stay home for spring break bc you planned it for so long, I don’t feel sorry for any of you. At this point, that’s just natural selection. #COVID19 #SocialDistanacing #CongratulationsAmerica #springbreakidiots #dontlistentotrump #StayTheFHome

Tonight, I had to censor somebody from my life. Which is okay, because he is really dumb and doesn't think Covid-19 is real.		#fernandoaponte #coronavirus #covid19 #unitedstates #tennessee #nashville #nashvilletn #popmusic #instagay #lisaney #usnews #Tennessee #unitedstates
Day 3... unlike yesterday, today I woke up with an existential question..	What am I doing in my life? Why can’t I help? 	#COVID19 #AcademicChatter #phdchat #phdpandemic #SatyHomeStaySafe #depressedashell
Living room is set up for crafts in the morning. 2.30am and I evidently can't sleep. Routine is right out the window 😬 #COVID19 #coronavirusuk #SocialDistanacing
Once we flatten the curve, people will loose that awareness of basic measures to protect themselves like washing hands, keeping distance, etc and this will result in another curve just like what Britain is experiencing.	#COVID19
And while we're at it, stay away from grocers, bankers, and whomever else is still open if you're sick. Because we can't afford to get sick either, and just because you're sick that doesn't mean it's okay to fuck with us. Eat shit if you do.	#COVID 	#coronavirus	#lockdown
People suffering from Cardiovascular or  Chronic Respiratory, Diabetes, Hypertension and Cancer,	SHOULD STICTLY avoid public places, to be on the safer side during #COVID19 health calamity.		#CoronavirusLockdown #CoronavirusOutbreak #IndiaFightCorona

How about lockdown by phone number. Or ID number 	For instance: cell/ID numbers that end with 1-3 get one day to shop etc	Permission is via SMS, one line per person. The tech exists #CurfewinKenya #COVID19
Curiosity kills the cat, but ignorance kills humans. Please stay at home. #COVID19 #coronavirus

A couple of sobering facts:		1) If you die of COVID-19, you die alone with carers dressed in spacesuits! 		2) You get buried in your pyjamas or your hospital robes! 		3) Healthy, young people are NOT immune!		Now STAY THE FUCK INSIDE!! #coronavirus #StayHomeSaveLives
So the United Stares has taken the lead in top number of coronavirus cases. We make up ~16% of the reported cases in the world. Even though we only make up ~4% of the world’s population. But y’all wanna continue hanging out and not social distancing. #coronavirus
I feel like I haven't done anything but mope. It's the least I can do--&amp; stay home. #COVID19
My work is all over the place. As is my family. Everyone is hit in their own way. My daughter asks me when this will end. I thank my stars she hasn’t asked me how this will end. I have resolved to stay positive. #coronavirus #CoronavirusLockdown
I would trade my hazard pay, 80 extra sick hours, overtime pay in a heart beat for this #coronavirus to end I'm grateful for the job I have I just want this to end So please stay home you humans. &amp; stop over buying stuff we have enough food and TP Its hard to keep up w/ everyone
At the current time the #UK is still in full exponential growth of #COVID19. However it locked down so in 2 weeks it will begin to slow. Please, all people worldwide, please enter full lockdown. If we ignore lockdown, we will have at least 20% mortality, 38% next year.#extinction
The United States now have more positive #COVID19 cases than any other country in the world. More than 82,000 cases and over 1100 deaths from it.  Remember that's only the people that have been tested. There are many more that are untested. #StayHome

Honestly what I get from the daily #COVID19 briefings is: because Americans basically cannot understand.  This is a bad bad bad flu.  Sir your ass in your house.  And lock the Gd Door.
Prayers for each country, each individual and families tonight. Stay safe, practice safety. Sending out energy, light and love	#CornavirusOutbreak #COVID2019 #StayHomeStaySafeSavelives #coronavirus
Didn't realise #contagionmovie was on TV tonight. Watched it on dvd.	Scarily accurate. #coronavirus 		Same advice: social distancing.
Yo as a New Yorker I feel like the coronavirus is not even real half the time but I’m just saying it’s probably a government experiment trying to one up us like we still got you ha ha April fools bitch‼️ #COVIDIDIOT #coronavirusmemes #coronavirushoax #coronavirus #lol #justplayin
We are also on the brink of running out of large volume pumps for medication infusions. Our bed capacity has been increased by 50% and everyone from the front lines &amp; those behind the scenes are exhausted. Please stay home if you can #CoronaVirus #COVID19
In a rogue #coronavirus #StayTheFHome move I decided to stay home and touch my face! #IsolationLife #haventbeenoutsideindays
We all have a national tragedy we remember from our childhood...I'm sad my children have this to remember. Having to explain to them why they can't go to the fence to say hi to the neighbors really blows! #coronavirus #SocialDistancing

I want desperately to be able to DO something to stop #COVID19 . It's so frustrating that the best way to help is to just stay home.
-Self isolation Day 6-		Wife: "I'm just gonna watch you and eat corn"		#SelfIsolation #COVID19
I worked out 3 times today, but I also ate a pint of ice cream, a party size bag of flaming hots, 4 black bean patties, 6 eggs, and 2 protein shakes. #SocialDistancing #coronavirus

Today the US was named the country with the most confirmed #COVID19 cases in the world. And there are still way too many American people who don't get that this is serious. It defies logic.
Y'all this Corona virus got y'all acting like selfish fools!  Can't even find rubbing alcohol!🤦 Stock piling everything and I bet you fools are still out and about in the public! 🙄🙄 #annoyed #overit #COVID19
COVID-19 was named that because we’re all going to gain 19 lbs from sheltering in place at home. #CoronavirusOubreak #CoronaVillains #COVID2019 #StayHomeSA #coronavirus

After watching Little Women, Emma (2020) and Emma (1996), on three consecutive nights and loving them all, I seriously need my pre-#COVID19 life back!!! #FlattenTheCurve #StayHome #JaneAusten #femaledirectors
The USA now has more #COVID19 cases than any other country, despite the fact that in most states getting tested is still extremely difficult. The real number of cases is so much higher...		Why aren’t we all in lockdown?? This is beyond ridiculous and irresponsible. #LockdownUSA
Also to anyone chasing, use your head Saturday. With everything going on with #COVID19 and the possibility of this being a bigger day, I expect a lot of people to be out. Don’t gather in large groups and continue to social distance.
Why do so many people think that CLOTHES SHOPPING at Target for 20 minutes is essential right now?? 😡 #coronavirus
I’m tempted to just go drive around and park and sit in the parking lots of stores and watch YouTube videos of people shopping in those stores... #COVID19 #QuarantineLife
