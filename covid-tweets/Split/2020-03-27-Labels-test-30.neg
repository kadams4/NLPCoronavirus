32k cases in New York. Next highest state is under 3k. This isn’t an United States problem, this is a New York problem. Stop imposing New York methods on the rest of the country. #coronavirus #Covid19usa #COVID
All these attempts to control us and take our rights in the name of fighting #coronavirus will only awaken more people to their tyranny!  We Americans have never bowed to a disease or tyrants and we won’t start now!
