I am not at all thrilled with Japan’s response to the #COVID19  pandemic. Apart from the closing of schools, it is business as usual... packed malls/bars &amp; crowded trains. Testing is hard to come by. Only govt facilities offer the test but only if high fever for 4 straight days.
For those parents out there that think it’s ok to let their kids play out whilst the schools are closed, YOURE ALL FUCKING IDIOTS!!! It’s not an extended holiday. It’s to keep them away from other kids to stop the spread! #coronavirus #schoolclosuresuk
#SocialDistanacing only seems to apply on my day off. 🤔 #LockdownLondon #StayAtHomeChallenge #Convid19uk #COVID19
Long distance relationships are hard anyway, but when #COVID19 stops you from seeing a loved one for potentially months on end, it gets pretty darn miserable. Be thankful if you’re isolated with your loved ones.
#COVID19🦠 🏘	Quebec’s gvmt asks us to limit our travels w/in the Belle Province. I know, it’s difficult. But, there’s 1 goal: SAVING LIVES. Let’s take advantage of 📱💻📞 to share, catch up and stay in touch!Although we’re physically isolated, we’re in this #together #polQC
We call on the international community to intervene to protect the Palestinian prisoners from #coronavirus by taking preventive measures recommended by WHO.	#SavePalestinePrisoners
#coronavirus is worser then we think I’m telling youuu😩😩
It's my humble request to all the citizens of India, if you have any symptom of #covid19 like cough,sick or sneezing.	Plz quarantine yourself and keep your loved one and nation safe🙏 #coronavirusindia
If y’all don’t keep y’all asses inside, drink some damn moonshine and shut the hell up. 🙄		YES, I am taking this virus very serious. 	NO, I’m not about to lose my mind over something I’ve already been prepared for. #COVID19
Palestinian political prisoners are held inside closed and crowded Israeli jails which would increase the possibility of being infected with #coronavirus. #SavePalestinePrisoners
It's time for the Canadian government to announce complete lock down in the country. Amazed to see people that are supposed to self quarantine are not taking enough precautions and visiting restaurants, banks, and grocery stores.	#COVID19ON #COVIDCanada  #COVID2019 #Covid_19
I’m glad grocery stores are making accommodations for the elderly and other vulnerable members of our communities. I’m saddened that they have to do so because members of our communities are too selfish in their panic. #coronavirus
The fact that my girl had asthma got me stressed out more bout this #COVID19
I have all the symptoms of the #coronavirus (I feel absolutely dreadful &amp; yes I’m self-isolating) but how do I know that it’s not just the flu? I quarantine myself for 2 weeks and then head back out into the world to only catch something I thought I’d already had? #COVID19
We must be mindful that we don't exacerbate the barriers to healthcare for people who are vulnerable and we support everyone to remain included in our new distanced society		Very proud of the Irish response so far in this situation 🇮🇪 everyone is being so helpful 🤗		#Coronavirus
Many people are welcoming folks from the UK who might have contracted the #CoronaVirus and they do not know that they might be aiding the spread. How do we get the word out. The government is just talking on TV. How many folks have TVs, or have power. We need to contain spread
Alot of news going round about #COVID19 please friends and families should be alert as predictions are made on scarcity and recession worldwide. If you have money please get enough food,Gas,medications and stay safe at your various homes. Prepare ahead for the crisis.❤✌
I support my nation for this cause !!! I pledge i will follow janta curfew and will not go out !! Lets pledge together fight this together ! BE SAFE,STAY AT HOME,DONT PANIC. Salute to the people who are fighting with this pandemic 	#CoronavirusOutbreakindia 	#CoronavirusPandemic
Prime Minister Narendra Modi: I request the countrymen to avoid visiting hospitals for routine check ups. If you have appointment for any non-essential surgery, please postpone  for one month. We should keep in mind that pressure should not come on hospitals. #Coronavirus
She was already quarantined for months due to cancer, COPD, and aspergillosis. PLEASE for the the love of god listen to safety recommendations. I wasn’t even able to say goodbye to her bc the hospital didn’t allow visitors bc of #COVID19 &amp; I’m NEVER going to get over that
If I see anyone who even has a tan around me, I’m punching them right in the throat. 		#springbreak2020 #SpringBreakers #springbreak #COVID19 #coronavirus #corona
#COVID19 love. Love. LOVE. when my mom- who 1) is an older person 2) was hospitalized with pneumonia 14 MONTHS ago- has gone to a massively crowded sam’s club like TWICE this week. IT IS WEDNESDAY!!!!!
#QuarantineLife #COVID19 #KansasCity I don’t believe it’s wise to eat take out or purchase any produce or baked goods at the grocery store.  Think about it.  your safest bed for food at this time was made and packaged weeks or months ago.  Time to go canned, boxed or frozen y’all
Trains and metro running 50% capacity but the commuter rate is 100%	Rush= 2x	Double the risk	Such a stupid decision 👏	#coronavirus #coronavirusindia #Mumbai #mumbaicorona
The facts are clear. Italy were too late to react. The rest of Europe is in a practical lockdown. We have to be next! Cant afford to close schools yet everything remain open. This just encourages the spread. Lockdown... save lives. #COVID19 #covid19UK #coronavirus #BorisJohnson
I understand we are all afraid to be alone.. but selfishness may cause other people their lives, their family.. not to mention putting your OWN FAMILY AT RISK!	So BE RESPONSIBLE!		#KitaJagaKita #StayAtHome #westayatworkyoustayathome	#stopbeingselfish #stopcovid19 #COVID19
Me: At in-laws with a 7 week old.	My dad: 65+ with comorbids and living alone.	Brother 1: In Germany, alone.	Brother 2: In UAE, alone.		I don't sleep at nights. I get panic attacks and start crying at 4 am. I'm heart broken and completely helpless.	May Allah help us. 😔	#Covid_19
People are learning quickly. Even in Berlin. So the reality out there is not what the cynical version of #Corona Twitter wants us to believe. Sad fact is that all these adjustments are introduced weeks to late. #COVID19 has not been taken seriously at Bundeskanzleramt. (2)
"it's just the flu" ok but I don't want the fucking flu either! #coronavirus
Ya’ll want ya’ll jobs back? Stay inside for two weeks! Or go outside and spread the virus and have 3 months of unemployment. Your choice! #coronavirus #reality #stupidity #oops
It actually infuriates me that people can be so ignorant that they still want to to go clubbing, restaurants, big public places when the government have advised not to for our best interests to STOP the virus spreading. #COVID19
listen people are dying that have never died before. be safe 💯 #coronavirus
#coronavirus note to those traveling wearing rubber gloves:  they do not protect you when you touch things with them then touch your bags, face, etc with the gloves.  They simply took place of your skin🙄
99% of them are innocent and they're unaware of this situation. So apart from screening, myself and most of my friends are educating them about the risk they're facing now. Just a little step in fighting against #COVID19 	I will continue this until my health allows me 🙏
If people want to enjoy this summer we should all do our part now.  Stay home, keep your distance, and clean! For fuck sake it’s not that difficult y’all. 🙄  #coronavirus #SocialDistanacing
A gang of kids are out in my neighborhood except mine.  Is no one taking this seriously?  #SocialDistancing #coronavirus
#Modi #coronavirus #janatacurfew tr shd not be too much load on hospitals, so pl don't go fr routine check up, call ur family doctor, skip elective surgery,
Following all precautions and regulations, I want you to know that you can count on me for spiritual sustenance like facilitating communion, confession, virtual spiritual guidance or advice, etc. Feel. Free to call or message me. #PriestInMission #happypriest #coronavirus
To everybody who thinks the #coronavirus isn’t a big deal, consider this: your chance of dying from it if you catch it is about the same as rolling a pair of dice and getting snake eyes.  Do you really want to play those odds?
Did ya really just ask me why I cant stop taking immunosuppressants if I'm "so worried" ?? Didn't know that I should suffer my chronic illnes so I can "stop worrying" and "come chill" #coronavirus is a huge risk to me (and my mom) even if I "look healthy" and happen to be 24
Don't be fooled this is not a fight we can win. However we can slow the damage so we don't get knocked out in the first round. #COVID19 #FlattenTheCurve
Paid leave for everyone including all househelps	More pay for doctors, nurses, medical, paramedical staffs	Avoid planned med checkup	Avoid non-essential online services	Be kind to each other		#JantaCurfew #COVID2019india #Covid19India #covidindia #COVID19 #coronavirus #corona
Kudos to the hospitals that are restricting visitors, no one WANTS to do it, but it the RIGHT decision to keep our patients and staff safe. #coronavirus #COVID19
I guess a distribution can be described as a curve, but when I hear bend the curve I think of reducing the rate of new cases and hopefully the cumulative cases over time. #flattenthedistribution #COVID19
#Covid19 	When one of your child's teeth falls, reassure him that there will be another tooth for him in a while.But when you fall, can anyone assure him? Stay home so that your family doesn't smile
‘We’ll do whatever it takes’ is straight out #Cummings book as with ‘Get Brexit done’ ‘Taking back control’. They need to stop this BS and get on with doing it #CoronaVirusChallenge #lockdownuk #COVID19 #covid19UK #FightCOVID19
Since a lot of people still aren’t taking the proper precautions against #COVID19, bio analysts predict a best case scenario of 30,000 people infected by April 13th. That’s almost half the total infected in China. Next best case scenario? Over 120,000. #CoronaVirusUpdate
Time we put the entire country in lockdown. Bring in a curfew! Too many cunts still skipping down the road; pretending nothing is the matter. If you do this you are an imbecile. STAY INSIDE!!! #lockdownuk #covid19UK #UKlockdown #londonlockdown #COVID19 #coronavirus #coronavirus
1. We are in the midst of the largest acute public health crisis in my 54 years AND simultaneously the largest financial crisis and this is just the start. Things are and will continue to worsen due to #coronavirus #marketcrash
Well this Momma is officially working remotely with a 5 year old at home....will be interesting times but I'll take it and we'll manage if it helps reduce the spread! #FlattenTheCurve #COVIDalberta #COVID19
Sweden now only country that hasn’t closed its schools?!? What is going on here? #coronasweden #corona #sweden #Coronavirus
I’m part of the high risk group. But I still have to go to work. Choosing bills over health. #coronavirus #DearAmerica
Just found out I might be a silent carrier for #coronavirus. My roommates coworkers is in quarantine after coming in contact with someone who tested positive. I cant get tested because I'm asymptomatic. I feel absolutely helpless #COVID2019
Kante why is it so hard for people to understand what "stay at home" means or visit a health facility if you have symptoms? 	#coronavirus #COVID2019 #covid19bw #covid19Botswana #covid19_bw
The best way to control the spread of #COVID19 is: 1. Pray vigoursly to seek forgiveness and protection from God. 2. Adopt cleanliness measures to the extent as if u have the virus to protect others from it and as if everyone else have a virus  to protect yourselves from it.
Still seeing lots of calls for the HSE to release info on specific locations cases of #COVID19 are bring detected in		Why?		Your job is to act as though you have it and exercise extreme caution. This is the same whether everyone in your town has it or nobody has it
A school age child in Mobile AL tested positive.  Hope its not a False positive test.  A lot if parents and a bunch of children may have been exposed. 🙏	#coronavirus
Every day further into this #COVID19 fiasco and I still have to go into work I am getting more and more anxious.
Well, today I turned another year older. All year I was excited to celebrate my birthday during spring break. Not like this universe, not like this. Thankfully, I have people the social distance with. #covid19birthday #coronavirus #SocialDistancing
#Coronavirus cancel your wedding. Cancel your bday. Cancel any event. Cancel it now you can always celebrate later
1)Private/public medical universities hospitals can be declared as quarantine ,  2)Governor houses,State guests houses &amp; 5 star hotels can be taken over for keeping critical patients, Khan must act NOW along with all CMs to safeguard nation from #CoronaVirus
1/2 Already being such an anxious person, I’m finding going out food shopping so stressful &amp; uncomfortable. I went to 5 different shops today to try and get food - the shelves were all empty. Grown men were chasing workers down the isles to get toilet roll 🤦🏽‍♀️.. #COVID19
I'm frustrated by the prevalence of people spewing what they "believe" about #COVID19 publicly. This isn't a religious ideology. Science trumps your beliefs. Over 470 people died in Italy today, this is more dangerous than the flu.
#coronavirus #JustinTrudeau #DougFord #isolate Like a wildfire that spreads rapidly, we as one people of this world must ALL self contain this from our least affected following the same as worst. Otherwise we  are burning embers risking everything in path~
This #coronavirus is getting out of hand quickly why not just send out test kits and whoever has it start self quarantine right away. 🤷🏾‍♂️ there are a shitload of people walking who don’t even know if they have it.
The High five 🙌 of #coronavirus          1) #Hands Wash 🧼 them often.                 2) #Elbow Cough 😷 into it.                         3) #Face Don’t touch it.                          4) #space Keep safe distance.              5) #FeelSick Stay Home 🏠
How many of you absolutely can’t stay home? And why? 		#covid19 #pandemic #StaySafeStayHome #StayHome #StayHomeSaveLives
Things would be a lot more serious in the next two weeks. #COVID19 #CoronaVirusNigeria
Whatever Modi said today we should follow strictly.	To keep ourselves and others safe!!#JantaCurfew #CoronaVirusUpdate #coronavirus
Why we don’t learn from Other countries about how treat  #coronavirus. China, tested the people and just redirect the people to a different building, to those who were +. Uk is using the same  🏥 4 everybody. So everybody is touching he same lift, the same doors and all around.
#COVID19 rule#3: Being young+healthy does not mean you’re exempt from social isolation. The disease spreading will overwhelm the health care system and cost lives of elderly and the young. We may have to wait years for the economy to recover but it will.
For those who are allowed to work from home, but still going outside to just hanging out with friends, please can we just exchange?	May God bless us who risk our life against covid19 even though just to come to the office every single day. 	 #WFH #WorkFromHome #StaySafe #COVID19
People going about their business thinking it's just the Flu suddenly all think that public health orgs, hospitals, educated medical personnel, and researchers are all wrong about the severity of #coronavirus, that they're above all of these.		#covid19	#americanego	#WuhanVirus
+as responsable as they can to never even catch a cold least of all the #Covid_19 bc of my condition (lung surgery and asthmatic) but bc of my neighbor I have to take even MORE precautions and I have to wait for my family to come home so they can take out the trash 🤦🏻‍♀️
