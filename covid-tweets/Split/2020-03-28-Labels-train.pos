Weird progression: People that were calling COVID-19 a hoax or some sort of cooked up conspiracy are now sharing petitions for mandatory lockdown. #coronavirus #CoronaLockdown
It‚Äôs sad to see, read &amp; hear that ppl only take the #coronavirus serious if it hits close to home. If they don‚Äôt personally know someone with the illness or if they feel well, they don‚Äôt care. Or, some are in straight denial leading to some reckless decisions &amp; costing lives. Smh

#coronavirus  pandemic proved that humanity in big shit (gran mierda).	People spreading the virus deliberately, others refusing the isolation or quarantine, other hoarding on supplies and scumbags are stealing. 	What is this?	#CoronaLockdown 	#COVID19 	#CoronavirusOutbreak
Provision of free hand sanitizers, distribution of free nose masks to the market men and women won't be a bad start. Intervention centers properly equipped should be made available and their locations made known to the public.	#COVID19 	#StayAtHomeAndStaySafe 	#AbiaState
Please a total lock down Mr. President for two weeks and quick! We can tell..I am from the Netherlands Mr. Trump. Help your people like a true leader should do. #coronavirus #VS
Here‚Äôs an obvious tip, when showing footage on news services of pre this virus outbreak. Maybe a banner or something. Because when you see people shaking hands, kissing &amp; hugging maybe just maybe you‚Äôre sending confusing messages to people watching the news #coronavirus #skynews
If you‚Äôre self-isolating due to Coronavirus, or consider yourself vulnerable, and are in need of anything. We have volunteers who can help.#ahmdiyouth #covid19
