No disrespect but is there a connection between #Kobe and the #coronavirus As in he didn't really die...like the Elvis conspiracy? Think back to what was going on January 26th. Weird but anything's possible I suppose or maybe I've got #cabinfever
Americans are still crying over #COVID19 while the Chinese are free and clear of the #CoronavirusPandemic  #wakeupamericans y’all are stupid
I'm a very reasonable and realistic person. I've looked at all the data and based on the reaction to this #COVID19 	Pandemic. 		The reaction is not adding up.	Not even close.
Government forcing private businesses to shut down and/or forcing individuals to stay in their homes is tyranny whether there’s a pandemic or not. #COVID19 #COVID19ohio
