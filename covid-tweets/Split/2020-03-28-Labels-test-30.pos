Going to a store to buy paint or flowers isn't essential. 	Please stop doing that. 	Stop bringing your whole family, we're trying to limit crowds. 	Stand six feet away and stop getting angry when we ask. 	It's that simple. 	Stay home. 	#Coronavirus 	#COVID19
To all the people who are still going for morning walks outside your home:	You don't see the irony when you say you are trying to stay healthy! 	#COVID2019india #Covid_19india #corona #COVID19 #StayHomeStaySafe #COVIDIDIOTS
I've been social-distancing long before this CoronaVid-1999 thing was a thing...pfffft, amateurs.	#coronavirus #StayAtHome #CoronaVirusUpdate	#IntrovertLife #sahm
