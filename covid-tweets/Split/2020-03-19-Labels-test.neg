#COVID19 alot has to be said for the way the media portrays the news in such events. Releases &amp; headlines should be vetted to curb the propaganda.  The resulting situation of the economy caused in part by #coronavirus is going to be far worse than the problem we are trying to fix
Fear of economic slow down due to corona virus supersedes all other major events like subprime crisis, note bandi, Greece and Brexit etc		Is there a real problem which market is trying to discount or its panic? Only time will tell.		#Markets #marketselloff #Covid19
