I couldn‚Äôt brain how some people can lied about being contacted with a positive #COVID19 just to live like a normal people and spreading the virus to the others. How could you be so heartless and selfish? At this tough time, it reveals how truly Malaysians are, disappointing!
Per the state mandate: Schuham will be closed until it is safe to resume business. Be safe and be well. #COVID19 #business
A big shout out to the amazing staff on critical care at NGH who are preparing for COVID_19.  For those who are coming back to help thank you. We will be tested but I know that together we are stronger.And remember that not all super heros wear capes.#coronavirus #lisaswan
Even when it feels close, the pandemic won‚Äôt really hit us until we lose somebody we love. At that point, all our opinions about it will take a different perspective. Some have died alone #COVID19
Please help each other and prioritize the well-being of your healthcare workers. They are our capeless heroes. 		For those who tried to warn us, thank you. We send our prayers to you as we pray for our country too.		#Covid_19
Regardless of if commencement is canceled, I won‚Äôt be walking. I had every intention to, but #COVID19 put into perspective not only the cost to one‚Äôs health but also the cost to walk across a stage for a piece of paper &amp; a photo. That one moment doesn‚Äôt negate the work I put in.
I was told not to come to work for 7 days because I‚Äôve been in close contact with a coworker who has tested positive for #COVID19 . 		Tishman Speyer is the worst company I‚Äôve ever worked for. As of this time, #RockefellerCenter buildings are open, and I do not know why.
I stay at work for you, please stay at home for us #mta #coronavirus #SocialDistancing
Stop testing asymptomatic NBA players. You want to test so bad, donate that money and tests to the people who really need it! We have symptomatic patients that can't get tested unless they're critically ill and for my population that's too late.	#NBA #CoronavirusOutbreak

I really never thought I‚Äôd see the day where my job, my health, my life, my families lives, my friends lives, were all threatened by something like this. I‚Äôm calling this WWIII. But this time we‚Äôre all at war with the same enemy. #CoronaCrisis #COVID19 #SocialDistancing #wwiii

Guys, he already apologised for his mistake and I guess it's better for me to take down this tweet. Anyway, let this be a lesson for all to not take any opportunity for what is happening right now. I hope everyone is aware with the current situation. Stay safe! #COVID19
Staying home alone will do wonders rather than being panic for the recent outbreak of #coronavirus. So #Stayhome is only action which can can calm down current situation.#COVID2019india #coronavirusindia
