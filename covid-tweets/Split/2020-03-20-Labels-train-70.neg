#coronavirus conspiracy theory:	- people of 70 years and older are the most exposed to be dead from #Corona 	- their children are 40-50 years old and these people vote	- if parents die, children are pissed off and no votes	- hence - fight #coronavirus!
Take the #coronavirus seriously, but don‚Äôt lose your mind over it. 		While some people are vulnerable to it, yes, 90% of people that catch it will make a recovery without a problem.
I'm I only one who isn't panicking an thinks this is all a bit much? Also check out the new powers the state has given itself of the back of the #CoronaCrisis #Covid_19 #coronavirus
So..... is there more to this than ‚Äòthey‚Äôre‚Äô letting on? #coronavirus #CoronaCrisis
Trust me,	#WhatsApp virus is dangerous than #CoronaVirus in India. ‚úçüèª‚úçüèª STAY SAFE
My father is 67 years old and is still going to work every day! #realmvp #Covid_19
Honestly believe that my sunburn from this week is going to be the death of me and not corona #coronavirus
Covid-19 i gonna leave more people bankrupt and dead from suicide (when people lose their job, savings, home) than actual deaths from the virus...		#COVID19 #Corona
