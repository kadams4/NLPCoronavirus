I’m not a medical professional, but I have watched a lot of Greys Anatomy! 	I bet Bailey could find a cure for #COVID19 in a 47minute episode!
Most of the planet just learned how to wash our hands. I know we’re worried about toilet paper, but anyone worried about the global water supply? #COVIDー19 #coronapocolypse #coronavirus #panicshopping #toiletpapercrisis #ToiletPaperApocalypse
I feel like the #Coronavirus is a [test] to envoke fear into the minds of the masses to get people to take the #MarkoftheBeast.. or at least a way to move into the next phase of the #NewWorldOrder...
Black men can’t get the Coronavirus because his girl gone swear he got it from another bitch 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️😂😂	#COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdates #StayHome #Coronaviruscameroon
Hmm...to take advantage of cheap flights and take a trip...  Or sit at home and enjoy my abundance of toilet paper.  #choices #COVID19  #coronapocolypse
The liberal media should be ashamed for politicizing the #coronavirus to hurt their ideological opponents through lies when they should be informing people.  They truly are the enemy of the people and their shameful reporting is proof. #TrumpDerangementSyndrome #JournalismIsDead
Wash hands🖐 catch coughs 🤧 self isolate 🤒. 	This should help reduce  ~1000 global flu deaths per day (oh and ~50 global #coronavirus deaths too) 🤔
What’s really the truth about Covid19??? #COVIDー19 #coronavirus #COVID19 #COVIDCanada #COVID19Ontario
