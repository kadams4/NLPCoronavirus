Really hoping this ends! Horrible times. #ThisTooShallPass #CoronavirusPandemic
So even if the flu is worse than #Covid_19 it‚Äôs still killing people today!? What kind of argument is this?
It is the time to do more now so we can do less better later. #Covid_19 #covid19SA
If you say the coronavirus is dumb or over talked about then you need to educate yourself! It is still a deadly virus!ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Man people these days are... idk if it‚Äôs the things happening in 2020 is worse or the people! #Covid_19 #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic
Is it just me.... or does it feel like Earth is living paycheck to paycheck right now??? #CoronavirusPandemic
300K people have been tested in China	200K people have been tested in South Korea	9K people in the US. Gross negligence by this administration and we have been failed yet again. #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID #pandemic #CancelEverything
If your home is on fire, do you complain about how it started or do everything in your power to put it out? #Covid19 #CoronaVirus
I am trying to not let this whole #CoronavirusPandemic get me riled up. But I will say this, it is ok to be concerned for the people in your community who are 65+ reach out to them, help them, be a good person &amp; wash your hands people!!!!! Ok thanks for listening to my Lilli Talk
I understand schools/companies need to shut down due to the #CoronavirusOutbreak but i cannot afford to live if I am not able to work

Deciding not to care for the elders? It seems unreal, a b horror movie. It breaks my heart. Can‚Äôt even wrap my head around it. #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #ItalyCoronavirus
Anyone that decides to travel at this time...is just fucking selfish.....YOUR ONE OF THE MAIN FUCKING REASONS CONVID-19 IS SPREADING!!!!!		#CANADA	#COVID19 	#TravelBan 	#travel
Is money really more important than peoples lives? Surely the sooner everything is shut down the sooner #COVID19 is stopped. I‚Äôve heard so many pompous medical professionals say we‚Äôre so much better prepared than in Italy. Really? #pillocks
y‚Äôall please wash your hands and be carefulü•∫ #coronavirus #Covid_19 #pandemic

All activities at Warwick‚Äôs senior centers will be postponed for at least two weeks in accordance with the guidelines issued today to protect adults over age 60, who are especially at risk for #Covid_19.
Schools should be closed. Period. There was no snow, so I know y‚Äôall got those snow days in your pockets. Unless y‚Äôall want bodies dropping like flakes. #CoronavirusPandemic #CancelEverything #CloseTheSchools
Be kind to one another, especially in the workplace. Every combination of constraints &amp; concerns will be encountered. Some people will need to WFH, and need support with that. Others' work necessitates being on-site, and they need support with that. Extend your empathy. #COVID19
Hey, *45, the noise is coming from inside the house. üëèMAKEüëèTESTSüëèAVAILABLEüëè Test anyone and everyone who needs it. Release real numbers. Share real information. Lives are at risk. Listen to science. Stop the nonsense. #COVID19 #TESTVIRUSNOW

#Trump should be preparing hospital beds instead of banning travel to #EU. 	American healthcare system will not be able to care for the sick	#WorstPresidentInHistory		#CoronavirusPandemic
Today my posts will focus on dealing with health anxiety following the announcement that the COVID-19 is now a pandemic. Through the day we will be discussing helpful strategies. Please join the discussion #COVID19
Virus carriers may not show symptoms of #Covid_19 for as long as 14 days, and in the meantime they‚Äôre potentially spreading germs. The bottom line is that this is such a new virus, there is just a lot we don‚Äôt yet know. I‚Äôd rather err on the side of caution to protect our public.
Many crucial moments have come and gone in the decision timelines of world leaders. As the mounting data suggests, most countries have responded with too little, too late. Perhaps it‚Äôs time for a data scientist as president. #CoronavirusPandemic #Wisdom #dreaming #COVID19
This is getting crazy... #caronavirusoutbreak please stay safe all! Look out for yourself and those around you! #staysafe #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVirusUpdate #coronavirus #BREAKING #crazy #
The USA is still taking a reactive approach the #COVID19 instead of a proactive approach.  Communities need to be tested immediately.  Containment should be implemented across the board, meaning the public needs to immediately take measures to stop community spread of the virus.
A Hollywood celebrity and a NBA player tested positive üò≥üò≥ #CoronavirusOutbreak
This pandemic is much bigger than politics, disagreements, business, sports, etc... Blessings &amp; love during these times #COVID19
Guys lot of countries are under lockdown. Its time we fill up our refrigerator with food, stock enough groceries and disinfectants for home. Shortly we are going to get 2 week work from home notice #coronavirusindia #pandemic #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus
(2/3) Maximum cases are people with a travel history to infected countries and ofcourse Italians. 65 infected and 0 deaths for a billion people is simply amazing statistics.		Can someone figure out why the #CoronavirusOutbreak hasn't hit India as hard as other nations?
When I tried to alarm people around me because I saw how bad it was in China two months ago. They say: don‚Äôt worry that‚Äôs China. Now: WORSE than China in every aspect. Still ü§¨ how everywhere else has extra months to prepare and now it‚Äôs pandemic. #COVID19 #COVID2019NL
It's already here. Trump can't waive #COVID19 away with another travel ban. Where are the test kits? #TrumpAddress
#COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #coronavirus I personally think that maybe all the affected countries should stop flights coming in and out of the country until they can contain this deadly virus ü¶†
1/x Tips for coping with #Covid_19 anxiety. 1) take good self-care measures for health 2) wash hands regularly per CDC guidelines 3) limit social media use &amp; checking the news (ex: no more than 30 min a day, or check news once a day) 4) avoid ritualistic behaviors #CBTWorks
All you Spring Breakers, stay safe and don‚Äôt bring anything back to the 806! As far as we know, Lubbock is coronavirus-less. But that could all change in a matter of weeks. #COVID19
the US is handling this #COVID19 so poorly
This past week has literally felt like a nightmare. #CoronavirusPandemic
Aware of the panic and all about the likely lockdown--It would do everyone good if we not only think of our own health, but also of the welfare of our families and communities. We might (unknowingly) spread the #COVID19, so please avoid travelling.
IF IN DOUBT?		GET CHECKED OUT!		#cornoravirusuk #COVID19 		If not for yourself, but for every child, parent grandparent, uncle or aunty who could catch it or pass it on to someone vulnerable
We are in this together #Covid_19 #coronavirus
