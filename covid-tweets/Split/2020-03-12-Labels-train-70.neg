I‚Äôm gonna say it. #COVID19 is a fraud. If it is real, I challenge it to come get me. Game on.
People are worried about #CoronavirusOutbreak when there‚Äôs people being abducted by aliens and getting sacrificed to the Illuminati üõ∏üî•
Im just no one here, but: Would the closing borders movement across the globe, the beginning of a 3rd war?   Maybe triggered by the increasing of the migrant crisis? #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #Coronavid19 #Corona
People are forgetting to fact-check the source of articles and information on social media about the coronavirus. Let's not forget that this same attitude also allowed some individuals to raise into power. #CoronavirusPandemic #think #politics #FakeNews

This Coronavirus thing got me thinking. I‚Äôve been loading up on Kleenex the last couple weeks. As soon as there‚Äôs a major diarrhea outbreak I‚Äôm going to be a zillionaire. #Covid_19 #NBA #CancelEverything #pandemic #CoronavirusUSA

Russia borders on China, but there is no epidemic and there will not be.  why?  because the Russians do not believe in the virus. This is cool, proud of my country. 	#CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVirusUpdate #CoronaVirusSA

Wish I had a dollar for every time a kid who has daddy‚Äôs health insurance and trust fund celebrated #COVID19 canceling classes
So I guess, in/by November, Trump will declare a national emergency and close all the polls, putting off the presidential election *indefinitely*. 		It‚Äôll be his way of profiting off of COVID-19. ü§Ø		#CoronavirusPandemic #Trumpdemic
Too many alarming news cascading in the net. Discriminate, validate, confirm before reacting. #CoronavirusPandemic

So I don't have a problem with #WuFlu, #wuhancoronvirus, #ChinaFlu etc tags for the #COVID19 virus as a descriptor.	I don't recall the #Spanish bitching and moaning for the last 100+ years about the #SpanishFlu, so perhaps neither should #China and people claiming #Sinophobia üôÑ
Long vacations ahead???	I really hope war-mongers die of #COVID and v all wake up to a peaceful tomorrow...	#CoronavirusPandemic
It‚Äôs not even 7am and I‚Äôve made the decision to #WFH with a cough (redic) and ordered travel insurance way way in advance for Miami in May! #COVID19 is making everyone paranoid! Still have to take the dog for a walk regardless though! üòÜ
