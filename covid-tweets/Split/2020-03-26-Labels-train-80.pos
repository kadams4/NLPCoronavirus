It’s Thursday in #Singapore and we had our highest single day of 73 new cases yesterday. Is a #lockdown imminent? Stay safe and fully abide by #SocialDistancing so we can avoid being just like every other place. #covid19 🇸🇬
The virus isn’t spreading, PEOPLE are spreading the virus. #Coronavirus #StayHome
The elderly or terminally infirm or suicidally minded cannot offer themselves in tribute to save the rest of us and the economy. COVID-19 doesn’t work like that. It isn’t the Capitol. Newscasters and politicians need to 🛑 suggesting it’s an option. #StayHome #coronavirus
You can’t reopen the country less than a week after most of it starts to Shut down.... I don’t think that’s how this is going to work.#COVID19
This Navratra, Pls help atleast 9 poor families within ur capacity to win our war against #Coronavirus 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 #Coronavirusindia #21daylockdown #Covid19India #CoronavirusLockdown #21DaysChallenge #breakthechain #JeetegaaIndia #CoronaKoDhona #Coronaindia
It’s not just the #coronavirus deaths we have to worry about. If the hospitals are at capacity and you get in a car accident and need to be put on a ventilator, how do you think that’s gonna work out for you?
All this social media shite it's because of 5g there is going to be a world war all this shite, #coronavirus is real you morons ffs every 50 to 100 year something comes like this to test the human race #StayHomeStaySafe
Spread love not the virus... #COVID19
I wonder if the same people who laughed about the #coronavirus knocking off #boomers are still laughing? Still find that funny? #COVID19 🤔🙄😏
I can't help but think that maybe we'd be better off had we elected Joe Exotic in 2016. Let the tigers loose and I guarantee people would be sheltering in place. #JoeExotic #TigerKing #COVIDー19 #coronavirus
Global pandemic I understand. #StayHome I understand.  What I don’t understand is why the automotive industry (car dealerships) feel the need to be open, full steam ahead, while this #Coronavirus takes over our state? #carsarealuxury #Iwantmyhusbandhome
Scumo's 33 #Hillsong mates spreading #coronavirus from the gathering. Making sure this event went ahead was our so-called leaders priority? Not to mention allowing supermarkets to hike prices. $10 for broccoli?!? #EatTheRich #coronavirusau
They should put a clause in this new stimulus package that you have to believe the Coronavirus is real to receive a check 🤷🏼‍♀️ #coronavirus #COVID19
Quarantine games to play at home: 	Duck Duck Go Wash Your Hands	The Floor Is Viral	Hide and Don't Seek	 #COVID19 #Corona #Coronavirus
This situastion is no jokes gaiss, please #StayHome 	#Covid19
I can’t even hug my mom😞 #coronavirus
Oh #coronavirus, how I miss the days when the worst thing that could happen to me from hooking up on #tinder was being murdered.
Rant of the day..if you’ve traveled out of your country lately, recently traveled to an area that was on shutdown for covid19, have fever-SOB-coughing-..please use common sense #COVID19 #StayHome #Quarantine #essentialemployee #icantstayhome
People aren’t gonna take this quarantine serious until the rona starts hitting close to home and by then I just hope it’s not too late for y’all 😣 #StayHome #COVID19
I decree this the "Boy Who Cried Wolf" era. No one took #COVID19 and #socialdistancing seriously because it was the 69th thing that was THE END OF THE WORLD since 2010. SARS, H1N1, Democrats, Ebola,  ISIS, Republicans, etc. When everything is an emergency, eventually nothing is.
Americans still out here kissing tho!!! and u think we about to beat covid19 #COVID19
How do I politely ask my roommate to not be passive aggressive when I ask for #SocialDistancing? They're still going to work everyday and running outside and I'm quantentine-ing, high risk with asthma. I want to be supportive of their work but I don't want #COVID19
I’m a single person. I live alone. Now, working from home. It’s very isolating. I have been calling, FaceTiming, setting up Zoom mtgs w/family, friends, colleagues. Stay connected. #COVID19 #SocialDistancing
Business to open up by Easter? People would like that, but people would also like to stimulate the economy without catching the virus or dying. We can #FlattenTheCuve but we don't dont want a second curve. #COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown #coronavirus #QuarantineLife
How can this country want a full lockdown but yous lot are still fucking abusing that by doing bbqs in parks and sunbathing on a green with a dozen crack heads? #COVID2019 #21daylockdown #coronavirus #panicbuying
We need massive #COVID19 testing &amp; supportive isolation to stop spread. Massively produce medical supplies at cost. Ban profiteering &amp; engage in int'l cooperation, lift all sanctions so every country can heal its people. And give every person money to live now! #BailOutPeople
As of Friday at 6pm when I clock out I will be out of work for the foreseeable future. #COVID19 #StayAtHome
If you not essential, stay ya ass home. #COVID19
Yelled at the kids today for being extra silly while trying to work (working from home). But then I felt awful and regretted it. This isn’t their fault. They’re kids &amp; they’re getting stir-crazy but this isn’t their fault. I have to remember that. #COVID19 #StayAtHome #stressed
People who think that this shelter in place is lame infringement on their freedom are probably the same people who thought their parents partied every night when they were sent to bed! #Coronavirus #COVIDIDIOTS #fomo
People still gathering on beaches and in parks I'm not going to lie I thought #coronavirus was going to go away like sars etc but this is big and is yet to peak and yet I'm still seeing what only can be described as attempted murderers gathering #SatyHomeStaySafe
I am self-employed so I follow shelter in place directives I have no #income if I contract #COVID19 I have no #HealthInsurance If I die from #coronavirus my granddaughters have no #childcare meanwhile most people in #Tulsa are bitching about limitations they aren’t even following
My husband is a physician working with #COVID19 patients. When he gets home, he goes straight into the mud room, wash his hands, throw his scrubs in the washer. What do you do to keep your family safe as a healthcare worker? Let’s keep each other safe 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 #coronavirus
I’m getting so mad at people who are seeing their partners who they don’t live with. I’m not seeing mine to slow down the spread of this disease and protect many lives as possible. 		Do the same, so we can see our loved ones quicker! #CoronavirusLockdownUK #COVID19
Working while #COVID19 is out here is ghetto. This will be my last shift. Run me my check.
In this time of pandemic and quarantine I would like to remind everyone who thought I was crazy for wanting a drawbridge that I still think it’s a great idea. 		#COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown
I’m amazed &amp; grateful for all the technology that has kept me connected to so many during this quarantine including watching a movie w/10 other people, group FaceTime &amp; even attended a birthday party on zoom #CoronavirusLockdown #QuarantineLife #COVID19
She's five... Believe me people, this won't end with the virus.	#coronavirus #COVID19 #StayHome #staysafe
raise your hand if you know what social/physical distancing means and are actually practicing it 🙋🏼‍♀️ #COVID19 #PhysicalDistancing #FlattenTheCurve
The hospital my mom works at has 23 ventilators, 6 are being used. What happens when doctors have to start choosing who lives and dies? It’s all fun and games until it’s your grandma, spouse or child that needs it. #21daylockdown #lockdownnow #CoronavirusPandemic #COVID19
#CoronavirusPandemic #corona #CoronaCrisisuk hundreds soon to be thousands of people are dying and y'all too ignorant snd selfish to stay inside, when it becomes uncontrollable then you can only blame yourselves when deaths rise into triple or quad digits
We are closed 🔐 #COVID19
#darwinnt is not far from getting it’s first confirmed community transmission of #coronavirus hearing kids on planes from interstate (possibly flights with confirmed cases) have gone straight back to school after arriving &amp; not isolating #COVIDIOTS no response from the school yet
Looking forward to the day when this is all over. We'll go to church, hug, shake hands. Do all of those things that we used to take for granted. But while we're in this season let's make the most of it. Study the Word, spend time in prayer, draw closer to family. #COVID19
#coronavirus-so he sees a easter timeline,&amp; what a beautiful,sexy timeline that would be. What?? That's like 3 weeks away. Is this character insane?? Does he think this is a cartoon,some kind of joke. We are screwed. But hey,the economy right.... #coronavirus
there are #nurses out there using masks, low on supplies....why are the big business that we’ve helped...not helping us #COVID19 #StayHome #flatteningthecurve
Woke up this morning still furious about that reckless move by an inconsiderate &amp; selfish senator.		Putting a lot of healthworkers at risk &amp; disrupting the flow of an already depleted hospital. Exposing them to #COVID19. Nightmare.		#selfishpolitician
We have people complaining about no lockdowns on the entire country/their own states.	But think about this.	This disease is spreading only because YOU decide whether you get out of your house and go out in public or not.	And you’re deciding to go out.	#covid19 #coronavirus #usa
Weird thing to be grateful for but I’m grateful my father in law died the week before #COVID19 really hit the US so his granddaughters could say goodbye &amp; we could have a proper funeral. Thinking of the families who can’t do that right now and I’m so sad for them all #coronavirus
#Covid19 Mankind is Reformatting.... Social Distancing, basic hygiene are some survival techniques. Prevention is better than Cure.
I try not to judge people anymore, but if you're not a healthcare professional, please... don't post a photo wearing a N95 mask. You should've donated it to those who really need it. They told us it doesn't help us. They told us not to buy them. #coronavirus #HealthcareHeroes
I'll make a prediction.. If the churches are full on Easter, the country will be in shambles by the 4th of July. #coronavirus #StayHome #BailOutThePeople
Step sister has #COVID19. If you’re young, you’re not immune. You can kill others if you’re careless. STAY THE FUCK HOME!
STAY at HOME Please.....	#COVID19
The most absurd news to wake up to is the Trump administration claiming Singapore 'followed Trump' s instructions' when in reality we started implementing measures at least a month earlier when Trump was still calling the virus a 'Democratic hoax'... #coronavirus
Can only imagine how angry the families of #coronavirus victims must feel knowing that someone passed that on just by selfishly not following advice ☹️#StayAtHomeSaveLives
My prayer to all malaysian and muslims all over the world, please stay safe, please stay home, please obey the RMO and hopefully this #COVID19 goes away soon before ramadhan. Amiinnn
Please don’t joke on April 1st that you got #COVID19 that shit is not a joke. #CoronavirusUsa
Remember to cough in your elbows. I’ve been seeing so many dirty fuckheads cough into their hands all day today 😤😤	#COVID19 #Coronavirus #Covid19Out #lockusdown
It has reached my circle. A family friend was put on a ventilator this afternoon. Take this seriously. Stay the fuck home. Don’t be selfish. #StayHome #ShelterInPlace #coronavirus #COVID19
Stranger danger is no longer just for kids...adults too! #SocialDistancing #strangerdanger #covid19
Can USA please follow Taiwan’s approach and directions to combating the coronavirus and any viruses out there. #TaiwanNo1 #CCPVirus #COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown
I feel like I need to change my iPhone’s face recognition to recognize me in my face mask. 		#EmergencyMedicine #PPE #FirstResponders #COVID2019 #COVID19 #coronavirus #N95mask #goggles #precautions #Masks #PersonalProtectiveEquipment #WashYourHands #StayHome #StayAtHome
ANY BETS THAT THE USA OPENS BACK UP FOR BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE ALL MIGHTY DOLLAR AND THROWS OUT REGARD FOR OUR HEALTH???  #coronavirus #COVID19 #WeWillSurvive #BeSmart
This is a war! We've got innocent civilians and people on the front line dying! To the right thing and #ShelterInPlace #coronavirus
FINALLY! Work has allowed us to go home and not come in anymore due to #COVID19 .. #stayathome #workfromhime
It's makes me kinda uncomfortable that I have to carry around a letter stating that I am a healthcare (veterinary) employee and am allowed to leave my house.  Crazyness. Please stay at home and make this less risky for those of us who HAVE to go out.  #StayAtHome #coronavirus
The most important thing to realise we followers of Sanatan Dharma believe and worship nature, and Nature at the moment is demanding that we give it space and stay indoors. #StayHome #StayHomeSaveLives #COVID19
