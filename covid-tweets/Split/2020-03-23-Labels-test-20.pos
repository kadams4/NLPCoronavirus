Repost. 		Social distancing does not mean go chill at your friends house. Say no to social gatherings and isolate yourselves. 		Pyaar se samjha rahe hai, samajh jao. Warna police dande se bhi wahi kar sakti hai.üòÖ #COVID19 #Covid_19india

Part 4: Since the U.S. and Canada have agreed to lockdown their borders due to the #Coronavirus, perhaps it's time for us here in the U.S. to consider locking down our nation altogether, and give a 1-week notice to Americans abroad to return home, to prevent any further outbreak.
Stay the fuck home guys. #COVIDIDIOTS #COVID19 #StayAtHomeSaveLives
We all have a responsibility that we met fulfill in the next few months. I urge everyone to follow through with the measures set in place by our government #COVID„Éº19 #StayAtHomeSaveLives #coronavirus
