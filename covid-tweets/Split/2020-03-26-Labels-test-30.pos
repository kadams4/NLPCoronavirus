People aren’t gonna take this quarantine serious until the rona starts hitting close to home and by then I just hope it’s not too late for y’all 😣 #StayHome #COVID19
The most important thing to realise we followers of Sanatan Dharma believe and worship nature, and Nature at the moment is demanding that we give it space and stay indoors. #StayHome #StayHomeSaveLives #COVID19
We have people complaining about no lockdowns on the entire country/their own states.	But think about this.	This disease is spreading only because YOU decide whether you get out of your house and go out in public or not.	And you’re deciding to go out.	#covid19 #coronavirus #usa
I'll make a prediction.. If the churches are full on Easter, the country will be in shambles by the 4th of July. #coronavirus #StayHome #BailOutThePeople
We are closed 🔐 #COVID19
You can’t reopen the country less than a week after most of it starts to Shut down.... I don’t think that’s how this is going to work.#COVID19
I wonder if the same people who laughed about the #coronavirus knocking off #boomers are still laughing? Still find that funny? #COVID19 🤔🙄😏
P/2 anyone of those people could be transmitting the virus to the staff and in reverse, then return home to families an spread it a bit more. #StayAtHome AND SHUT THE SHOP. Seems all you want to do is sell cakes than save lives. #CoronavirusLockdown #COVID19 #coronavirusuk
It has reached my circle. A family friend was put on a ventilator this afternoon. Take this seriously. Stay the fuck home. Don’t be selfish. #StayHome #ShelterInPlace #coronavirus #COVID19
People who think that this shelter in place is lame infringement on their freedom are probably the same people who thought their parents partied every night when they were sent to bed! #Coronavirus #COVIDIDIOTS #fomo
I am self-employed so I follow shelter in place directives I have no #income if I contract #COVID19 I have no #HealthInsurance If I die from #coronavirus my granddaughters have no #childcare meanwhile most people in #Tulsa are bitching about limitations they aren’t even following
The hospital my mom works at has 23 ventilators, 6 are being used. What happens when doctors have to start choosing who lives and dies? It’s all fun and games until it’s your grandma, spouse or child that needs it. #21daylockdown #lockdownnow #CoronavirusPandemic #COVID19
It’s 2020 and if you don’t use an app to purchase meals, ie Starbucks or Chickfila, etc., you’re increasing your risk of contracting ANY illness, not just #COVID19 and increasing your chances of passing an illness. Do the world a favor, cause I really enjoy Starbucks.
I can’t even hug my mom😞 #coronavirus
Can only imagine how angry the families of #coronavirus victims must feel knowing that someone passed that on just by selfishly not following advice ☹️#StayAtHomeSaveLives
Business to open up by Easter? People would like that, but people would also like to stimulate the economy without catching the virus or dying. We can #FlattenTheCuve but we don't dont want a second curve. #COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown #coronavirus #QuarantineLife
In this time of pandemic and quarantine I would like to remind everyone who thought I was crazy for wanting a drawbridge that I still think it’s a great idea. 		#COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown
My prayer to all malaysian and muslims all over the world, please stay safe, please stay home, please obey the RMO and hopefully this #COVID19 goes away soon before ramadhan. Amiinnn
Step sister has #COVID19. If you’re young, you’re not immune. You can kill others if you’re careless. STAY THE FUCK HOME!
