Dear Citizens,	Its #lockdown #Karanataka 	No movement on roads.	#Covid19.
I haven‚Äôt left my house in 5 days, which really isn‚Äôt that long yet, but I think it‚Äôs actually the longest time I‚Äôve ever done that in my adult life. Might as well set a personal record. #COVID19 #StayHome
I‚Äôve had a broken foot since Jan basically forcing me into my own quarantine but w/o having any mobility (nightmare) Quarantine does NOT get better overtime! We need to get strict &amp; #COVIDActNow if not most of y‚Äôall are going to go absolutely fucking insane #COVID19 #LockdownNow
Be safe and stay at home #IndiaFightsCorona  #Coronavirus
People still not heeding advice. Tourists happily wandering around the station. Look, we need to stay healthy to facilitate the movement of key workers. Stay away. #COVIDIDIOTS #COVID19 #SocialDistance #stayhome
Love is the ultimate solution to stop further spread of covid-19. If you love yourself you will stay at home, if you love your family &amp; friends, you love yourself üòâ #COVID19
New daily #coronavirus cases in #Italy:-	Mar 21- 6557 new cases	Mar 22- 5560 new cases	Mar 23- 4789 new cases	Hang in there. There is light at the end of the tunnel.	#lockdown works!	#StandWithItaly	#italystaystrong	#staystrongitaly
#COVID19 #QuarentineLife My heart goes out to the lonely in quarantine situation, those in hospitals and cannot be visited and those who are dying without any close relative near. Christ is with you	To all of us #staysafe #StayHomeAndSaveLives
Italy has the worlds 2nd best health care system where india ranked at 112th.	Just Imagine the consequences if you don't lockdown. 	So its better to stay in your home for the next 10 days.	#StayAtHomeSaveLives	#CoronavirusPandemic #Covid19India
Don't go out stay home stay safe #COVID19
Two local deaths from #COVID19. I'm just gonna keep staying inside. #severeasthma #chronicallyill #immunocompromised
Just stay home as simple as that! You want your loved ones to be affected with corona virus? Fuck no!! Then stay fucking home! #coronavirus #lockdownuk
If you're stuck on how to approach the forthcoming days then just remember the slogan that never was;		"Don't  be a Cunt"		#UKlockdown #Coronavirus #StayAtHomeSaveLives
Well I thought for sure this stupid #coronavirus wouldn‚Äôt hit my rural town. We didn‚Äôt shut down any shops or anything. Now a guy is getting tested now with symptoms. My brother and I are isolating ourselves until results come infor kids and parents sake. I miss my kids.
To the people who think that this #COVID_19 *pandemic* is not a serious problem and are not taking precautions to protect themselves and the people around them from the novel #coronavirus...I'm sorry, but you are all IDIOTS.		#COVIDIOTS
Highly disappointed in Africans in general, why am I still seeing people going to clubs and restaurants to flex on IG? 		It was all shits &amp; giggles when we told ourselves that black people cannot be infected by #COVID19 but NEWSFLASH, we are not immune.
Gonna watch all of Quentin Quarantino‚Äôs movies this week. #seewhatijustdid #COVID19 #StayHome #QuaratineLife #idontusuallyhashtagbutshitiwantthecredit
The rhetoric of it being a good thing that it takes more confirmed cases in the US before we even match the number of deaths of other countries is appalling. 		That does not make it okay to ease on our response to this outbreak. 		#SocialDistancing #covid19 #Coronavirus #StayHome
Chatted with some religious people and they strongly believe that religion can protect them from Covid19. Yes/maybe but extra caution won‚Äôt hurt. It‚Äôs time we use social influencers such as religious, indigenous leaders, etc to convey the safety message #SocialDistancing #COVID19
Do something!!!	Quarantine everyone for 2 weeks until this shit is gone #Coronavirus
California friends! In light of park/beach closures due to crowds, here‚Äôs a list of ways we can all help:		1. STAY THE FUCK HOME.		#CoronavirusPandemic #Quarantine
Fijians have extended Families. If one gets #COVID19 there are high chances of 5 or more household members getting infected. Our Country may not have the means to cater for this PANDEMIC!!! Think before you leave your homes &amp; think of the LIVES at stake.
Trump is definitely not interested in workers, the unemployed, the poor... any of us. #COVID19 #TrumpSlushFund is a joke. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #StayAtHomeSaveLives #QuarantineAndChill
Self-quarantine feeds my anxiety, but what absolutely makes my anxiety sky rocket is the thought that this president could just undo it all in a week for the sake of the economy, ignoring the fact that the economy will crash if we undo it all. #COVID19 #StayHome
If you're getting in your car for things other than food, work, medical or anything essential, please get back in your house. Just think The Nightstalker Serial Killer/The Smoke Monster/The Boogeyman is on the loose and you need to stay safe indoors. #COVID19 #SocialDistancing
I know republicans like to project what they do or are going to do onto the other side but who know they meant the death panels would be one. At this rate we will have them all over this country by the middle of April. #coronavirus #StayAtHome
Gonna go have a drink(s) and a panic attack in the shower. ü•¥üíûüçπüç∏ü•É		And yet, I am very grateful #Inslee took this step. So many I have talked to think #CoronaVirus is still a joke. Well, noone is laughing in #Italy and #Spain you selfish assholes.
So I lost my job/s because of #COVID19. And knowing that theres no job anymore and still finishing the final shift was pretty bad feeling. As long as everyone is safe and this thing calms down, I think I am ok with it. No income but yes I will be ok. #australialockdown
America loves being #1 &amp; now Trump gonna make us #1 in #COVID19 infected &amp; deaths if he forces all shutdowns to end. Just to get the Stockmarket going.		Again Republicans	Profit over peoples lives.		#RepublicansAreKillingUs 	#TrumpLiesAmericansDie 	#TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER

In the US, young Americans are getting sick too. 12% of intensive care patients are 20-44 years. Patients are between 20-54 in hospitalizations. Young people can get it ! 53% of cases in NY are people from ages 18-49. We are all at risk #StayHome #coronavirus #COVID19 #usa
If my life was really like The Truman Show, this season would be so boring. Hopefully sweeps is coming up üôèüèº #lockdown #StayHome #COVID19 #SocialDistancing
This is no joke. I‚Äôm running a low fever. I now know of 6 ppl sick, 2 confirmed virus. 		PLEASE don‚Äôt listen to our President or other politicians in denial. Listen to medical experts. I‚Äôm on lockdown anyway but for sure won‚Äôt leave the house for 2 weeks. 	#COVID19
I need Evangelicals to stop trying to contact isolated Amazon tribes during the pandemic.		My ancestors did not want contact prior to 1492 and I am sure they do not want it now #StayHome #COVID19
End of day for #COVID19 new cases is here: US daily growth was 29.7%, down from 38.7% yesterday. A lot better than I expected. 		Must keep going. We will get to the end of this nightmare together.		#StayHome
Every day, more and more places are closing. It is so important for everyone to take COVID-19 seriously and stay home and keep your distance. Don‚Äôt go out unless you have to. The only way this ends is if we all do this. #coronavirus #StayHome
The President and GOP lawmakers calling on workers to go back to work after next week is an insane policy. Not only will it result in a vastly higher death toll than sustained shelter-in-place, the economy will STILL tank if millions get sick. #COVID19

New York needs 30,000 ventilators. They NEED.	Can you even imagine 30,000 people on ventilators lined up?	How many people are needed to take care of just one?	#StayHome #COVID19
I can't decide what im more outraged about at the moment. The spring break idiots or the parents who named their kid Dick Pound.  #COVIDIOTS #IOC #coronavirus
To anyone not self-isolating.		I blame you if you ruin my summer plans of pints in beer gardens...... 		The quicker we begin self to self isolate the quicker this all ends.		Don't make this stretch on longer than necessary		#COVID19ireland #Coronavirus
Social Distancing : Great time for family bonding - Family games,. Lots of love, lots of laughter, helping each other, being there for each other.		#CoronavirusPandemic #SocialDistancing #familytime
#Trump is shot if he thinks we can go back to normal next week. Talk about reckless. He should go party with the spring breakers in #Florida. #COVID19
Just stay at home. 14days only guys. 	#COVID19 #prayformalaysia #StayHome
Anyone else really looking forward to April first and finding out this whole thing is a massive prank? #covid19 #corona2020 	#coronavirusuk #LockdownNow #StayAtHomeSaveLives #AprilFools
PSA: We should already be taking Vitamin D supplements on the regs considering our side of the world doesn't get much sun but if you don't, now's a pretty good time to start cause #socialdistancing during #Quarantine means even less ‚òÄÔ∏è.  #StayHome but #stayhealthy too! #COVID19
If you found out today you were positive with the virus, would you be proud of your interactions the last few days in public? How many people would you have to notify that you potentially infected them? Keep that in mind for tomorrow. #COVIDActNow  #COVID19
The country will not stay shut down for long. Our economy is a wasteful one organized around constant and irrational consumerism. Anything short of this will not fly with special interests. #covid19 #COVID„Éº19 #LockdownNow #StayAtHomeSaveLives #CoronavirusUSA
Hoping and praying everyone is keeping safe in the name of Jesus. God Bless ‚ò∫Ô∏è	#StayHome #staysafe #coronavirus #Quarantin

It's the perfect time to make a huge clean up of our lives, the real one and the virtual one. I think. #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus #StayHome #march2020
Hey, guys. Remember, like, 3 weeks ago, when things were mostly normal?	.	.	.	Yeah, me neither. #covid19 #StayHome
This one is for the history books along with the plague, 1918 flu etc		The decisions we all make play a huge part in how this unfolds for the future generations		Hopefully they will look back in decades from now at the wise choices we all made #Covid19 #StayAtHomeSaveLives #NHS

I think it might help if people either 65+ or younger but medically compromised to share #AtRisk &amp; say why they need EVERYONE to stay home to help people understand. People may not realize who they are putting at risk around them.		#COVID19 #COVID #StaySafe #StayAtHomeSaveLives

There is no data suggesting the US is bending the curve. Many Americans are still not taking social distancing seriously. This will get worse. 		#Coronavirus
If Taylor Swift can disappear from the public eye for an entire year without anyone seeing her, y‚Äôall can stay home for a couple weeks without going anywhere non essential. Geez. #Michigan #shelterinplace #coronavirus

Tip of the day		#COVID19 		Information is vital, but where you get it from matters.	Evidence based medicine is the way to go. Please read informations about the virus from proper sources and tweets from professionals.		Do your part, #FlattenTheCurve
My sister‚Äôs co-worker said a lady in our city posted online she has #coronavirus. Our friend who works at our CVS confirmed &amp; forwarded the post. The lady came into contact with at least 14 people. WTF. It‚Äôs freakin‚Äô scary. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü¶† #StayAtHome #StayHome #selfisolation

I really wish all counties in Houston would put out a "Stay at home" order. I live in #galvestoncounty but work in #Harriscounty so now I'm all sorts of confused. #coronavirus #COVID19 #Texas
A global pandemic is not the time to exercise your civil rights. It's the time to sit down shut up and stop getting people sick. 	#covid19 	This is why the US is doomed.
#ukcoronavirus #UKGoverment the government is still not serious they should close essential and non essential and provide for people whatever they need there is a way Uk is a stable country please lockdown everything this way we can save life‚Äôs #CoronavirusBillUK #coronavirus
