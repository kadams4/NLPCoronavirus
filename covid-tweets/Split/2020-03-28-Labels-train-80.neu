We keep hearing billions of Naira being donated for the fight of covid-19 but we don‚Äôt get any my question is where is this money going to #tundeednut #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID19

Before anyone sees the News or reads Tweets about the number of #COVID19 cases in America. Italy has a Population of about 61 Million and the US has a Population of about 327 Million. So Yes the MORE people get tested, the MORE cases we‚Äôll have. Don‚Äôt be alarmed, be aware üñ§

I‚Äôm hella losing weight now that I‚Äôm not going to the gym wtf my booty gains #CoronaLockdown #coronavirus #COVID19
The thing dangerous than #COVID19 is the incompetent people at the top post of Government and equally all these deluded irresponsible citizens.
2. US will cross million cases within 1-2 weeks, most likely they will go untested for a while. No health system can contain or test 1 million people in a day or a week.		By the time the 1M being tested, God knows how many more might be infected. #COVID2019 #coronavirus
Hey guys, just a reminder that we could have taken care of this a way long time ago if someone led our country with either competence or a heart. Okay, thanks! #Covid_19
Very sad to hear about the number of dead people today! Condolences for All passed! #coronavirus
Is this the apocalypse and total world collapsed  #Covid_19 ?
Both Boris Johnson &amp; Donald Trump changed their strategy midway through the pandemic &amp; embraced actions experts had recommended for months.Those early failures were a proximate cause of the deaths of many. If this were a company we might be looking at criminal charges.#Covid_19
#Inslee is absolutely destroying the Beautiful state of #Washington. His lack of leadership allowed people to die.. He‚Äôs in way over his head.. Then he has the gall to blame #Trump #COVID19 #washingtonstrong

For 108 years we have criticized the Titanic for not having enough life boat space for all passengers. 	However we, in 2020, live in a country with only 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 citizens.  	Side note: 31 other countries come ahead of us in beds per 1000  citizens. #COVID19

As a favor, please tag your  #COVID19 tweets. Honestly, I love you all, but I come here to NOT think about it and distract myself with beautiful Adam Driver and Ben Solo. I‚Äôm going to mute the tag, I may have to start muting people. I hope you understand.

Love Pharma &amp; biotech companies!! They‚Äôll pull us out of this situation w/#COVID19.

This #coronavirusoutbreak is more stressful for the family. Doing my best to keep sanitized and safe. But, fear of the invisible killer lingers on, taking a mental toll on my mother, wife, son, who are petrified every time I walk out of the main door. #COVID19
Day 14 of #FlattenTheCurve: Kids and other families gave a birthday parade for girl in culdesac. My older kid told my wife she is afraid of my wife, her mom getting #COVID19 and dying; OMG!  Whitefish salad for lunch, pork tacos for dinner; food delight.
Getting drunk so when I‚Äôm hungover tomorrow someone remind me I‚Äôm hungover and not having symptoms of #covid19
My three year counting the #covid19 curve:	"1,2, A lot"	Sums it up really.	(Incidentally how he nominates how many pieces of cake he should get...)
#CoronaVirus has introduced exponential growth to the world. So why not keep it going: if you could fold a piece of paper in half as many times as you wanted how many folds would it take for the thickness to reach the moon? (Hint: what data do you need?) assume the thickness of

So #COVID19 is not completely ruled out for me. Pneumonia is getting no better in current antibiotics. What does this mean for me. 		More meds and back into full blown quarantine again. 		Someone kill me please.
Who also heard the blast ? 		#TBJoshua #COVID19 #Asteroid2020
No offence but anyone quarantining down south with a pool at their house and 75 degree + temps can kiss my cold, pale, white ass! #COVID19 #CanadaCovid19

Folks....it‚Äôs very simple why the media and left won‚Äôt give Trump any credit. They can‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt want to lose an election in November. Their hate of the President is more important than the citizens of the USA. #COVID19
I don‚Äôt understand why so many deaths in Italy - seriously 		Do anybody has a serious answer ? 		#coronavirus #italy #wtf #sosad
Quebec really the type of people to have 400 #Covid19 cases today.		Should have let them leave when we had the chance.
The reason being quarantined doesn‚Äôt really phase me Is because during most of my junior and high school years I was grounded. I‚Äôve trained for this like  it‚Äôs an Olympic event. #chynuhvirus #coronavirus  #iftheartofgettinggroundedwasasportingeventidbemichaeljprdan

It's REALLY bothering me how folks are using #covid19 as an opportunity to completely DESTROY an entire group of people just because they belong to a certain political party. This goes for both sides of the aisle.		STOP IT.	PEOPLE ARE SICK, DYING, &amp; SUFFERING.  	WE CAN DO BETTER.
....someone living on campus with me is presumed positive and decided to not tell anyone. Posted about it on fb, blocked a bunch of school people, and refuses to tell administrators or anyone else. I‚Äôm immunocompromised. I‚Äôm high risk. #COVID19
