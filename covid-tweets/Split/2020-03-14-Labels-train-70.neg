I think I'm going to die faster from a #hangover than #coronavirus
Only around 140,000 cases confirmed globally of people infected by #Covid_19 with over 5000 deaths,which is around 3.5% chance of dying....either the numbers are wrong,or the experts are🤷🏼‍♂️
The media is the true virus, it's infecting people more than anything. Some more than others. #COVID19 #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates
I’m about screwed atm with #Covid_19 as Norway’s on something of a lockdown on flying. Supposed to be going back to the UK next week to grandads to live and work. 	Can’t work it all out.  Flight prices have bombed though, so I’m thinking just do it ? from  #Viking stock us lot !
Did you notice that winter is back? This fluctuating weather could support viral infections. Still wondering if we contributed to this pandemic through our global abuse of nature?? #ClimateCrisis #COVID #coronavirus
If we just commit to a total-isolation spring, we can still have a everybody  get wasted and spit in each other's mouths summer!		#coronavirus
Needless panic in the towns	Nobody caught it but we all fall down	The media moans and whines and cries	We scratch our heads over all the lies	#COVID19
Unpopular opinion: 	Corona virus was created by the government to reduce population.	#coronavirus #COVID_19uk
This #CoronaVirus scare where people are afraid to leave their homes reminds me of the #nineeleven scare. #COVID19 #SaturdayThoughts Grow up people
I wonder why governments tend to exaggerate the consequences of #coronavirus !	People need more protection or treatment advices (awareness). 	.	.	No point in #panic , but more psychological pressure 😷
How fitting that people are acting irrationally on #PiDay 	#coronapocalypse 	#coronavirus 	#CoronaOutbreak 	#DatRona
We need toilet paper and I’m afraid I’m going to go to the store and see that all the idiot doomsday preppers bought it all. Way to shit all over my Saturday #COVID19
Can we get a virus 🦠 that wipes out the stupid. Especially the toilet roll idiots. #CoronaVirusUpdates #COVID_19uk #coronavirus #coronaUK
I'm one of those people that gets a "change in season" cold. It's either in October or in April, but I get it. When April hits people going to start freaking out when people have similar colds and think it is #coronavirus #COVID19
So New York has had its 1st death, its very first one from #COVID19.  The victim was 82 years old and had been "long suffering" with emphysema.  I am middle aged, very healthy, train daily, non-smoker with zero underlying health issues.  Im not in the least bit worried about my..
#Chinese virus will last as long as #Chinese products. Don’t worry so much 😉 #coronascare #covid19 #economicMeltdown #stayalert #staysafe
Can we rename the #CoronaVirus to #MoronAVirus?	Because that seems to be the main symptom now. Everyone has become an idiot.
Any danger of some media led positive vibes on Corona V?? A few uplifting vids of people who have contracted and come out of it fine maybe? Everything so far seems to be detailing death...obvs very sad but human reaction will be driven by what we see and read.  #COVID19
Considering hosting a party at my house.  It’s gonna be BYOTP. #coronavirus
All of this social distancing to avoid #coronavirus is going to lead to people drinking by themselves and being lonely. Fortunately for me I’ve been practicing for this moment for years.
Just can’t work out why everyone is stressing about the ability for the UK to cope with treating #COVID19 when every other person on Twitter appears to be a virologist or MD?? Which, given they all seemed to have a PHD in political science Pre #brexit, is even more comforting
Part of me wants to get Corona Virus so I can say I’ve gone viral #coronapocalypse #CoronavirusUSA #Covid_19 #CoronaOutbreak #coronavirus
If I get #coronavirus  im taking out a 60k loan and putting a golf sim in the basement no questions asked
Imagine a time where the Chinese economy is nearing collapse. As secret as they are, they wouldn’t let the world know. Instead they create a virus, spread it globally and somehow create a vaccine a year ahead of the world...and sell it globally... #coronaUK #covid19 #CoronaVirus
So this is what it's like for people who don't like sport. 		I'm bored already...	#coronavirus
Sometimes I wish this coronavirus was a conspiracy because, then, I feel there will definitely be a cure.. #covid19
Why panic, when you can PRAY	Nothing is greater than GOD		GOD is Bigger, Greater and more Powerful than #Covid_19 		Pray 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 We have GOD
While everyone is stocking up on toilet paper, I’m stocking up on Excedrin 		Cus y’all give me a headache. #coronavirus #Covid_19
I sneezed in front of my laptop and the anti-virus software started a scan! 😎🤓	#coronavirus #Covid_19 #CoronaJokes
I’m so thankful the 250 person gathering ban doesn’t effect Joe Biden’s rallies at all 🙏🏼 #coronavirus #Biden
Please dab to save the boomers #dabtobeatcoronavirus  #Covid_19
I’m so so SO over hearing &amp; talking about this Corona Virus stuff.... tell me something good happening in your life! #coronvirus #COVID19
