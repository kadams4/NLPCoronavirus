Never heard as many sirens in Brooklyn as I have tonight. Feel lucky to be able to #StayAtHome &amp; be safe in my apt. 		Thinking of our 1st responders who are also running low on #PPE &amp; overwhelmed in this #COVID19 crisis. 		Pray for #NYC y’all 🙏🏽
Only in the #Philippines. A Senator who’s positive with #COVID19 didn’t give a rat’s ass about #quarantinePh and went to the hospital’s delivery room with his pregnant wife and sister in law. To hell with other people he endangered, he wanted to go. Shame on you! Burn in hell!
Drop your COVID haikus here. 	This is mine.		Unprecedented.	Distance will unite us all. 	Do your part. Stay home.		#COVID19 #COVID2019 #SocialDistancing #PPE #coronavirus #haikuchallenge
How to boost your immune system;	Rest	Warm liquids	Vitamin D	Avoid Sugar	Vitamin C	Flavonoids	Vitamin A	Vitamin E	Vitamin B6	Stay wherever you are, do not travel, 	 there are chances of being exposed to the virus, protect your family and your loved ones. #21daysLockdown #COVID19
Dr. Devi Shetty on CNBC interview says there will be at least 80000 positive cases in Karnataka alone in next 10-12 days. If we aren’t serious about Social Distancing then we are fucked. #CoronavirusLockdown #CoronavirusPandemic
#coronavirus spreading fastly plz stay at home
My life and the lives of many who are forced to work during this virus are being put in danger by people who are "bored of being home" or "don't care what happens" which means my life is worthless in their eyes. What are other people worth to you? #COVID19
even thought the #coronavirus cancelled all my fun trips, I can’t help but feel even more grateful to be home with mama and pops. my absolute people. ♡ even if they won’t hug me.
Y’all niggas out here fucking and sucking niggas dick RAW! Different niggas everyday! Then wanna try to Quarantine from the #coronavirus fuck out of here! Then y’all wanna get mad when somebody call y’all out! TF away from me I don’t want non of that shit!
TRAVELLERS: you MUST quarantine for 14 days!! there are people who think they’re safe because they don’t have symptoms, and still go to grocery stores. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. having no symptoms for a week doesn’t rule you out and there’s EVIDENCE BEHIND THAT. #COVID19 #COVIDOntario
You'll stop laughing at people who take this Covid-19 in a serious way until it happened to you, or to your loved ones and you didn't get any chance to kiss them bye. #COVID19 #CoronaIndonesia #COVIDIDIOTS
Staying home watching pandemic indicators around the world is an exhausting routine, yet it shows how dangerous the situation is becoming each minute.	.	.	.	.	#COVID2019 	#StayHome 	#coronavirus 	#PrayForTheWorld
We supermarket workers are risking our health so you can come out to buy essentials..... ESSENTIALS!!! 	Not an xbox game, hair band or fucking flower pot 😠 #covid_19 #coronavirusuk
On the front lines of this thing. It’s really about to ramp the fuck up #COVID19
If you know a healthcare worker or first responder, reach out to them to say thank you and see how they are doing.  Stay safe, stay healthy. 2/2	#COVID19	#WeAreInThisTogether
My wife and Sam are now staying at her grandads house for a while to keep away from me. 	Being ill and alone is going to be a horrible combo 😔	Miss them already.	#COVID19 #coronavirus #cysticfibrosis
I deadass get anxiety the night before I have to go into work now.. This shit isnt a joke anymore.. Let's pray for all our safety 🙏🏼 #COVID19  #HealthcareHeroes

New continuous cough this morning so I'm in Isolation for 7 days and the rest of the family for 14 days. #StayHomeSaveLives #COVID19
Flights are still packed! Crazy!!!! They should be seating passengers only on the window seat and on every other aisle! 1A 1F 3A 3F 5A 5F 7A 7F and so on! Believe me!!! How has no airline thought of this yet! #covid19 #coronavirus #airlinesafety #stopcovid19 #passengersafety
I just wanna make this point in case some of y’all haven’t realized it yet ~ the longer you don’t comply with social distancing, the longer we’re gonna have to do it. STAY HOME #SocialDistancing #CoronavirusPandemic
You know what, #COVID19 does not move, we move. We stop &gt; #COVID19 stops? We move, it moves? 	You know the key now? Please #StayHomeAustralia 	#covid19australia
We will all eventually be infected with #COVID19, short of having a vaccine available. The point is to decrease the rate of spread, and avoid exposing those most vulnerable. That’s what #FlattenTheCurve means, and why #PPENow for healthcare workers is an absolute necessity.
My old dear is a recovering breast cancer victim. She is also a Nurse at East Surrey hospital (NHS), working as part of our front line staff tackling #COVID19. All the government are asking you to do is to #StayAtHome. Don’t be an ignorant moron! #StayAtHomeSaveLives
I'm watching the news: they're juxtaposing footage of Mayor Garcetti &amp; Gov. Newsome (asking people to stay indoors) with footage of CROWDS of people playing soccer at a park and another group skating in Venice. I am beyond furious with the selfish people. #COVID19 #StayHome
The Crazy shit about the #COVID19 is that people in Calabar ain’t taking it serious. Imagine someone organizing a crusade in ikot ishi, at these point in time. Who we offend now? #LetsFightCovid19
#45's unemployment numbers are going to go through the roof. That's why he wants y'all back at work and praising God on #EasterSunday. #coronavirus #StayHome #COVID #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #TrumpMeltdown
As a pharmacy tech that has patients, friends, &amp; family on forms of chloroquine/hydroxychloriquine for legitimate reasons, I'm gonna put this bluntly: folks taking/hoarding these medications &amp; the doctors prescribing them for off-label use to treat #COVID19  should be ashamed.
It honestly astounds me that people are still going out and socialising with others outside their household. 		Stop being selfish. Stop putting the NHS under more strain. Stop putting people at risk. 		All together now: STOP👏BEING👏SELFISH👏		#COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown
Everyone, if walking along the road for exercise or to get essentials pls make #SocialDistancing easier by walking in the direction of the traffic where possible and remember what 2m looks like #CoronavirusLockdown #Covid19Out #COVID19 #coronavirus
Update 8.5 days into #coronavirus . Cough easing slightly, feeling optimistic. Started back working from home not finding it too bad.
The best solution to fight the #COVID19 pandemic in Cameroon is a total lockdown. If things get worse, we neither have the infrastructure, nor the money, nor the expertise, and looking at the behavior of some top state officials, we might not even have the goodwill to fight it.

continue through #COVID19 pandemic. PCPs are charting unknown front line waters. Please support our nation’s #primarycare workforce in every way you can - legislatively, clinically, regulatorily, economically, publicly - so that access to primary care survives and...
I don't understand the point of shutting all these different places down for 14 days, when there is still a lot of places open. They need to shut everything down  besides grocery stores, drugstores, gas stations, and the LCBO so the ladies can get their wine! #COVID19
We are passing through a Pandemic #covid19. India Lock down from 25th March to 14th April' 2020. So, Stay at home &amp; be safe. Save yours &amp; save others too. Only medicine of Corona virus is To Stay Home &amp; Stay Safe.

Feeling very fortunate that I’m lucky enough to still have a job during this difficult time. I feel like that we as humans need to be there for one another and grow together in our communities. We can and will come out stronger as communities through this. #Covid_19
It’s hard for the self-employed and daily-paid to self-isolate. What will they eat? The government needs to reach out to the people and help those in dire need. #COVID19

Many states don't have a problem?!! He's fucking insane #StayHome #coronavirus #TrumpLiesAboutCoronavirus
If you are having trouble staying home with all the bells and whistles that a majority of us have, maybe just think about somebody like Anne Frank.  #coronavirus #CanadaCovid19
Help us &amp; the NHS save lives by staying at home. Essential travel only. Follow the government guidelines. We will be stopping people across our area &amp; challenging you to prove your reason for travelling and being out and about #StayAtHomeSaveLives #coronavirus #999onthefrontline
Can someone explain to our leaders that it's not considered shutdown/social distancing/reducing cross infection, if people are freely allowed to ride public transport/cars,leave their children to mingle at daycares &amp; kill time by multiple grocery store shopping trips #COVID19
The #coronavirus does not recognize borders, it's a global problem that we have to fight together, your flippant or irresponsible behavior could be a death sentence for someone #stayathome
I have been sick for 14 days now, symptoms waxing and waning throughout, yesterday I felt like my lungs were filled with glass, it only improves when I take 500mg naproxen and even then I can still feel it. I still can’t get tested.  #coronavirus #COVID19
Another day completed and another day of far to many people who don’t need to be out and about . #stayindoors #999onthefrontline #Convid19uk #coronavirus #999Family #HelpPreventTheSpread #nhs #CoronavirusLockdown #COVID2019
I just realized today that the #covid19 Global Pandemic is the world’s longest and worst game of ‘The floor is lava’.  Please, don’t leave your home unless you really need to.
