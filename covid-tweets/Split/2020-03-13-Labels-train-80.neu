So I heard if you hold your breath for 10 seconds and not cough that’s how you know if you have #coronavirus or not 🤷🏾‍♀️
There is only one sensible thing to do. Call this season null and void and hand the Premier League to the team with the most titles #coronavirus
Markets are crashing because a deal isn’t done until you shake hands. #coronavirus #stockmarketcrash
Anyone else missing Brexit? #Covid_19
Perfect trifecta this week: #covid19 #fullmoon #FridayThe13th and a #fullmoon. I am exhausted and wanting a week long nap.
What is sweet is sweet!	What is bitter is bitter!	Now, it's bitter for Nigerian politicians to travel for medical check up and functions.	#CoronaVirus~~~kolo werk🙆🙆🙆
The stock market crash isn't due to #covid19.  It is due to our goverment's failure to provide guidance and leadership. #maddow
Is anyone else spraying Lysol on their train clothes once home or Amazon boxes? Asking for a friend. 	#coronaflu	#Covid_19	#CoronavirusPandemic

I am thinking non effected games will go ahead this weekend due to fans having travel plans. Then that will be that for the foreseeable. Euros will be moved back 12 months and the season will reconvene and run through when euros should of been on.  #SCFC #Covid_19
This #Covid_19 crisis has my anxiety going crazy. 😬😬
Can Twitter create a #Coronavirus tab and move all related tweets out of normal timelines and into a special section? It pays to be informed, but this is becoming way too much. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Corona Virus is out of hand. I just sneezed and even my dogs got up and left the room. #CoronavirusPandemic
No traveling	No sports	No music	WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH OUR LIVES	#coronavirus #COVID19

Since everyone trapped inside, 3 things will increase. 	#1 Fights: From not use to being home together	#2 Pregnancies: For the same reason and lack of other activities 	#3 Weight: Eating and walking, running, and sweating (except for #2) #CoronavirusPandemic #lockdown #Covid_19

No more baseball... so now what happens?	Some Ootp perhaps, maybe endless baseball documentaries, books, movies and the like, perhaps binge watch #MLBNetwork until my eyes bleed....?	What's a mule to do.	⚾️ 🐎	#Athletics #MLB #CoronavirusPandemic

Applying in Manila? Yes, 100% planned.  Maybe I'm just in a wrong time now  yet there's a reason for why this is happening🌱 Everything was stopped ,cancelled, delayed and  even suspended. Im stuck  around  in the midst of #Covid_19.  I'm about to give up😭 Pls cheer me up!🙈
BREAKING:	Premier League SUSPENDED following suit of the EFL	#PremierLeague #Covid_19
And yet another Premier league player tested positive for COVID-19 😬 Wonder what genius thought it was going to be a good idea to continue playing at the weekend #PremierLeague #COVID19
Russia has been suspiciously quiet over the #CoronavirusPandemic the biggest country in the world, and not a murmur? Or have I missed something?

Her Momma named her #Wuhan	VIRUS. I'm calling #Covid_19 the	#WuhanVirus or our new #BatFlu.
Just got word that the Forsythia Festival is cancelled this weekend because of #coronavirus ...I’m getting worried now. Really needed this festival financially right now. Have full time employees to pay &amp; bills to pay. Ok. Now I’m scared.

English Football League has agreed to suspend all games until at least 4 April due to #CoronavirusOutbreak
Now I wonder how they are handling #Covid_19. Travel to/from China is very common. Are they allowing employees to work from home? Will they see their policies are putting their employees at risk? Will they finally understand working from home is just as productive as onsite work?
So Now What with all of these big Sporting events and Other events and places close down thanks to the #CoronaVirus What else is there to do ??????? #NFL #NBA #NFL #NHL #MLB #XFL #WWE #COVID19
We care more about our footballers and other sportswomen and men (and fans) than children? #schoolclosures #CoronavirusPandemic
You want to know why #Covid_19  makes me anxious? Because asshats are emptying the grocery stores in panic, while I just need to shop and feed my family. Rows of bread, meat, canned goods, Mac and cheese all gone. #panicbuying is not how we face this as a nation.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭		The world is shutting down with the #COVID19 Football players and officials are being affected. Presidents of nations are being isolated. The global economy is crashing. Events are being cancelled. Travellers are being stopped.		Lord! Save us! We need your help!
Is #coronavirus trending only in my TL ?
Generally feel like the world is in a game of Plague Inc right now. 	#CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19
latest news, earth is suspended #Covid_19
It seems like we are living in a movie #coronavirus
#cryptocurrencies are not a safe haven asset nor a disaster hedge they are a trading tool. The #coronavirus has made this quite clear and my thesis saying otherwise has been proven irrefutably wrong. With that being said we are buying equities at our target entry prices.
Only 287 panic-buying days until Christmas! #Covid_19
What a Thursday the 12th huh? Thank god we have Friday... the 13th... #FridayThe13th #COVID19 #NHL #abhealth #RTBNNews

Just a reminder that the average American is always the one left holding the bag		#coronavirus #maga
