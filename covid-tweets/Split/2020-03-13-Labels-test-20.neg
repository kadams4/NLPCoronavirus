Ill be damned if I let #coronavirus ruin my birthday plans. THE SHOW MUST GO ON
#UnpopularOpinion Closing everything and cancelling school and events due to Coronavirus is rediculous.. If people would just have common sense and stay home if they are sick we wouldnâ€™t have to worry about it spreading. ðŸ˜¡#CoronavirusPandemic
This seems like an awful lot to give up for lent. #Covid_19 #corona
Iâ€™m kind of over people conflating responsible precautions and panic.  #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus #COVID19
The country will come to a stop until ppl realize the #FakeNews  with #Democrats behind scaring everyone. Thy put ppl in a panic so they can wreck the  #Trump  Economy. Itâ€™s all about hitting Trump for the Presidency.  #CoronaOutbreak is real but #politics caused Panic #Covid_19
I feel like the media blows every little virus out of proportion &amp; when there is an actual pandemic we didnâ€™t take them serious. Now theyâ€™re canceling all this shit &amp; were like ðŸ˜³ okay itâ€™s something to be worried about this time. #CoronavirusPandemic
This #CoronavirusPandemic is a joke / the human race has been really disappointing these last few decades #Bribe #Corruption #Politics #Money is all that matter to these #politicians 		#Lobbyist #Democrat #Republicans #Trump #Clinton #Bush #Obama #AmericaFirst #America #USA
I feel like at the end of all of this we will find out that this whole #coronavirus problem somehow was Antonio Brownâ€™s fault #stillsour
