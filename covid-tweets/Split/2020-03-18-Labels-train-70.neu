I hear complaints that young ppl aren’t taking #coronavirus seriously, but my boomer neighbors heading out for a St. Paddy’s celebration in full Irish regalia yesterday, beg to differ.
The coronavirus is the Chinese super one terrorist which is easily travelling from one country to another country without getting any protection and  operations are going on... Still now no one country can invent the medicine to arrest #coronavirus
Government plan to provide £330bn to help business owners and homeowners during the #covid19 crisis.  What about those of us who are employees, or/and who rent?  What help is there for us?  I guess this is what people voted for.

Brexit was about closing our borders to Europe. Yet as soon as we have an actual problem that has catastrophic potential and needs containment, we keep the borders wide open! Mental. #coronavirus #brexit #proudremainer

If there's no cure for #coronavirus how are some people surviving it	And others are dying
One of the interesting things about #coronavirus and the healthcare system is that it shows you that even in a Capitalistic society we still have limited resources. Your accessibility to healthcare is still prioritized. You can still pay an arm and leg and be turned away.

Anyone else find it odd that the youth climate activists that lecture about listening to scientists are the same ones ignoring scientists and saying fuck it, I don't need to quarantine and ruin my spring break. #sorrynotsorry #coronavirus
Makes me mad how #EU was in the last 6 months totally absorbed by  climate (as important as it is ) not leaving any bandwith to prepare with the impending #coronavirus crisis which could destroy Europe as we know it. We have reason to be worried what this means for democracy.
