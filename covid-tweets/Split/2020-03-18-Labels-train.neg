REMINDER: You‚Äôre more likely to be killed by a Clinton than the #CoronaVirus
a note of caution for the ones that see the huge numbers of new cases in NY City: it is not because social distancing failed. It‚Äôs because we started testing on Monday! Expect to see further increase. Imagine if we were testing everybody as in S Korea! #coronavirus #NYCLockdown
Another day of the shop being a quarter full, another day of people asking why, its going to be like groundhog day for a few weeks #coronavirus I'm going to try and start a different conversation today as I'm giving up the will to live
Not normally a conspiratard, but can't help thinking the #coronavirus panic is a priming exercise for the shutdown of economic growth deemed necessary in order to "combat climate change". Either that or an extraordinary dovetailing of aims.
This #COVID19 aint messing up my 21st
Glad that #Belgium gave us a soft #lockdown with #SocialDistancing cause we get to still go out and #workout on our ownor with 2 #Coronavirus 	Hope it doesn't get worst!
I can be critical of the government at the same time comply with protocols. 		COMPLIANCE is different from BLIND AND SILENT OBEDIENCE. 		I ALSO do my part to help with GROUND OPERATIONS.		So yes, I have every right to call BS when I see BS. 		#Covid19
Damn the rona got the bars closed down :/ ........... but we still got the trap house ehhhhh #COVID19 #coronavirus
What is the safest country to travel in these days? 	#COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak
The only thing new in my normal is a temperature check before entering work. #whatssocialdistancing #massagetherapist #mynewnormal #coronavirus
Willing to vote for whichever candidate will re-open the gym, now. #coronavirus #ChinaVirus #KungFlu
The odd truth about the #coronavirus is that it appears to have about a 1 in 50 chance of killing you.  Most black men have a higher probability of being murdered or sent to prison, especially after the #Biden/Clinton 1994 crime bill
I firmly now believe that #coronavirus is not what it seems and in fact the current behaviour by the elected elite is actually much more sinister.		Are they crashing economies globally on purpose so as to eventually ignite global growth.		Things are not adding up.
Everyone is worried about the #CoronavirusOutbreak I‚Äôm just hoping my gym stays open
Seen a tweet fae some dozy cunt saying China made #covid19 as a biological weapon.   Aye,  design a weapon that kills old folk.  Geez peace ya mangled fud!
The #coronavirus is a scam!! Africa and India are not shutting down and they are doing fine! Wake up!!!
Honestly at this point more people are going to die from the response to the virus than the actual virus itself. And that‚Äôs scary. #coronavirus
Social distancing? It's not halal, let's go out in thousands and protest. 		#coronavirus #coronavirusindia #StaySafeStayHome #COVID2019 #AntiCAAprotests
From my one module in Epidemiology in University I think I'm well placed to give my advice on the current pandemic which is..		'Wipe your lip and get on with it.'		You may return to your duties.		#coronavirus #covid19UK #COVID19 #giveover
84383+ patients of corona have recovered worldwide. Let us spread the good news and positivity.	Faith over Fear.üòá		#CoronaInPakistan #COVID19
Quarter teen and chill ? ü•µü§ï	#coronavirus
Why is coronavirus a big deal?! In public wear a mask and always carry hand sanitizer with you not butt load just the amount you need.		And always wash and rince vegetables when you get home. It's not so hard #coronavirus #coronavirustips
Ok.	My families life is potentially going to take a massive change in the next 24 hours, if not sooner.	All down to the hysteria regarding this #coronavirus .	200k case globally	8k deaths	The world melts.	Fucking stupidity on a grand scale.	Thanks a fucking lot you sheep....
I have this weird feeling that this is a VERY over dramatic way to try and reduce the impact on climate change... The press have fallen for it. The governments have fallen for it. Bet Greta Iceberg is rubbing her hands in glee at the thought of no travel! #coronavirus #COVID19
Wow!! Can't even go get my tooth fixed!! Dentist closing this some bullshit!!! #CoronavirusPandemic
Restaurants can take away their seating but that's not gunna stop me from sitting on the floor #coronavirus
Like I said on my #podcast .. do anyone at least know someone, that know someone, that know someone, that told them , that they know someone that told die from the #coronavirus ?? Anyone.? I wait ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You have got children crying their eyes out because they can't sit their GCSEs 	My niece doesn't want her predictive grades as she wanted to actually sit them.	Months she has been preparing herself	#fuckyou #covid19UK #schoolclosuresuk #coronavirus #pisstake
