be responsible to accept polices issuing by police department/ health departments! #curfew #CoronavirusOutbreak
#CoronavirusPandemic 	I think Gov.DeWine has waited too long to shut down the city. 159 yesterday, 247 today and how many more before the end of the day?
Put Gauteng on LOCKDOWN!!		Tough decision bt it is needed to prevent this #Coronavirus from spreading all over SA.		Once thos get to over 1000 next week it will be difficult to contain.		Leaders pls take unpopular decisions that will save SA lives.		People before profits
Having to modify some games we play with our toddler. 		This little piggy? Yeah, all of those toes are staying home. #covid19
Gotta shift our focus, IMHO*.		Less concern about getting #coronavirus test and more about following orders to #socialdistance and #stayhome. Test doesn’t cure. Assume everyone has it.		Social distancing and good hygiene are the spoonful of medicine we need.		*I’m not a doctor
Here’s a tip if you insist on going to a supermarket and queuing up. Place the length of the trolley between you and the person in front of you. That’s a nice distance so you at least put yourself at least risk. #SocialDistance #Covid_19
Keep safe everyone. Let's pray for one another in this trying time. 🙏🙏🙏	#COVID19	#StayAtHome
I have called an emergency meeting tomorrow of all head of the departments of PIMS to address all the important issues being faced by the medical staff &amp; patients. Safety of health workforce is my first priority while responding to #coronavirus &lt;265&gt;
I’m seven weeks pregnant and completely anxious about this virus. I’ve been staying inside my house for the past six days. Avoiding everyone but my husband. 😬 #Covid_19
It’s a massacre in Italy among the elderly born before 1940. They were kids playing when the bombs were falling during the war, the ones that built our Republic. We need to find a way to protect them. Other countries should do the same to shield that precious generation #COVID19
