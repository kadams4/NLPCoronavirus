I understand the concerns over the #CoronavirusPandemic but this is getting ridiculous. Thereâ€™s an illness that is 100% preventable and treatable. The world canâ€™t just stop. All these athletes and celebrities get time off from work while normal Americans....
The government is collecting our ðŸ§¬ DNA + developing human DNA bank of course. #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaOutbreak
Safe to say the west is a failed society. 		This is what happens when you trust the media, modern education, and the government.		#CoronavirusPandemic
This does not make any sense. Someone or someones are up to something. #CoronavirusPandemic
Can people, please ! CALM THE FUCK DOWN ! It's a nasty flu, and if you've 80 with one lung you're fucked ! Everyone else - PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemic
Your more likely to get killed by a drunk driver than the #coronavirus thatâ€™s the real epidemic #CoronavirusPandemic #FakeNews
Ill be damned if I let #coronavirus ruin my birthday plans. THE SHOW MUST GO ON
What is it with people being scared of corona itâ€™s a great drink #Covid_19
a doctor can diagnosis somebody who has a regular cold with having the corona virus it's no different then how they diagnosis people with having hpv when they just have an allergic reaction to something they are eating they don't care about your health  #Covid_19
