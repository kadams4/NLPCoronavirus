Had to go sit in the bathroom at work and cry tonight.	The company I work for is putting out ads encouraging people to come to their stores and buy stuff right now.	I'm angry.	I'm so fucking scared.	Fuck why won't this be over?? #COVID19 #coronavirus
Parenting in the time of #coronavirus: 		Playing outside w/my kid, we saw a preschool friend &amp; his dad. Friend, thrilled to see my kid, comes toward him. My kid shouts NO STAY BACK &amp; holds out a stick to keep friend away. Friend stops, confused. Tries again. Repeat.		üíî
My daughter has showed me her split 53 times in the 27 minutes I‚Äôve been home. The kids are struggling out here . Stay home so they can get out. Thanks. #COVID19
#COVID19 so glad my test came back #negative will still practice #socialdistancing and #staythefuckathome as I‚Äôm very immunosuppressed and want to live!!
It‚Äôs not the time to be such a smarta**. Stay home and stay alive! 	#LockDownNasionalSerentak 	#CoronaUpdate 	#CoronaIndonesia 	#COVID19 	#COVID19indonesia 	#DiRumahAjaYa
Weird progression: People that were calling COVID-19 a hoax or some sort of cooked up conspiracy are now sharing petitions for mandatory lockdown. #coronavirus #CoronaLockdown
You can buy 1200 ventillators at the cost of a single JF-17 block - 2 fighter airjet! While at the cost of orange line train you can get 49 JF-17s!	Unfortunately we hv a defense system, we all know!	#StayHomeStaySafe #CoronavirusOutbreak
I have so much anxiety over this virus, I now find myself having anxiety while watching movies/TV and seeing people not practicing social distancing. #Covid_19 #StayHome #CoronaLockdown
How is your mental during this time? #CoronavirusOutbreak #CoronaLockdown #StayHome #coronavirus
In light of this development, we need to get more serious about #COVID19 		No Sunday Church or any more gathering, stay home people.		Two persons testing positive means the clock is ticking, but we can slow down the spread by staying home now. #COVID19EnuguUpdate
If mwananchi doesn't stop for a moment the virus will not stop.Let us be change we seek and together all of us, tell your neighbor your friend to adhere to #CurfewinKenya Let us beat #COVID19 with known #VijanaTuepukeCorona

One of my friends will not follow her county's lockdow rules.  She is due back to work next week. Hmmmm #CoronaLockdown #COVID19 #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #SocialDistanacing #lockdown
#coronavirus is no joke. I feel so badly I‚Äôm shaking. I can‚Äôt keep anything down, I switch between being too cold or too cold (there is no in between) stay the fuck home
Should we start a GoFundMe to help buy ventilators for the hospitals in states where elected officials don't kiss Trump's ass?		We can't do nothing and let people die because the president is a narcissistic sociopath. 		#Covid_19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #StayHome
Need someone to watch Netflix with (obviously via netflix party due to #CoronaLockdown ); now accepting applications....thanks #NetflixAndStayStill #coronavirus #COVID2019 #CoronavirusPandemic

My parents have both tested positive for COVID. My mother is, so far, asymptomatic,  but my stepdad is in ICU.  Please do what you have to to help contain the spread of this. #coronavirus #Covid19usa #COVID #CoronaLockdown #CoronavirusOutbreak #thisepisodesucks
Staying home and self quarantining is not even remotely possible for those who are homeless. Which is why it falls on us as citizens of the world to SPEAK UP and DEMAND our elected officials take clear concise measures to assist the most vulnerable members of society #coronavirus
It‚Äôs sad to see, read &amp; hear that ppl only take the #coronavirus serious if it hits close to home. If they don‚Äôt personally know someone with the illness or if they feel well, they don‚Äôt care. Or, some are in straight denial leading to some reckless decisions &amp; costing lives. Smh
How's quarantine going for u guy's? #Quarantine #CoronaVirusChallenge #follobackforfolloback #follo4follo #follotrick #follo4folloback #Covid19usa #COVID2019 #Covid_19 #StayHomeSaveLives #StayHome

If there is one good thing this virus has done, is uniting Americans. I am starting to see on my social media feed a universal message. Let's curve this trajectory and let's flatten the curve TOGETHER #StayHome #COVID19 #SocialDistancing
It is most painful situation to be in that one of your family member is dying and you know you can not help or meet them. He dies without goodbye. 	Worst is still to come to us. Let‚Äôs prevent it before it‚Äôs too late.	Stay home and stay safe.	#CoronavirusOutbreak .

#coronavirus  pandemic proved that humanity in big shit (gran mierda).	People spreading the virus deliberately, others refusing the isolation or quarantine, other hoarding on supplies and scumbags are stealing. 	What is this?	#CoronaLockdown 	#COVID19 	#CoronavirusOutbreak
Here‚Äôs an obvious tip, when showing footage on news services of pre this virus outbreak. Maybe a banner or something. Because when you see people shaking hands, kissing &amp; hugging maybe just maybe you‚Äôre sending confusing messages to people watching the news #coronavirus #skynews
Oh my god. Why did the people I live with decide to invite people over? What the actual fuck. People really need to stay in their own home. I am not trying to get the #Coronavirus Not today, Satan.
#Italy records almost 1,000 virus deaths in the last 24 hours. Sad to see even now a lot of our people not taking the #Coronavirus seriously and roaming around unnecessarily in the roads. PLEASE PLEASE STAY HOME 		#CoronaLockdown

I live in a rural community, a block from our hospital. Ambulance sirens seem frequent. #CoronaLockdown #coronavirus #StayHome n
I went to Walmart today. There were tons of people there that weren‚Äôt social distancing nor taking the necessary precautions to safeguard themselves. People are still treating this situation lightly. We should brace ourselves for a lot more cases. #Coronavirus
With more than 100 new cases in 24hrs, #India crosses 800 mark of #COVID19 patients. 		#StayAwareStaySafe #StayHomeStaySafe
Just took a #SelfCareAndSocialDistance walk/run to get some fresh air and clear my head. I was pleased to take a second to make some noise for our healthcare workers on the frontline fighting #COVID19. #Grateful #UniteLR
Medical spouses are the new military spouses.		#coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #StayHomeSaveLives
Provision of free hand sanitizers, distribution of free nose masks to the market men and women won't be a bad start. Intervention centers properly equipped should be made available and their locations made known to the public.	#COVID19 	#StayAtHomeAndStaySafe 	#AbiaState
It is really hard when your great-grandmother wants you to come visit her. But being considered a "essential employee" in the community...I just can't risk it. #coronavirus #NCLockdown #restaurantworker
Shout out to all the quarantine nonachievers! No clean closets, organized homes, craft projects, nothin. We rocked the snacks and naps and stupid movies! Carry on...#coronavirus 	#QuarantineLife 	#stuckathome	#Wereallinthistogether
Friends, anyone who might know:		are there any grocery stores currently NOT letting customers in, and doing #curbside pickup instead? 		I feel like that could work really well 		#COVID19 #staythefuckhome #dotcom

The State government should make use of the Corp members currently serving, make use of youths who are ready to volunteer. Proper sensitization should be done so that everyone understands the importance of staying at home now. 	#COVID19 	#StayAtHomeAndStaySafe	#AbiaState
