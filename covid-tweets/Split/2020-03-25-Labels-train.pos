My life and the lives of many who are forced to work during this virus are being put in danger by people who are "bored of being home" or "don't care what happens" which means my life is worthless in their eyes. What are other people worth to you? #COVID19

Unless you too can rise from the dead I suspect Easter will be a bad time to stop practicing social distancing and #coronavirus mitigation efforts.
Everyone, if walking along the road for exercise or to get essentials pls make #SocialDistancing easier by walking in the direction of the traffic where possible and remember what 2m looks like #CoronavirusLockdown #Covid19Out #COVID19 #coronavirus
My old dear is a recovering breast cancer victim. She is also a Nurse at East Surrey hospital (NHS), working as part of our front line staff tackling #COVID19. All the government are asking you to do is to #StayAtHome. Don’t be an ignorant moron! #StayAtHomeSaveLives
As a pharmacy tech that has patients, friends, &amp; family on forms of chloroquine/hydroxychloriquine for legitimate reasons, I'm gonna put this bluntly: folks taking/hoarding these medications &amp; the doctors prescribing them for off-label use to treat #COVID19  should be ashamed.
Help us &amp; the NHS save lives by staying at home. Essential travel only. Follow the government guidelines. We will be stopping people across our area &amp; challenging you to prove your reason for travelling and being out and about #StayAtHomeSaveLives #coronavirus #999onthefrontline
We are passing through a Pandemic #covid19. India Lock down from 25th March to 14th April' 2020. So, Stay at home &amp; be safe. Save yours &amp; save others too. Only medicine of Corona virus is To Stay Home &amp; Stay Safe.

Can someone explain to our leaders that it's not considered shutdown/social distancing/reducing cross infection, if people are freely allowed to ride public transport/cars,leave their children to mingle at daycares &amp; kill time by multiple grocery store shopping trips #COVID19
It has been an #Emotional &amp; #Physical #Breaking say. The grocery worker in #Oshawa diagnosed with #COVID19 forced me to realize the risks my Mother is taking as a #GroceryCashier.  Also I've been #SelfIsolated for the last 12 days due to a fever at my last #PainClinic appt. 1/5
I have been sick for 14 days now, symptoms waxing and waning throughout, yesterday I felt like my lungs were filled with glass, it only improves when I take 500mg naproxen and even then I can still feel it. I still can’t get tested.  #coronavirus #COVID19
If you are having trouble staying home with all the bells and whistles that a majority of us have, maybe just think about somebody like Anne Frank.  #coronavirus #CanadaCovid19
Never heard as many sirens in Brooklyn as I have tonight. Feel lucky to be able to #StayAtHome &amp; be safe in my apt. 		Thinking of our 1st responders who are also running low on #PPE &amp; overwhelmed in this #COVID19 crisis. 		Pray for #NYC y’all 🙏🏽
Flights are still packed! Crazy!!!! They should be seating passengers only on the window seat and on every other aisle! 1A 1F 3A 3F 5A 5F 7A 7F and so on! Believe me!!! How has no airline thought of this yet! #covid19 #coronavirus #airlinesafety #stopcovid19 #passengersafety
Only in the #Philippines. A Senator who’s positive with #COVID19 didn’t give a rat’s ass about #quarantinePh and went to the hospital’s delivery room with his pregnant wife and sister in law. To hell with other people he endangered, he wanted to go. Shame on you! Burn in hell!
Dr. Devi Shetty on CNBC interview says there will be at least 80000 positive cases in Karnataka alone in next 10-12 days. If we aren’t serious about Social Distancing then we are fucked. #CoronavirusLockdown #CoronavirusPandemic
I don't understand the point of shutting all these different places down for 14 days, when there is still a lot of places open. They need to shut everything down  besides grocery stores, drugstores, gas stations, and the LCBO so the ladies can get their wine! #COVID19
New after work routine 	1. Remove boots outside	2. Remove work cloths in basement &amp; wash them.	3. Wash hands b4 going upstairs 	4. Shower	 #COVID19 #coronavirus #EssentialWorkers #electrician #CoronavirusLockdown #LetsFightCovid19

It honestly astounds me that people are still going out and socialising with others outside their household. 		Stop being selfish. Stop putting the NHS under more strain. Stop putting people at risk. 		All together now: STOP👏BEING👏SELFISH👏		#COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown
Understand something: the more insulation works... THE MORE INSULATION WE NEED! #BeResponsible #StayHome #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirusbrasil
The best solution to fight the #COVID19 pandemic in Cameroon is a total lockdown. If things get worse, we neither have the infrastructure, nor the money, nor the expertise, and looking at the behavior of some top state officials, we might not even have the goodwill to fight it.
I just realized today that the #covid19 Global Pandemic is the world’s longest and worst game of ‘The floor is lava’.  Please, don’t leave your home unless you really need to.
Do not..I repeat do not get a prescription of #Plaquenil if you do not have an autoimmune disorder..you are only adding to the shortage problem! #Hydroxychloroquine It is not yet known as a cure or prevention against #coronavirus!
(2/3) #COVID19 My Mom was tearing up while telling me what happened. They WORKED HARD to prepare the food for the soldiers but their team was just SCOLDED for "blocking" the traffic and that they won't accept it for UNKNOWN REASONS, considering there's NO other VEHICLE passing by
According to Science experts; fly could infect people from #coronavirus. Be aware, be prepared, stay home home, stay away from fly, and keep good hygiene to be safe.	#Lockdown21 #coronavirusindia #IndiaFightsCorona #StopTheSpreadOfCorona
You know what, #COVID19 does not move, we move. We stop &gt; #COVID19 stops? We move, it moves? 	You know the key now? Please #StayHomeAustralia 	#covid19australia
What kind of world do we live in where young people (a small minority, not all) will say it's only killing the elderly so it doesnt matter. Since when do we not care if our elders are dying? #coronavirus
even thought the #coronavirus cancelled all my fun trips, I can’t help but feel even more grateful to be home with mama and pops. my absolute people. ♡ even if they won’t hug me.
The #coronavirus does not recognize borders, it's a global problem that we have to fight together, your flippant or irresponsible behavior could be a death sentence for someone #stayathome
Much needed day off after some very mentally and emotionally challenging shifts but thoughts still with my fab team of colleagues still doing it for the NHS #COVID19 #NurseTwitter

I'm watching the news: they're juxtaposing footage of Mayor Garcetti &amp; Gov. Newsome (asking people to stay indoors) with footage of CROWDS of people playing soccer at a park and another group skating in Venice. I am beyond furious with the selfish people. #COVID19 #StayHome
If you know a healthcare worker or first responder, reach out to them to say thank you and see how they are doing.  Stay safe, stay healthy. 2/2	#COVID19	#WeAreInThisTogether

So #tennisfam and #Nolefam		I’ve been told not to work as of today as my employer has temporarily shut down for the first time in 35 yrs!		I will find a way but thoughts with those who are severely impacted.		Would love to know how #coronavirus has affected you. Pls share below
Please stay indoors if at all possible and take care of eachother. You do not want this or to pass it onto others #COVID19 #coronavirus #CoronaIreland #Isolation #Quarantine #StayHomeSaveLives
We will all eventually be infected with #COVID19, short of having a vaccine available. The point is to decrease the rate of spread, and avoid exposing those most vulnerable. That’s what #FlattenTheCurve means, and why #PPENow for healthcare workers is an absolute necessity.
If you find that Government guidance is not clear, just use common sense. It’s not difficult. #staysafe #StayAtHome #COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown #commonsense
TRAVELLERS: you MUST quarantine for 14 days!! there are people who think they’re safe because they don’t have symptoms, and still go to grocery stores. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. having no symptoms for a week doesn’t rule you out and there’s EVIDENCE BEHIND THAT. #COVID19 #COVIDOntario
