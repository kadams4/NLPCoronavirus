My life and the lives of many who are forced to work during this virus are being put in danger by people who are "bored of being home" or "don't care what happens" which means my life is worthless in their eyes. What are other people worth to you? #COVID19

Unless you too can rise from the dead I suspect Easter will be a bad time to stop practicing social distancing and #coronavirus mitigation efforts.
Everyone, if walking along the road for exercise or to get essentials pls make #SocialDistancing easier by walking in the direction of the traffic where possible and remember what 2m looks like #CoronavirusLockdown #Covid19Out #COVID19 #coronavirus
My old dear is a recovering breast cancer victim. She is also a Nurse at East Surrey hospital (NHS), working as part of our front line staff tackling #COVID19. All the government are asking you to do is to #StayAtHome. Don‚Äôt be an ignorant moron! #StayAtHomeSaveLives
As a pharmacy tech that has patients, friends, &amp; family on forms of chloroquine/hydroxychloriquine for legitimate reasons, I'm gonna put this bluntly: folks taking/hoarding these medications &amp; the doctors prescribing them for off-label use to treat #COVID19  should be ashamed.
Help us &amp; the NHS save lives by staying at home. Essential travel only. Follow the government guidelines. We will be stopping people across our area &amp; challenging you to prove your reason for travelling and being out and about #StayAtHomeSaveLives #coronavirus #999onthefrontline

Can someone explain to our leaders that it's not considered shutdown/social distancing/reducing cross infection, if people are freely allowed to ride public transport/cars,leave their children to mingle at daycares &amp; kill time by multiple grocery store shopping trips #COVID19
It has been an #Emotional &amp; #Physical #Breaking say. The grocery worker in #Oshawa diagnosed with #COVID19 forced me to realize the risks my Mother is taking as a #GroceryCashier.  Also I've been #SelfIsolated for the last 12 days due to a fever at my last #PainClinic appt. 1/5
I have been sick for 14 days now, symptoms waxing and waning throughout, yesterday I felt like my lungs were filled with glass, it only improves when I take 500mg naproxen and even then I can still feel it. I still can‚Äôt get tested.  #coronavirus #COVID19

Dr. Devi Shetty on CNBC interview says there will be at least 80000 positive cases in Karnataka alone in next 10-12 days. If we aren‚Äôt serious about Social Distancing then we are fucked. #CoronavirusLockdown #CoronavirusPandemic
I don't understand the point of shutting all these different places down for 14 days, when there is still a lot of places open. They need to shut everything down  besides grocery stores, drugstores, gas stations, and the LCBO so the ladies can get their wine! #COVID19

The best solution to fight the #COVID19 pandemic in Cameroon is a total lockdown. If things get worse, we neither have the infrastructure, nor the money, nor the expertise, and looking at the behavior of some top state officials, we might not even have the goodwill to fight it.
I just realized today that the #covid19 Global Pandemic is the world‚Äôs longest and worst game of ‚ÄòThe floor is lava‚Äô.  Please, don‚Äôt leave your home unless you really need to.
Do not..I repeat do not get a prescription of #Plaquenil if you do not have an autoimmune disorder..you are only adding to the shortage problem! #Hydroxychloroquine It is not yet known as a cure or prevention against #coronavirus!

What kind of world do we live in where young people (a small minority, not all) will say it's only killing the elderly so it doesnt matter. Since when do we not care if our elders are dying? #coronavirus

Please stay indoors if at all possible and take care of eachother. You do not want this or to pass it onto others #COVID19 #coronavirus #CoronaIreland #Isolation #Quarantine #StayHomeSaveLives
We will all eventually be infected with #COVID19, short of having a vaccine available. The point is to decrease the rate of spread, and avoid exposing those most vulnerable. That‚Äôs what #FlattenTheCurve means, and why #PPENow for healthcare workers is an absolute necessity.
If you find that Government guidance is not clear, just use common sense. It‚Äôs not difficult. #staysafe #StayAtHome #COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown #commonsense
TRAVELLERS: you MUST quarantine for 14 days!! there are people who think they‚Äôre safe because they don‚Äôt have symptoms, and still go to grocery stores. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. having no symptoms for a week doesn‚Äôt rule you out and there‚Äôs EVIDENCE BEHIND THAT. #COVID19 #COVIDOntario
