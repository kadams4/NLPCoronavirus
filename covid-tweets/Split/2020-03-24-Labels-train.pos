I really wish all counties in Houston would put out a "Stay at home" order. I live in #galvestoncounty but work in #Harriscounty so now I'm all sorts of confused. #coronavirus #COVID19 #Texas
End of day for #COVID19 new cases is here: US daily growth was 29.7%, down from 38.7% yesterday. A lot better than I expected. 		Must keep going. We will get to the end of this nightmare together.		#StayHome
It's the perfect time to make a huge clean up of our lives, the real one and the virtual one. I think. #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus #StayHome #march2020
America loves being #1 &amp; now Trump gonna make us #1 in #COVID19 infected &amp; deaths if he forces all shutdowns to end. Just to get the Stockmarket going.		Again Republicans	Profit over peoples lives.		#RepublicansAreKillingUs 	#TrumpLiesAmericansDie 	#TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER
Well I thought for sure this stupid #coronavirus wouldn‚Äôt hit my rural town. We didn‚Äôt shut down any shops or anything. Now a guy is getting tested now with symptoms. My brother and I are isolating ourselves until results come infor kids and parents sake. I miss my kids.
If you found out today you were positive with the virus, would you be proud of your interactions the last few days in public? How many people would you have to notify that you potentially infected them? Keep that in mind for tomorrow. #COVIDActNow  #COVID19

New York needs 30,000 ventilators. They NEED.	Can you even imagine 30,000 people on ventilators lined up?	How many people are needed to take care of just one?	#StayHome #COVID19
If Taylor Swift can disappear from the public eye for an entire year without anyone seeing her, y‚Äôall can stay home for a couple weeks without going anywhere non essential. Geez. #Michigan #shelterinplace #coronavirus

Anyone else really looking forward to April first and finding out this whole thing is a massive prank? #covid19 #corona2020 	#coronavirusuk #LockdownNow #StayAtHomeSaveLives #AprilFools
A global pandemic is not the time to exercise your civil rights. It's the time to sit down shut up and stop getting people sick. 	#covid19 	This is why the US is doomed.
Hey, guys. Remember, like, 3 weeks ago, when things were mostly normal?	.	.	.	Yeah, me neither. #covid19 #StayHome

Fijians have extended Families. If one gets #COVID19 there are high chances of 5 or more household members getting infected. Our Country may not have the means to cater for this PANDEMIC!!! Think before you leave your homes &amp; think of the LIVES at stake.
I haven‚Äôt left my house in 5 days, which really isn‚Äôt that long yet, but I think it‚Äôs actually the longest time I‚Äôve ever done that in my adult life. Might as well set a personal record. #COVID19 #StayHome
This is no joke. I‚Äôm running a low fever. I now know of 6 ppl sick, 2 confirmed virus. 		PLEASE don‚Äôt listen to our President or other politicians in denial. Listen to medical experts. I‚Äôm on lockdown anyway but for sure won‚Äôt leave the house for 2 weeks. 	#COVID19
I can't decide what im more outraged about at the moment. The spring break idiots or the parents who named their kid Dick Pound.  #COVIDIOTS #IOC #coronavirus
Fellow Indians, this request comes from a banker who has to go to office everyday to keep the system running. Please try to use net banking/mobile banking and come to the bank only for utmost necessities. Not for passbooks/ph no updation. Let's fight this together. ‚úåÔ∏è#covid19
PSA: We should already be taking Vitamin D supplements on the regs considering our side of the world doesn't get much sun but if you don't, now's a pretty good time to start cause #socialdistancing during #Quarantine means even less ‚òÄÔ∏è.  #StayHome but #stayhealthy too! #COVID19
Trump is definitely not interested in workers, the unemployed, the poor... any of us. #COVID19 #TrumpSlushFund is a joke. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #StayAtHomeSaveLives #QuarantineAndChill
Just stay home as simple as that! You want your loved ones to be affected with corona virus? Fuck no!! Then stay fucking home! #coronavirus #lockdownuk

California friends! In light of park/beach closures due to crowds, here‚Äôs a list of ways we can all help:		1. STAY THE FUCK HOME.		#CoronavirusPandemic #Quarantine
Really want to throat punch my brother and sister in law. They are not taking self isolation seriously, at all, and are endangering my nephew aka my favorite human on the GD planet. We're in Florida and most Floridians also aren't taking this shit seriously. #COVID19 #StayHome
Self-quarantine feeds my anxiety, but what absolutely makes my anxiety sky rocket is the thought that this president could just undo it all in a week for the sake of the economy, ignoring the fact that the economy will crash if we undo it all. #COVID19 #StayHome
The President and GOP lawmakers calling on workers to go back to work after next week is an insane policy. Not only will it result in a vastly higher death toll than sustained shelter-in-place, the economy will STILL tank if millions get sick. #COVID19
Do something!!!	Quarantine everyone for 2 weeks until this shit is gone #Coronavirus
This one is for the history books along with the plague, 1918 flu etc		The decisions we all make play a huge part in how this unfolds for the future generations		Hopefully they will look back in decades from now at the wise choices we all made #Covid19 #StayAtHomeSaveLives #NHS
#coronavirus  is having so high attitude/ or like high attitude relative,  it won't come to our home. We need to go out and bring it. #StayHomeIndia #StayHomeSaveLives

Chatted with some religious people and they strongly believe that religion can protect them from Covid19. Yes/maybe but extra caution won‚Äôt hurt. It‚Äôs time we use social influencers such as religious, indigenous leaders, etc to convey the safety message #SocialDistancing #COVID19
Italy has the worlds 2nd best health care system where india ranked at 112th.	Just Imagine the consequences if you don't lockdown. 	So its better to stay in your home for the next 10 days.	#StayAtHomeSaveLives	#CoronavirusPandemic #Covid19India

In the US, young Americans are getting sick too. 12% of intensive care patients are 20-44 years. Patients are between 20-54 in hospitalizations. Young people can get it ! 53% of cases in NY are people from ages 18-49. We are all at risk #StayHome #coronavirus #COVID19 #usa

So I lost my job/s because of #COVID19. And knowing that theres no job anymore and still finishing the final shift was pretty bad feeling. As long as everyone is safe and this thing calms down, I think I am ok with it. No income but yes I will be ok. #australialockdown
I need Evangelicals to stop trying to contact isolated Amazon tribes during the pandemic.		My ancestors did not want contact prior to 1492 and I am sure they do not want it now #StayHome #COVID19

Distance is power against #COVID19!  #StayHome and do your part to help stop this thing in its tracks!  1st responders &amp; all those on the front lines need you to!  Feel helpless? Want to do something? THIS is how you will make a difference!  Be the example!
I think it might help if people either 65+ or younger but medically compromised to share #AtRisk &amp; say why they need EVERYONE to stay home to help people understand. People may not realize who they are putting at risk around them.		#COVID19 #COVID #StaySafe #StayAtHomeSaveLives
The rhetoric of it being a good thing that it takes more confirmed cases in the US before we even match the number of deaths of other countries is appalling. 		That does not make it okay to ease on our response to this outbreak. 		#SocialDistancing #covid19 #Coronavirus #StayHome

Ok. So we are self-isolating and staying at home, playing our parts. What's the government doing in their part - apart from quarantining? Or are we just gonna all come out of self-isolation in 2-3weeks, and boom! We were all safe again? #COVID19 #Coronavirustoronto
My true talent of being a homebody is absolutely paying off now.  Years of preparation and now I can shine!!! #StayAtHome #COVID19 #ihavenolife
Some people just don‚Äôt get it! Social distancing means stay the fuck home and only interact with those in your immediate household and only go out when absolutely necessary. If you‚Äôre still going out to hang out with your friends to habe fun, you‚Äôre part of the problem!! #COVID19
To anyone not self-isolating.		I blame you if you ruin my summer plans of pints in beer gardens...... 		The quicker we begin self to self isolate the quicker this all ends.		Don't make this stretch on longer than necessary		#COVID19ireland #Coronavirus
#ukcoronavirus #UKGoverment the government is still not serious they should close essential and non essential and provide for people whatever they need there is a way Uk is a stable country please lockdown everything this way we can save life‚Äôs #CoronavirusBillUK #coronavirus
Highly disappointed in Africans in general, why am I still seeing people going to clubs and restaurants to flex on IG? 		It was all shits &amp; giggles when we told ourselves that black people cannot be infected by #COVID19 but NEWSFLASH, we are not immune.
We can‚Äôt just give up on social distancing, but we can‚Äôt let the economy collapse. In cases like these, we need a strong, measured response from our government. #government #economy #COVID19
Yo I‚Äôm showing myself so much love right now.. I‚Äôm trying to get right for when quarantine is over! #coronavirus #COVID19 #QuarantineLife #LockdownNow #KungFluFighting #StayAtHomeSaveLives #WhereIsFauci
Dear everyone, because schools and offices have been shot down does not mean it‚Äôs time for hospital check-up,kindly stay at home if it‚Äôs not a severe case. I can‚Äôt believe amidst the #covid19 out break people are still flooding the hospital for reasons best known to them. Smh
If you're getting in your car for things other than food, work, medical or anything essential, please get back in your house. Just think The Nightstalker Serial Killer/The Smoke Monster/The Boogeyman is on the loose and you need to stay safe indoors. #COVID19 #SocialDistancing
There‚Äôs nothing more profound than being part of something greater than oneself. I‚Äôm amazed by the courage, selflessness, &amp; determination of my fellow health care profs in battling #coronavirus . Every day we go to work is just as imp as every day that you choose to stay home. üôèüèΩ

Every day, more and more places are closing. It is so important for everyone to take COVID-19 seriously and stay home and keep your distance. Don‚Äôt go out unless you have to. The only way this ends is if we all do this. #coronavirus #StayHome

Love is the ultimate solution to stop further spread of covid-19. If you love yourself you will stay at home, if you love your family &amp; friends, you love yourself üòâ #COVID19
