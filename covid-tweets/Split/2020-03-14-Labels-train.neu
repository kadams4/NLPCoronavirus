Do you remember when Biff from Back to the Future attempted to make a few dollars by utilising the futuristic Almanac? We can be like Biff, albeit not for gambling purposes, by reading the Italian and Spanish press. #ukcorona #coronavirus #COVID19
At the Monroe County #coronavirus press conference today, officials must explain why they kept crucial information from the public at their last press conference. If you told us half the story then, what aren't you telling us now? Transparency builds trust and confidence.
Stage1⃣️ There is very limited infection, no need to worry, nothing going to happen. 	Stage2⃣️ Maybe something is going to happen but we should do nothing about it. 	Stage3⃣️ Maybe we should do something about it, but there is Nothing we can do.	👍🏼🇺🇸🇸🇪🇬🇧🇳🇱🇦🇺🇳🇿🇨🇦	#COVID19
Am I alone in thinking that jumping to conclusions from currently available data on #COVIDー19 &amp; estimating probabilities etc= dangerous because a)margin of error on available data is potentially higher than usual as b)#coronavirus =moving target with constantly evolving dataset?
I can't believe it. Leaned out of my window, delivered a perfectly proficient rendition of Psychosocial and nobody joined in.		You can all do one, neighbours. 		#coronavirus #coronaUK #COVID_19uk #COVIDー19
Stuck at home? Now is a great time to catch up on those home renovation projects. #toiletpapercrisis #covid19 #DIY #covid19Canada #covid19vancouver
Could the #bachelor have ended at a worse time? Always fighting my #wife over the remote. Now no sports and the only thing on is the #news and #Covid_19
It is a thing of epic proportions that a marginal twist of the smallest of particles has shut down commerce, sports, and has the potential to overwhelm the best of our healthcare systems. Little things...don’t dismiss the little things. #COVID19
Shame on #VRBO Refusing any refund despite Disney World closing.  #coronavirus
Anyone else got so good at washing their hands that their hands are now actually getting quite sore? #COVID19 #coronavirus #Covid_19
Buying all the items in high demand and selling them for high profit doesn't make you an entrepreneur, it's just makes you an asshole.   Don't get it twisted boo boo.  You're an asshole asking for bitch karma to pay you a visit #COVID19 #coronavirus
This weekend, all social activity has been suspended. Absolutely, no social activity. No more social animal. It’s time to be advanced digital social animal.		#work8home #social #digital #COVID19
Awkward moment when British people don't agree with government how they deal with the situation but can't even protest cos mass gatherings are banned! #coronavirus
When the #COVID19 calms, how much food will be going to the tip cause 1) out of date 2) actually don't really like it just bought it cause everyone else was.
We are about to discover that lots of things aren’t necessary—- face to face college courses, office jobs, doctors office visits. Nearly everything can be done from home #COVIDー19 #coronavirus #CoronaOutbreak #SaturdayThoughts
Cathy Go is pawer! ❤️ #ReignForever #VictoryWorship #COVID19
Think about this for a minute, there are millions of homeless people in America, who have no clue about the #CoronavirusPandemic since they don't have access to the internet. They are carriers and will spread the disease even more.
I can't help but feel that this whole toilet paper shortage could've been avoided if the Three Seashells from Demolition Man had been invented #coronavirus
Can you tell I'm just done with the ignorance?  #COVID19
The idea of self quarantining for 14 days makes me a little giddy 😁	But then I remembered I'd probably have to quarantine the kids as well 🤦🏼‍♀️		#coronapocalypse #QuarantineAndChill #coronavirus #CoronaOutbreak #COVID #TeamSerranoTweets
The air around the world is cleaner, less pollutants entering the sea, streets are less noisy. Families are spending time together, less planes flying around the world, luxury cruise ships are not dirtying up the sea.....#Covid19 - Just another perspective. 1/2
One things for certain with the coronavirus and that's the exponential rate of people learning what exponential means. #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates #CoronaOutbreak
Yesterday a Brexiteer was tweeting and hollering about how the UK isn't going to be at the back of the line and that being exempt from the US travel ban was a sign. Well. The UK and Ireland are part of the ban now... bet that tweet sounds really clever now, huh? #CoronaVirus
After the Tory's won last election why are ppl surprised that there is much #selfishness in #UK. #COVID19
If we vigorously attacked #Policing &amp; the #CriminalJusticeSystem like the #Coronavirus we could save over 1k Black and Brown bodies annually and #EndMassIncarceration in 2weeks with Sweeping Legislation. Declare #PoliceBrutality a National State of Emergency. #StayOnTheUpnUp
For some of you, it’s still house arrest. Don’t pretend. #coronavirus
Fight with the disaster like #Coronavirus	CCultivate the habit of doing Namaste 🙏and say no to Shake hand 🤝🚫	Indian culture can neutralise such evil.	#ProudToBeAHindu 	#CoronaVirusUpdates
Just started on my quarantine snacks. I’ll be out by Tuesday. #coronavirus
I would like to say for the record that I successfully missed all panic buying. Beijing is the place to be for #covid19 I swear.
#IDTwitter looking for the best resources you came across on duration of respiratory shedding in confirmed #covid19 cases and on persistence of it on surfaces. Much appreciated. I'll start with one.
Flying today.	Enjoying watching people elbow bump, peace sign or foot tap to greet  friends and family!	#COVID19
#covid19alberta 	#COVIDー19 	#CoronaVirusCanada 	#coronavirus 	For all the people i will see taking more toilet paper then you need I hope you can fight cuz you gonna  have to fight to keep your shit if I see it
What are you supposed to do if you drool when you sleep? Asking for a friend. #COVID19
Prediction: at no other time will we see #wokeness like it than over #COVID19 in the UK press
If #COVIDー19 has taught us anything it's the lengths that people go to when desperate. Next time you judge migrants, refugees fleeing from war - Remember we literally fought over toilet paper. It's always "them", never "we". Introspection, fellas. Have it.		#Coronavirus #Racism
Question of the day: Is it really necessary to buy out all the toilet paper and soap? Makes them look like they’ve just inherited a P*rn collection 🤷🏻‍♂️😂 #coronavirus
Everyone is stocking up on toilet paper, but no one is stocking up on toothpaste or mouthwash. So you’ll have clean assess, but a dirty mouth? #coronavirus
For someone who has family and friends in Italy, seeing the behaviors of some European governments is like watching a movie we know how it ends, while desperately screaming at the protagonists to do something. #Covid_19 #StayHomeBelgium #StayHomeEurope
We are currently watching our son’s college team at Denison University streaming playing in the snow and cold. Best game on tv today! #COVID19 #MLB #NCAA #MarchMadness #BaseBall #SpringBreak #SportsRelief2020 #Denison
#CoronaVirus proves Levy will be with us forever until he dies or gets too old ... Levy is full of luck and this as mad as it sounds may have saved his season again.		#THFC
This pandemic is really bringing out the best in some and the worst in other. Hearing stories of people volunteering to do the weekly shop for elderly, followed by stories of people stealing hand sanitizer from hospitals. Absolute madness #coronavirus #Covid_19 #coronvirusireland
I was told yesterday that I’m not allowed to cancel the annual leave I have booked 6th-9th April (lead up to Easter weekend) because of the new #COVID19 rules at work (😡). I now have no work NOR PLANS from 3rd to 13th April. What can I do, Twitter?!
Going to use this extended break from school to take a deep dive into a hobby that my profession doesn’t normally allow me to do-mustache growing. By the time the break ends I should have enough growth to keep people away from me for a considerable amount of time. #coronavirus
At the juncture of midnight today, the number of confirmed #coronavirus patients in #Pune district to 15 and that in #Maharashtra to 31. The total number of infected patients in #India has reached 102.
By Official Proclamation I am hereby banning all congregations near me in excess of 3 people. I am at the limit, so leave me the fuck alone. #coronavirus
I’m worried that the US elections will be postponed over #covid19. Might seem crazy but the UK just postponed theirs
Corona really messing with my money. Cancelled events for March and April. Thank god credit cards were made 🙏 #coronapocalypse #QuarantineAndChill #coronavirus #Covid_19
I grew up as a homeschooler in the 90s... Basically, I’m professionally trained in this social distancing stuff.		#homeschool #90s #SocialDistancing #COVID19 #coronavirus
If I get sent home from work for #COVID19 I might finally put away the clean clothes on the kitchen table
Please stop talking. #Coronavirus
On #REFLECTION #2020 has been a shit year already. Countless #storms and bad #weather and now #COVID19 .
