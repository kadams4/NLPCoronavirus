Oh #coronavirus, how I miss the days when the worst thing that could happen to me from hooking up on #tinder was being murdered.
As of Friday at 6pm when I clock out I will be out of work for the foreseeable future. #COVID19 #StayAtHome
there are #nurses out there using masks, low on supplies....why are the big business that we’ve helped...not helping us #COVID19 #StayHome #flatteningthecurve
It’s not just the #coronavirus deaths we have to worry about. If the hospitals are at capacity and you get in a car accident and need to be put on a ventilator, how do you think that’s gonna work out for you?
Weird thing to be grateful for but I’m grateful my father in law died the week before #COVID19 really hit the US so his granddaughters could say goodbye &amp; we could have a proper funeral. Thinking of the families who can’t do that right now and I’m so sad for them all #coronavirus
People still gathering on beaches and in parks I'm not going to lie I thought #coronavirus was going to go away like sars etc but this is big and is yet to peak and yet I'm still seeing what only can be described as attempted murderers gathering #SatyHomeStaySafe
I’m amazed &amp; grateful for all the technology that has kept me connected to so many during this quarantine including watching a movie w/10 other people, group FaceTime &amp; even attended a birthday party on zoom #CoronavirusLockdown #QuarantineLife #COVID19
This is a war! We've got innocent civilians and people on the front line dying! To the right thing and #ShelterInPlace #coronavirus
