Things getting so scary	#coronavirus
Heartbreaking to see the pictures of lines outside pawning centres in #lka in the face of #curfew as part of #coronavirus containment measures. Please do what u can to help those who are underprivileged in this time of crisis! üôè #COVID19 #CoronaOutbreak #CoronavirusLK #SriLanka
Just found out from a family friend that the majority of deaths have been Muslims. PLEASE stop socialising, stop going to the mosques and spreading the virus! You can pray at home!!! üò°		#Coronavirus #COVID19 #CoronaPandemic
If flattening the curve is our collective goal, and we need everyone to participate for it to be effective, how are we measuring success if we‚Äôre not establishing mass testing facilities and tracking positive cases? Someone explain... #Covid19
Husband has just text ....‚Äùmums popping up tomorrow‚Äù ..... errr no she‚Äôs not mate üò∑ seriously what part of STAY AT FUCKING HOME DON‚ÄôT PEOPLE FUCKING UNDERSTAND. Jesus wept. #coronavirus
Indian government could not foresee the danger coming. India is going to be hit by #COVID19 soon.
How about the suspected case of Corona virus in ondo state Nigeria, for which i heard sample has been taken for test.	Is the result not ready yet?	We have been awaiting the result - is it positive or negative. #COVID19 	#ondo
I stay at work for you, please stay at home for us #mta #coronavirus #SocialDistancing
"Stay at home" order is a RECOMMENDATION. They cant FORCE you. But yes, if everyone just STAYS INSIDE. We can do our best to knock this crap out sooner, rather than later.	üëç	#visalia #california #covid-19 #coronavirus #shelterinplace #stayathome #selfisolation #2020
Dear God.  On behalf of the human race, I would like to apologise for being stupid. (although I'm not one of the stupid ones, I'm just talking on their behalf).  P. S.  You're welcome to take the extra stupid ones.  The rest of us will do better.  Promise.  #Covid_19 #coronavirus
Just remember, we made it through 9/11, sever tornados, fires, hurricanes, floods, and even wars. We can get though this COVID-19. Find music, humor, patience, kindness, and love and we will get through this. #QuarentineLife #coronavirus #StaySafeStayHome
Listen. When I tell you hospitals are not ready üó£üó£ WE ARE NOT READY. Because we can‚Äôt be. We can‚Äôt magically generate more PPE. There are a finite number of negative pressure rooms. We can‚Äôt stop the spread on our own. So for the love of God, #STAYHOME #COVID19
Sorry I haven't been on Twitter, much... Struggling with a minor bout of depression.  Probably because my meds ran out at weird intervals, and going outside is dangerous for people like me. *sigh*		(I get nervous every time I think I have a sore throat...üò£)	#COVID19 #coronavirus
CDC states nearly 40% of the #coronavirus cases are people aged 20 to 54.		#StopTheSpread 	#SocialDistancing 	#SocialDistancingNow 	#ThinkOfOthers	#NotInvincible
So, the virus can stay on the surface for days? Wow, we are in big trouble. Shame! #CoronaVirus #COVID19
I was told not to come to work for 7 days because I‚Äôve been in close contact with a coworker who has tested positive for #COVID19 . 		Tishman Speyer is the worst company I‚Äôve ever worked for. As of this time, #RockefellerCenter buildings are open, and I do not know why.
Stop testing asymptomatic NBA players. You want to test so bad, donate that money and tests to the people who really need it! We have symptomatic patients that can't get tested unless they're critically ill and for my population that's too late.	#NBA #CoronavirusOutbreak
Despite the setbacks, I still have faith in my country. Lets support any efforts taken to fight this virus and to bring goodness to the people during this very challenging time.	#covid19 #coronavirus #VirusCoronaIndonesia
Practice  social responsibility or perish. As simple as that. #coronavirus #WuhanVirus
It‚Äôs oddly comforting seeing people wearing masks, gloves, and keeping their distance while out and about. So great seeing people stick together by not sticking together! Best way to get through this #covid19 crisis! #FlattenTheCurve
Stop confusing Millennials and Generation Z. I am a millennial. Gen Z is still traveling and putting people at risk of #COVID19
Regardless of if commencement is canceled, I won‚Äôt be walking. I had every intention to, but #COVID19 put into perspective not only the cost to one‚Äôs health but also the cost to walk across a stage for a piece of paper &amp; a photo. That one moment doesn‚Äôt negate the work I put in.
Call your elderly parents, grandparents, and other lonely elders. If #COVID19       #Covid_19 does not kill them, #SocialDistanacing the isolation and loneliness will.

I couldn‚Äôt brain how some people can lied about being contacted with a positive #COVID19 just to live like a normal people and spreading the virus to the others. How could you be so heartless and selfish? At this tough time, it reveals how truly Malaysians are, disappointing!
Per the state mandate: Schuham will be closed until it is safe to resume business. Be safe and be well. #COVID19 #business
Of the many concerns of #Coronavirus, livelihood deprivation of daily wage earners is a serious one. Starvation can ignite civil unrest &amp; deaths. Providing at least daily nourishment to them is the responsibility of the community. Let‚Äôs stand together &amp; beat the virus. - Sg
Trying to stay level headed. Focusing on the good. Avoiding people, but keeping contact. This too will pass. 	#coronavirus #anxiety
To the healthcare professionals, 		A big bow down to all. You are the heros we didn‚Äôt know we deserved. Thank you for keeping this world together, alive and well in this gruesome times. 	#COVID19 #HealthcareHeroes
Here's something: Don't ask how I know this, but whatever test for #Coronavirus a certain regional hospital network in Pennsylvania is using takes SEVEN DAYS to produce a result. That, to me, seems way too long. #CoronaCrisis
So overwhelmed, so anxious, how many ppl do I worry about. How many ppl do I stop from being wreckless. It‚Äôs mentally draining living like this.  #CoronaVirusUpdate #CoronaInPakistan #CoronavirusPandemic
Please help each other and prioritize the well-being of your healthcare workers. They are our capeless heroes. 		For those who tried to warn us, thank you. We send our prayers to you as we pray for our country too.		#Covid_19
My mum who was diagnosed with cancer 2 wks ago has just had her pre op cancelled due to lack of staff. This will likely happen 2 many others too. So please think about these lives being put at risk also #Covid_19 #StayAtHome #SocialDistanacing #cancer #coronavirus #nhs
It‚Äôs the End of the World as WE KNOW IT! It‚Äôs weird to think that when all this is over so much will have changed. #Covid_19 üôèüèªfor everyone affected by #coronavirus those who have lost their battle to it, those still fighting it and those who still have the fight to come.
A big shout out to the amazing staff on critical care at NGH who are preparing for COVID_19.  For those who are coming back to help thank you. We will be tested but I know that together we are stronger.And remember that not all super heros wear capes.#coronavirus #lisaswan
Good morning. I will be documenting my trip to brickell station. I want to see how crowded the busses are going to be during the rush hour time. Since today is the first day of the cuts to frequency of all #MDT. Hopefully I can still practice "social distance" #coronavirus
Tired of hearing about all these celebrities and sports figures getting tested without symptoms. Let me hear about the regular people getting tested without symptoms #CoronavirusPandemic
Be a responsible citizen in the time of crisis. #StayTheFuckHome #COVID19
The key workers list - what about hotel staff housing NHS workers and people self isolating? Surely they should be on the key workers list too? #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #coronavirus
"Why the hell do they need fucking special treatment, they're gonna be dead soon anyway"!! üò≤üò†		And that, dear reader, is not only one of the most disgusting things I've ever heard, but an indication of so much that is wrong with society these days! üôÅ		#Covid_19	#CoronaCrisis
Every American should have access to testing NOW #COVID19
If all bars, clubs, gyms etc are closing why are clothes shops and other none essential shops still open! You‚Äôre telling me shops like Primark that are very busy shops that people do go to socialise are okay!!!??? Close all shops except supermarkets and essentials! #COVID19

Why is there an international glove shortage? Because people like the gas attendants wear gloves and change them with each customer. Unless you are a health care professional or first responder you do NOT need gloves. Wash your hands and let us have the supplies we need. #covid19
As things continue to ramp up w/#COVID19, keep supporting each other. 		Shoot a text to someone you know who is on the frontlines to check in on them and show your support.		It may seem like a small deal, but may be just what that person needs! 		We will get through this together
Soooo why doesn‚Äôt law enforcement just clear the beaches?#Covid_19

So #COVID19 could have broader symptoms and more long term impact than is currently expected. Medical teams working on this disease would benefit from collaborating with veterinarians who have been studying coronaviruses for decades. 2/2
I really never thought I‚Äôd see the day where my job, my health, my life, my families lives, my friends lives, were all threatened by something like this. I‚Äôm calling this WWIII. But this time we‚Äôre all at war with the same enemy. #CoronaCrisis #COVID19 #SocialDistancing #wwiii
I just started thinking about the reality of this virus spreading throughout Central America. So many people are going to lose their jobs. So many people are going to die. My heart is breaking. #coronavirus
So are we all just going to ignore the fact that kids and families are still packed in cages under horrible conditions? #coronavirus #COVID19 #SocialDistanacing #Immigration #ReleaseThemNow
#CoronaVirusPakistan	#CoronaVirusUpdate 		Alhamdulillah, I see no panic on the streets of #Pakistan in fear of #CoronaVirus 		The only reason is that this nation have seen the worse face of suicide bombing &amp; target killings.		It has became too resilient to fight with this as well
What‚Äôs gonna happen to my requirement to report for jury duty with all the #coronavirus stuff happening? They aren‚Äôt actually having us all gather in the courthouse are they?
Things we're learning:		‚Ä¢ who's really an essential employee	‚Ä¢ how to cherish our elderly	‚Ä¢ flex work is possible	‚Ä¢ we are more alike than we thought	‚Ä¢ basic hygiene		#coronavirus
When this is all over can we have massive parties in our local towns/ villages/cities for all of the key workers getting us through this crisis?		Make it a bank holiday and have a proper thank you to everyone?		#COVID19
Guys, he already apologised for his mistake and I guess it's better for me to take down this tweet. Anyway, let this be a lesson for all to not take any opportunity for what is happening right now. I hope everyone is aware with the current situation. Stay safe! #COVID19

I work behind the scenes for a large healthcare facility. I am in a non clinic based office w/cubicles that sit 20+ employees about 3ft apart. We are not being prepped to work from home. We provide our own sanitizers &amp;wipes. But hey, we get temp check tents on Monday. #COVID19 ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
