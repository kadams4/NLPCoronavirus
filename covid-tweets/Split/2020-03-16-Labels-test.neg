Hear me out- werenâ€™t people dying from a mysterious vaping disease a few months ago that affected the lungs? Is that still a thing too? #coronavirus
If this shit lasts till July or August Iâ€™m going to flip my shit!!!!!! My husband needs to come back from deployment and these kids need to be in school! #coronavirus
Some potential #coronavirus stats;	First of all the predicted #Infection rates have been wildly estimated at anything between 1% - 80% of the total population. And the current #mortality rate of 'closed' cases sits at 8% (granted, this doesn't include non-reported cases)...
how have they cancelled my work experience and sent all of us kids back to school because of the coronavirus, isnâ€™t  that a bit stupid iâ€™m pretty sure iâ€™m more likely to get the virus in school than at work experienceðŸ˜¡ #Covid19Walkout #coronavirus
