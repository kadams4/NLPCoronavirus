Folks....it‚Äôs very simple why the media and left won‚Äôt give Trump any credit. They can‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt want to lose an election in November. Their hate of the President is more important than the citizens of the USA. #COVID19

Before anyone sees the News or reads Tweets about the number of #COVID19 cases in America. Italy has a Population of about 61 Million and the US has a Population of about 327 Million. So Yes the MORE people get tested, the MORE cases we‚Äôll have. Don‚Äôt be alarmed, be aware üñ§

#diaryofalockdownkid(woman) Day 4.... done nowt again... #COVID19 #CoronaLockdown
Not to sound insensitive to sick/dead due to #COVID19 but if there is a silver lining, it would be that we might see less hospitalizations and deaths due to seasonal flu as we are all quarantined and keeping our public and private spaces 100x cleaner from ü¶†
not even gonna bother looking at the symptoms of #COVID19 cos al just self diagnose me self
2. US will cross million cases within 1-2 weeks, most likely they will go untested for a while. No health system can contain or test 1 million people in a day or a week.		By the time the 1M being tested, God knows how many more might be infected. #COVID2019 #coronavirus

Through reading and talking to fellow healers, I have come to understand that the initial symptoms of #COVID19 is the loss of sense of smell and taste.	Avoid mucus formation foods, keep your bowels clear, take deep breaths, stay safe and keep others safe.
Can all the travel sites/agencies, please stop sending emails for new deals? We can't go anywhere. #COVID19

For 108 years we have criticized the Titanic for not having enough life boat space for all passengers. 	However we, in 2020, live in a country with only 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 citizens.  	Side note: 31 other countries come ahead of us in beds per 1000  citizens. #COVID19

The thing dangerous than #COVID19 is the incompetent people at the top post of Government and equally all these deluded irresponsible citizens.
Both Boris Johnson &amp; Donald Trump changed their strategy midway through the pandemic &amp; embraced actions experts had recommended for months.Those early failures were a proximate cause of the deaths of many. If this were a company we might be looking at criminal charges.#Covid_19
