My boyfriend was due to start a new job on Monday and so he quit his current one. They have now told him that they are letting him go because of coronavirus so now he is unemployed and has no idea where or when he will get work #coronavirus
So besides the corona virus what is everyone up to?	#coronavirus #SundayFunday
the #coronavirus because we are a praying n God fearing nation, and the Lord granted their request Amen
Incase of a lockdown Kenyans will die because of hunger than #COVID19  we live hand to mouth the only thing that the government should have done is to ensure that it doesn't get here   #StayHome #CoronaVirusUpdates
They are a group of 57 countries and they don't even have a F first aid kit for #corona and what they claim is "Hmare Purvajon ne Taj Mahal banwaya, L lehsun bnaya 🙏	#COVID19india 	#CoronaVirusUpdates 	#CoronavirusOutbreak
It is utterly insane that a govt with a history of lying says we are to trust the science and then  declines to offer the evidence base for those scientific decisions. Even though the outcome of all scientific reasoning is obtained through peer scrutiny. #UKGoverment #COVID19
As the daughter of a man who makes cleaning and disinfectant products for a living, #coronavirus has actually been fairy positive for us
People are running around buying up TP and hand sanitizer and I just want to snatch up my favorite foods at my favorite restaurants before they shut down. #coronavirus

This morning, I read that the cause of the Covid-19 outbreak is thought to have originated possibly from illegal sales of pangolin, a scaly anteater which is prized in China for its use in traditional medicine. How ridiculously ironic. 😡 #COVID19 #coronavirus #coronavirusuk
Hi friends! It’s Lotus from Chicago and I work in healthcare with amazing people who are showing up everyday to care for you and those with #COVID19! Big shout to them! #COVID19Special #hrsocialhour
A couple thoughts on screenings:	1. While in Italy I was not concerned about #COVID19. I was concerned when we got on the plane and had no room to move. I went to the restroom after some lady that was coughing and had to use my elbows to operate everything (not that it helps).
truly sad I can’t work. Temp 38, all consuming myalgia+++ = my personal worst symptom, general migrainous headache, dry cough &amp; sore throat since yesterday but no major respiratory symptoms. Good news appear to be 3-5 days behind parents who are improving🤞#covid19 #selfisolating
CNN is reporting the Federal Reserve is slashing interest rates to zero. #CoronaVirusUpdates #CoronaVirusUpdates #coronavirus #coronavirusLosAngele

We need a third remake of We Are the World right now #coronavirus
Hey teachers, please consider a collection for a donation to your custodians when you get back to school. 		They aren't getting time off. They are going to work every day to make it safe for us to go back. 		#COVIDー19 	#schoolclosures	#StayHome 	#coronavirus
Can Pence stop bragging about the "unprecedented public/private partnerships!" that are carrying out the testing. Yeah we know, companies are going to make a shitload of taxpayer money due to this virus. Great job assholes	#COVIDー19 #coronavirus
Thanos must be sitting somewhere and smiling now #coronavirus #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdates #coronavirusindia
I feel like I should start a thread of ideas for people stuck in quarantine. Maybe include some links for free trials of things like Audible, Crunchyroll, etc. Anyone want to help? #Quarantine #COVID19

When I’m 500 lbs I blame #coronavirus because when I’m sitting at home, all I wanna do is eat snacks....
So we can’t even buy waakye right? #Covid19
This world is starting to become apocalyptic, its so scary. Our generation may not live for much longer. The affects it will have on everything are unthinkable. The Government have no plan of action #coronavirus
Can people, like, not spit on the street/in public? Is there some weird, involuntary reflex I’m not aware of??	#COVID19
Got to show #14 how to make an omelet this morning and this is the kind of stuff I'm cherishing with all of this #coronavirus

Never thought I would see the day where I’m asking myself what I will do with a Saturday not physio’n at the football 😂 #coronavirus
Trying to protect Boomer relatives from #COVID19 is like trying to help an injured animal: You're in constant danger of being attacked because they don't understand that you're just trying to help them...
Term of the decade: #COVID19
The Dutch have closed their sex shops. 	This is really starting to hit home now.	#coronavirus
I think it’s odd that the people who are not at all happy with the government’s response to the #CoronavirusOutbreak  want the same government in charge of our healthcare all the time. #BernieSanders  #Biden2020
Netflix and Covid-19 social distancing. 		#COVIDー19 	#CoronavirusPandemic 	#CloseTheSchools 	#CloseThePubs
I’m seeing a lot of academics on #ScienceTwitter retweeting accounts that spread Chinese propaganda. We need to be careful, remember that half the reason the world is infected is because one brave soul revealed a virus that the chinese government was trying to hide. #coronavirus
Used my first day of actively trying to stay in, to tidy my bedroom. If this continues for months I might actually be one of those people with a tidy home 😮 #coronavirus #selfisolate
Black Friday Shopping prepared me for shopping trips like today #covid19 #strategicshopper
It amazes me that gross ass adults dont have a "emergency fund" or a little bit of money to fall back on just in case they get laid off, hurt, or #COVID19 happens.
