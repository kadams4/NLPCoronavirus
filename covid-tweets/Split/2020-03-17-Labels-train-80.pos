We have decide to limit my daughters exposure to myself and the potential exposure to the virus.  	After I had a patient cough in my face (accidentally) as I helped her to the car it got me to thinking. 	We aren‚Äôt screening patients as they enter our building.  		#coronavirus
I‚Äôm glad the fed gov‚Äôt is working on a stimulus, but workers who are laid off and ineligible for unemployment are going to need more than $1,000 to weather this. We are talking months here, not weeks. #COVID19 #coronavirus
First time my former Gov is making sense. I hope it is not rhetoric, I pray he sticks with this new path of all loving and accepting he is human n  make mistakes too. Nigeria need everyone to be focused now and fight our common enemies #Poverty #insurgency #CoronavirusOutbreak
Spare a thought for all the poor hospital infection coordinators! Tough job in a tough time.	#FlattenTheCurve #coronavirus
In these times of crisis, let's just take care of each other. Let's be responsible people #coronavirus #QuedateEnLaCasa  #stayhomechallenge
Working from home for this week at least. Our very sensible company is phasing us out of the office to reduce risks to ours and others‚Äô health. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª #HomeOffice #KeepingSafe #COVID19
Trying as a self employed person who now looks like is out of work till June at least to stay strong,  hoping things will get better.. It can't rain forever! #COVID19 #COVID„Éº19 #COVID19ireland #weddings #SmallBusinesses
NOW would be a GREAT time to support local businesses. As a small business owner, what is happening with the #Coronavirus greatly impacts my family and many other local families.
I feel like the United States' response to this pandemic was: plugging its ears, closing its eyes, and yelling "lalalala". And then this week, the United States finally opened its eyes and was like "shoot, that usually works. There goes plan A, B, and C!" #coronavirus #COVID19
First of all, we need to stop putting a time line on this virus as if someone is controlling it. YOU CAN RECOVER FASTER if you stay home and and STOP SPREADING IT. I understand the struggle, we all have bills and have to eat. STOP PANICKING #COVID19 #coronapocolypse

TO THE PEOPLE OF #WESTVIRGINIA your #REPRESENTATIVES ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH THROUGHOUT THIS STATE TO HELP PREVENT THE SPREAD OF #COVID19!! SO IF YOU ARE SICK WITH AN UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION PLZ TRY TO GET TESTED FOR THE #coronavirus  IN FACT DEMAND IT!THEY'RE NOT TESTING ENOUGH
Wash your hands, stay safe everyone. #COVID19
Just listened to doctors and nurses outside my exam room talk about how they were running out of places to eat due to the high volume of food service workers they had to deny #coronavirus testing to against their better judgement because they weren‚Äôt likely to die.
An important factor with the #coronavirus  pandemic is Time. How long before the majority of the population gets infected? How long before there is a vaccine or cure? How long before it #mutates to a deadlier strain? How long will we be In isolation?
someone should set up a pay it forward scheme so we can look after the elderly. #COVID19
Doctors and the whole medical staff are heroes ‚ù§Ô∏è	#coronavirus 	#CoronavirusOutbreak
This #CoronavirusPandemic is getting out of control! Every place is closed! Libraries, banks, Restraunts you name it.
final thoughts for today on #coronavirus is assume it‚Äôs on everything and that everyone has it. It‚Äôs almost impossible to not touch stuff between hand hygiene and eating as an example. Maintain 2 metres between everyone and stop being self conscious about reminding people as much
We need to unite as one species NOW to defeat this #pandemic, so we can get back to global warming! It‚Äôs cold out!		#COVID„Éº19  #coronavirus #GlobalWarming
We have the right conditions for this thing to spiral out of control real quick, I wish our leadership had made this decision earlier #Coronavirussouthafrica #Covid_19

All it takes is for one teacher or student to have #coronavirus and they don‚Äôt need to be a #superspreader but my guess is it would be super spreading in a school!

Living with someone who goes on with things same as usual with #COVID19. Doesn't get what that means for me if I'm infected. I'm all anger and sadness right now. So much sadness. Bad enough most of the symptoms are similar to what I already live with. #chronicillness #fibro

Coronavirus cases in Turkey increase exponentially like Italy. Measures taken by Turkish government are very serious but not enough. Many people working in private sector are still going to work. And these people are under risk. #coronavirus #ciddiyealƒ±n
