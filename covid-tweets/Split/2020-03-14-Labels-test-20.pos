well, boris johnson, look where not closing the schools has gotten us so far....	800 cases at 2pm yesterday....	....	1100 cases less than 24 hours later.	Congratulations!	That’s a 300 case rise in less than 24 hours.	And THAT is a 37.5% rise nationally.	#coronaUK #coronavirus
#Iran reports 1,365 new cases of #coronavirus and 97 new deaths, raising total to 12,729 cases and 611 deaths
Gas prices going down is not a good thing, guys... hundreds, if not thousands, of oil field families are losing their jobs and subsequently their livelihood. This #Covid_19 virus isn’t just effecting folks through contracting illness. Worldwide spread panic is also a virus.
Don’t make patients pay for virus tests and treatment. People with lower incomes will be deterred from seeking treatment if they face health care costs, worsening the epidemic. #COVID19
Okay UK, the #Covid19 #coronavirus infection rates are going up and it’s getting widespread amongst the population. If you haven’t already it’s time to #ISOLATEtheELDERLY Get anyone older or frail to isolate now whilst it spreads through the young and healthy #herdimmunity
Just returned from a grocery store in #Philadelphia . Most stuff is available except toilet paper. Don't do #panicbuying and we'll all be fine from the #coronapocalypse #COVID19
Everyone needs to understand the basic principles of public health, particularly that health is social. #COVID19 is showing that we have a long way to go on this front. This is so important that basic public health needs to be incorporated into every high school curriculum.
Why You need government to isolate regular life and activities??		Don't be stupid. ... 	Isolate yourself , Think before you go out, or meet people.. be a responsible family member, Stay safe and take care of your love once. 	#coronavirus #COVID19
Dear Everone. Wash your hands, stay calm and stay healthy. Act, don't overreact. #Covid_19 is something to take serious, but if we can work together and share our soaps and hand sanitizers (and apparently T.P) then the mortality rate will remain 2 per 100,000 #COVID19 #Facts
Trying to figure out this social distancing thing while teaching and working in high school. #coronavirus
To all my friends in #healthcare both personally and professionally,  thank you for all you do, especially in times like this. Humanity is blessed to have you. ##EPeeps #IE #HealthCareWorkers #COVID19
Switzerland has twice as many cases per capita than China. Why are we still reporting absolute numbers? Surprised to see Switzerland not making enough news compared to other EU counties. #Switzerland #coronavirus
