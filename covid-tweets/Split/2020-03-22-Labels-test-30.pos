Absolutely disgusted with the 2 companies I work for, remaining open when they are non-essential, no care for the #NHS no care for its staff or anyone else! Pure greed and selfishness!! I'm embarrassed to even have to open my store.! #CoronaCrisis #Covid_19 #nhs
I hate COVID-19, but what I hate more is the Zombie Apocalypse of Stupidity that it has caused. 		I have dealt with 100 Karens who think that the rules don‚Äôt apply to them for one reason or another. #callcenterproblems #Covid_19
I want to give a shout out to all those risking their lives to continue to serve! BUT TO THE OWNERS:  it is shameful that you not giving your employees hazard pay! #Sheetz #Walmart #Covid_19
It really frustrates me that people are taking COVID-19 so lightly. Some of us have family members who are immunocompromised &amp; can die if exposed. Shit idk if you heard but 34 year olds are dying from this virus. #QuaratineLife #CoronavirusPandemic #StayAtHome #Covid_19
It took a lot of effort for people to stop  assuming a person was HIV negative because of how healthy they looked. Believing that anyone (including yourself) can contract a virus is the 1st towards effective prevention. #Covid_19
If I ask you, would you prefer 	a) Temporary freedom 	b) Survival	What would be your answer? 	If it‚Äôs option (b), then you must do what the situation demands and the Govt commands	#CoronaVirusPakistan #lockdownpakistan #CoronavirusPandemic 	#CoronaVirusUpdate
#CoronavirusPandemic The part that is gut wrenching is that some people who tested positive didn‚Äôt have any symptoms üò≥ BUT the White House is telling us that everyone don‚Äôt need to be tested ü§¨ Pretty much telling us to just walk around and die having no explanation
Stay at home. Be safe ..	Corana verious end soon	#Covid_19
If you know someone who has come back from abroad recently, ask whether they've been tested for #coronavirus #Covid_19 whenever they come in contact with you.		DEMAND PROOF!!!		It is your right to stay safe.		#India
Here‚Äôs a tip if you insist on going to a supermarket and queuing up. Place the length of the trolley between you and the person in front of you. That‚Äôs a nice distance so you at least put yourself at least risk. #SocialDistance #Covid_19
P A N D E M I C		The world is in danger,	But not because of anger.	A virus that can kill thousands,	COVID19, everyone.		I know this is a disease,	That can be a crisis.	But we have this day heroes,	They called it frontliners.		#COVID19 #WorldPoetryDay2020
Don't know why people are hesitating to get consulted by the doctor. If somebody feels that he/she is n't fine or have any symptoms of corona virus. They must consult with required authorities. Why running away and making others life difficult?	#CoronavirusPandemic	#KanikaKapoor
Day 5: not so cool - my 4 yo came down with a fever :( normally this would be status quo...but #COVID19 changes all that ü•∫
Ur grandparents got called into war.	U were called to sit on ur couch.	U can do this. 	#Coronavirus	#QuaratineAndChill	#Californialockdown
Plz take #CoronaVirus serious &amp; stay at home üôèüèª For the sake of ur family atleast.Minimize ur Social activities.Stay safe &amp; let people be safe..! You may seem Corona as a Joke until u become a victim of it.		#ChineseWuhanViru #CoronaStopKaroNa #WarAgainstVirus #SocialDistanacing
Stay at home plzzüôè		#CoronaVirus
I was shown a picture of Victoria Park in East London today and it looked like there was some kind of festival happening there were so many people out. Ppl aren't taking this seriously and the death toll is going to skyrocket because of it. #Covid_19
Took my 4 yr old for a walk yesterday. We walked by 3 parks but told him that he couldn't play with the other kids because of #COVID19. Perhaps all of Canada should close playgrounds for now. Social distancing ?Saw way too many groups of kids "socializing". Everyone, do your part
Respective state authorities, please seal state borders for 14 days to arrest the transmission of virus inside and outside. Restrict public movement in the interest of public health. Do not allow gathering of more than 5-6 people at a place. üôèüèª		#CoronavirusPandemic	#Covid19India
