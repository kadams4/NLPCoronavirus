Your delivery people remember you and may even remember where you live? Think twice before you skip the #Tips. We *do* flag bad customers and refuse orders from them in the future. Plus- if you skip tips during #CoVid19 you suck and shouldnâ€™t be ordering #delivery.
Once this is over the, the super rich are going to be super duper rich. #COVID19
The concept of literally toxic people bothers me #coronavirus
So #COVID19 is not completely ruled out for me. Pneumonia is getting no better in current antibiotics. What does this mean for me. 		More meds and back into full blown quarantine again. 		Someone kill me please.
I only think it's fair that if you survive #COVID19 that you should be imbued with the powers of a bat or pangolin
It's REALLY bothering me how folks are using #covid19 as an opportunity to completely DESTROY an entire group of people just because they belong to a certain political party. This goes for both sides of the aisle.		STOP IT.	PEOPLE ARE SICK, DYING, &amp; SUFFERING.  	WE CAN DO BETTER.
During coronavirus: toilet paper and hand sanitizer out of stock. 		After coronavirus: alcohol and condoms out of stock.     #coronavirus
I just ordered ice cream on uber eats. Iâ€™m trying to figure out if itâ€™s a new high or new low ðŸ¤”#coronavirus #CoronaLockdown
