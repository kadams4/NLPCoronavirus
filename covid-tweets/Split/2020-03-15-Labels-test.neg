I refuse to let anyone make me feel bad for not panicking and freaking out about #coronavirus.		I can be alert and sensible without acting like it's the end of the world or that '10x more deadly than flu' is anything other than 'not really that deadly', thanks.
Apparently West Virginians are immune to the #coronavirus. Must be in their genes.
Be prepared for the unexpected #COVID19
Anyone to blame for this #COVIDãƒ¼19 spread is China. Hiding this for 2 months and keeping doctors quiet to alert others to prepare and close borders faster. #coronavirus
