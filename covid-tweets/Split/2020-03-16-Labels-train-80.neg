Are we being quarantined to our homes so that the #Census2020 can get better results? 🤔 I’m onto you federal government. #COVID19
More than #coronavirus i am now scared about the economy. Then entire country is shutting down for a month.. What wil be the case after that.. #CoronavirusOutbreak

Hear me out- weren’t people dying from a mysterious vaping disease a few months ago that affected the lungs? Is that still a thing too? #coronavirus
I don’t think a Military curfew or Marshal law will be needed for this virus/ pandemic. I’m just glad we aren’t dealing with a Airborne Ebola. #WorkFromHome #COVIDー19 #StayHomeSaveLives #CoronavirusOutbreak
In all this mess I think we can all agree that ‘The Corona Isolation Imperative’ is a f*cking phenomenal band name. #coronapocolypse #covidー19 #coronavirus
All these celebrities endlessly plugging their new song/album. Ffs. Pop out that bubble and get a grip! #CoronavirusOutbreak
Breaking : Govt to demolish all the hospitals in the country and build statues instead to tackle Corona virus situation. Work on war footing.		#Corona #CoronavirusOutbreak #statue
Magnitude of idiocy is directly proportional to amplitude of outbreak.	#coronavirus
Only good thing to come out of #coronavirus is I don't get #GretaThunberg popping into my feed all the time!
Are there names for the people outside of celebrities who have #COVID19. So far I have seen not a one. Why aren’t these people blowing up on social media sharing their stories as the virus runs its course? Happens with everything else....
As football fans, we endured one of the most boring weekend ever of a football season all thanks to #COVID19 . 😥

Don’t hear much from #antivaxx headcases these days, do you? 		#Covid19
Some potential #coronavirus stats;	First of all the predicted #Infection rates have been wildly estimated at anything between 1% - 80% of the total population. And the current #mortality rate of 'closed' cases sits at 8% (granted, this doesn't include non-reported cases)...
