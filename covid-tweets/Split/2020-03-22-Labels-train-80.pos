I work in a GP practice, I need to be at work...please follow social distancing when you‚Äôre outside #CoronavirusPandemic üôè
If you are addicted to vaping/smoking I strongly suggest you stop. #coronavirus #ImmuneSystem
People out there complaining about working from home and I am stuck at workplace for 2 weeks, can't even go home because some stupidfucks decided the best time to organize an International Conference was during COVID19!!	#AcademicChatter #CoronavirusPandemic 	#SaturdayThoughts
Self isolation and social distancing are the ultimate weapons in this fight against #Covid19. On March 22nd, let us do our bit to make #JanataCurfew successful. Stay home. Stay safe. That is the least we can do.
Just had to postpone my #henparty I know it‚Äôs nothing compared to what people in the world are going through but I‚Äôm gutted üò´please god let this #Covid_19 go away!! Stay indoors people the sooner we do it will stop!! #StayAtHome
If you love your family then STAY AT HOME for their sake, please don't become a threat to your own family. #IndiaFightsCorona #CoronaStopKaroNa #CoronavirusOutbreakindia #COVID19 #mumbailockdown #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus
Most of the #Covid_19 cases in India coming because people coming from abroad, advised to home quarantine, are not following advises. They are doing traveling, joining mass gathering and spreading the #Covid_19 virus all over.
Now that the EM match is done... Graduate the students early. Hospitals could use the help. 	#COVID19
Let‚Äôs put this into perspective:		AS OF TODAY:		13 deaths in Canada. 		1099 cases in Canada		Ontario has 377 cases, up 59		7279 awaiting results In Ontario 		If that‚Äôs not a wake up call I‚Äôm not sure what else will provoke you to #STAYATHOME #covid19 #onpoli
There‚Äôs a BIG difference between a treatment and a vaccine. Make no mistake. Only when there‚Äôs widespread vaccination will this thing start disappearing from society... #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus
I will abide by the #JanataCurfew on 22nd March 2020 (Tomorrow) and extend my full support to the government in breaking the chain of #CoronaVirus. We must consider it as social responsibility and refrain ourselves from going out. #JanataCurfewChallenge
I want to give a shout out to all those risking their lives to continue to serve! BUT TO THE OWNERS:  it is shameful that you not giving your employees hazard pay! #Sheetz #Walmart #Covid_19
I balled my eyes out as we drove away. This is so depressing. üò≠ #lovemygrannyandgramps #6ftaway #CoronavirusPandemic
I hate COVID-19, but what I hate more is the Zombie Apocalypse of Stupidity that it has caused. 		I have dealt with 100 Karens who think that the rules don‚Äôt apply to them for one reason or another. #callcenterproblems #Covid_19
With so much to look back at ‚ù§Ô∏èThis too shall pass , just stay safe and smart ! Keep üßº üñêüèº ‚ù§Ô∏è #CoronavirusPandemic #SocialDistanacing
Now you know how hard being medical care huh? .. To be frank, #KKM had a lots of cases yang degil mcm #Patient136  Stop blaming him, you come back to ward, and let us help, you don‚Äôt want to think about other people, okay, help yourself you still positive for #Covid_19 .. please.
Just had a conversation with my husband about moving out because of the steady increase In positive #COVID19 cases. I don‚Äôt want to do this, But I gotta do what is right for my family. What are other RN‚Äôs out there doing to keep their family safe? I am an ICURN on a corona unit.
If you want to know true fear, wake with a cough and phlegm in your throat, and have to wait on testing. #CoronavirusPandemic
We thank medical practioners for their great work done, they ain't the last line of defense they are in the front lines, and for all those in the labs looking for a way forward, after God you are the last defense of the common man, May God strengthen you all. #Covid_19 #StayHome
If you show any symptoms make sure to call the hotlines made available and stay at home.I know we will soon beat #Covid19 as a team and community. Say a word of prayer for everyone and the world as a whole(Isaiah 46-4).
This is how a country flattens the curve. Pay them to stay home! #Covid_19 #StayAtHome
I‚Äôm worried if things get worse with #Covid_19 I‚Äôm on crutches atm and everything‚Äôs a struggle, I can‚Äôt go to the shops and do a food shop. But also it‚Äôs just going to get harder to get into the doctors atm! I don‚Äôt have a major injury but still!
Pls take #Covid_19 seriously. Today we say people walking around like normal on my high street. Shops open as normal?? Is 5000 cases not even to open our eyes? #StayAtHome #CoronaCrisisuk #CoronavirusPandemic
It took a lot of effort for people to stop  assuming a person was HIV negative because of how healthy they looked. Believing that anyone (including yourself) can contract a virus is the 1st towards effective prevention. #Covid_19
When all this is over I hope y'all still stay cautious cause it's not gonna be 100% gone for a hot minute. It's gonna take months for things to go completely back to normal 		#CoronavirusPandemic  #COVID„Éº19 #QuaratineLife #coronavirus
It is extremely important to #StayAtHome, as much as is humanely possible. It could make a great deal of difference, particularly to the most vulnerable. If necessary to save lives, governments worldwide should introduce more stringent restrictions of movement. 	#Covid_19
And the total tally of #covid infected passes the 300,000 mark globally. It seems, humanity is in deep deep danger. Until we stop the chain this will keep in increasing. Stay safe and maintain social distancing...	#CoronavirusPandemic 	#coronavirus 	#IndiaFightsCorona
You need to take a week off if you have a wee cough. Stay home and keep yourself and other safe. #coronavirus

Just think. It won't be our government who put us in total lockdown. It'll be the brainless idiots who ignore their advice who put us in lockdown. Get a grip morons!! #justSaying #StayHomeSaveLives #Covid_19
It is clearly the right thing for public health, but I never thought I would live to see the day that required keeping six feet away from all my fellow humans. #Covid_19 üòî

If I ask you, would you prefer 	a) Temporary freedom 	b) Survival	What would be your answer? 	If it‚Äôs option (b), then you must do what the situation demands and the Govt commands	#CoronaVirusPakistan #lockdownpakistan #CoronavirusPandemic 	#CoronaVirusUpdate
I was in Morrison's yesterday morning, some woman coughed on me; I'll be dead soon, #CoronaCrisis, #CoronaVirus üòÅ
Really saddened by the #Covid_19 tragedy in #Italy. Unfortunately part of the problem is the endemic ignorance and acceptance of mediocrity which affects the country bar some heights of excellence like the heroes fighting in our hospitals. I hope this will be a wake up call.
But let's not lose heart. It can be slowed down. Stay in your homes, wash your hands regularly, call 1075 in case symptoms surface (coz state helplines most probably won't work) and don't hoard essential commodities		Doctors, Nurses and healthcare ppl need them more #Covid_19
#CoronavirusPandemic The part that is gut wrenching is that some people who tested positive didn‚Äôt have any symptoms üò≥ BUT the White House is telling us that everyone don‚Äôt need to be tested ü§¨ Pretty much telling us to just walk around and die having no explanation
Everyone STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM PEOPLE. STAY INSIDE OR 6 FT FROM PEOPLE!! Don‚Äôt know why that‚Äôs so fuckin hard. Ask your introverted friends. They can help you and tell you how to keep occupied at this time. Or you can ask me, I‚Äôll help you. #covid19 #coronavirus
Corona has proven that India's biggest problem is not illiteracy , it is stupidity of literate people. 	#CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaChainScare #CoronavirusOutbreakindia 	#StaySafeStayHome
I hate morning where my sleep was irregular and leave me with a terrible headache. Any type of physical issue is having me paranoid. Symptoms don‚Äôt match #COVID19 though. So I‚Äôm not too worried.		For now...
Anyone else incessantly taking their temperature?? üò´ #Covid_19 #SocialDistancing
I‚Äôve been pretty quiet on here recently, dealing with the #Covid_19 stress and leaving school. Remember to practise social distancing, follow the government advice and also practise a bit of self-care. It‚Äôs a tough time for everyone ‚ù§Ô∏è
Home safe home!	#StayAtHome 	#Covid_19 	#CoronaCrisis

If Jumuah in congregation was cancelled and you're not socially distancing yourself you better check yourself. #COVID19
Don't you think you can't get infected with corona hence you are free to roam around. Don't take it lightly. Stay at home. 		#Covid_19

I was shown a picture of Victoria Park in East London today and it looked like there was some kind of festival happening there were so many people out. Ppl aren't taking this seriously and the death toll is going to skyrocket because of it. #Covid_19
The variable in this equation isn't abstract; it's human lives. If our leadership acts swiftly we can PREVENT damage. Public health officials ought to know that prevention is always the best medicine. #CoronavirusUSA #ShelterInPlaceNow #CDCwonttestme #CoronaCrisis #Covid_19

Isn‚Äôt it fascinating how people say that they would die for their country yet they won‚Äôt stay at home for it.	#JustStayAtHome #FlattenTheCuve #CoronavirusPandemic #TrumpLiesPeopleDie
Damn, I get fucking alpha packs at 10% and you mean to tell me the death rate for covid-19 is 10%? Must stay away at all costs..... #coronavirus

In awe of medical officials working overtime to fight the battle at the front with every possible skill.	Also in awe of WhatsApp University professors working from home overtime to fight science with every possible lie.	#CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19
Absolutely disgusted with the 2 companies I work for, remaining open when they are non-essential, no care for the #NHS no care for its staff or anyone else! Pure greed and selfishness!! I'm embarrassed to even have to open my store.! #CoronaCrisis #Covid_19 #nhs
With #CoronavirusPandemic fast spreading in #pakistan , people of Pak may start running towards India as refugees as Pakistan is not capable of handling it . Situation may go ther worse than #Italy 	#CoronaCrisis 	#lockdown 	We need to stop #corona fast . #PhysicalDistancing
Biggest spike in Italy is amongst younger patients...now hitting people hard in 40‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs.  I suspect lots of people who may have psychology distanced themselves from #coronavirus due to age may rethink if this does escalate along similar lines in UK.
Stay at home. Be safe ..	Corana verious end soon	#Covid_19
It really frustrates me that people are taking COVID-19 so lightly. Some of us have family members who are immunocompromised &amp; can die if exposed. Shit idk if you heard but 34 year olds are dying from this virus. #QuaratineLife #CoronavirusPandemic #StayAtHome #Covid_19
If there is a ban on the gathering of 5+ people in Delhi, then why are about 4 thousand government personnel, 1 thousand security personnel, 790 MPs + media are allowed to be collected daily in the Parliament House?	#CoronavirusPandemic
Day 5: not so cool - my 4 yo came down with a fever :( normally this would be status quo...but #COVID19 changes all that ü•∫
I just washed my wallet and credit cards and I dont feel that makes me paranoid.	#Covid_19 #CoronavirusPandemic
Please Stay at home  üôè#Coronavirus
If you know someone who has come back from abroad recently, ask whether they've been tested for #coronavirus #Covid_19 whenever they come in contact with you.		DEMAND PROOF!!!		It is your right to stay safe.		#India
Dude, I keep seeing all of these reports of young ppl getting #coronavirus and how scary it is and... I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I‚Äôm scared. Like REALLY scaredüòê
I have to applaud Gen X and Millennials on how they are handling the seriousness of #COVID19.		Now as for Baby Boomers and Gen Z...can‚Äôt say the same for you.
Let's be a part of this great initiative #JanataCurfew and unitedly fight the #COVID19. Stand out on your balconies and clap for all the nation's heroes at 5PM tomorrow.	Be responsible! 	#Stayhome #Staysafe #IndiaFightsCorona
