Living with someone who goes on with things same as usual with #COVID19. Doesn't get what that means for me if I'm infected. I'm all anger and sadness right now. So much sadness. Bad enough most of the symptoms are similar to what I already live with. #chronicillness #fibro

First of all, we need to stop putting a time line on this virus as if someone is controlling it. YOU CAN RECOVER FASTER if you stay home and and STOP SPREADING IT. I understand the struggle, we all have bills and have to eat. STOP PANICKING #COVID19 #coronapocolypse
To everybody's saying that people are recovering from the coronavirus and aren't scared cuz they're 'healthy'. please don't forget the possibility of the virus mutate and if we don't have a vaccination soon. #COVID19 #stayhome

I have developed a dry cough with a bronchial burn.  No other symptoms besides post nasal drip. Should I call the doc or ride it out? I live in a corona hot spot. I don‚Äôt want to go to the doctors if i don‚Äôt have to. #coronavirus
First time my former Gov is making sense. I hope it is not rhetoric, I pray he sticks with this new path of all loving and accepting he is human n  make mistakes too. Nigeria need everyone to be focused now and fight our common enemies #Poverty #insurgency #CoronavirusOutbreak

I‚Äôve been so careful since this #COVID19 thing started and now my son is being tested for it. If you‚Äôre still living your life normally, please don‚Äôt be a fucking moron.
final thoughts for today on #coronavirus is assume it‚Äôs on everything and that everyone has it. It‚Äôs almost impossible to not touch stuff between hand hygiene and eating as an example. Maintain 2 metres between everyone and stop being self conscious about reminding people as much
Be Safe from #coronavirus infection
What is LA doing about all those homeless folks now that we have the #coronavirus outbreak?
Two friends just contracted #coronavirus unknowingly and have to self-quarantine. We took him groceries and left them outside the door. We live in a rural area. Be safe everyone.
We have decide to limit my daughters exposure to myself and the potential exposure to the virus.  	After I had a patient cough in my face (accidentally) as I helped her to the car it got me to thinking. 	We aren‚Äôt screening patients as they enter our building.  		#coronavirus
How can we ease the surge in our medical community? Remove individual state license requirements &amp; adopt reciprocity for all medical personnel in good standing in their home state. military transport to area of greatest need #InItTogether #COVID19
please, reach out to a service industry worker you know and let them know how valued they are. offer to have them over for dinner. send them a tip. send them job recommendations. service industry folks have always shown up for us; now, show up for them. #COVID19

#Facebook, #Google, #Microsoft, #Twitter and #Reddit said they are teaming up to provide accurate information about the #coronavirus and the #Covid-19 illness it causes.
An important factor with the #coronavirus  pandemic is Time. How long before the majority of the population gets infected? How long before there is a vaccine or cure? How long before it #mutates to a deadlier strain? How long will we be In isolation?
We need to unite as one species NOW to defeat this #pandemic, so we can get back to global warming! It‚Äôs cold out!		#COVID„Éº19  #coronavirus #GlobalWarming
At what point can the American people get tested for the #coronavirus that are not showing symptoms?  I have called our local and county public health offices and they do not have the number of tests needed to test possible asymptotic people.  #HowDoWeStopTheSpread ? #Frustrated
someone should set up a pay it forward scheme so we can look after the elderly. #COVID19

NOW would be a GREAT time to support local businesses. As a small business owner, what is happening with the #Coronavirus greatly impacts my family and many other local families.
I feel like the United States' response to this pandemic was: plugging its ears, closing its eyes, and yelling "lalalala". And then this week, the United States finally opened its eyes and was like "shoot, that usually works. There goes plan A, B, and C!" #coronavirus #COVID19
All it takes is for one teacher or student to have #coronavirus and they don‚Äôt need to be a #superspreader but my guess is it would be super spreading in a school!
