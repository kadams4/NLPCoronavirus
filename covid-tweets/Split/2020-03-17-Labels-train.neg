Who cares about #coronavirus, TOM BRADY IS LEAVING NEW ENGLAND.
This whole Corona shit is such a mess that I kinda feel infected already ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è	#coronavirus #COVID19 #coronavirusdeutschland
True. Like trump said, #Covid19 is a Chinese virus. It's time people style up and stop eating crap. You've seen its risky for everybody. Those guys eat monkeys also. Corona virus might also be a punishment for what they do to dogs. #QuarantineLife
They have alienated all of us from each other, everyone is a potential carrier.	The ultimate divide and conquer. #coronavirus
Greed really is the new virus #COVID19
At what point do you cancel your vacation and go back home...? after the safari  right? #coronavirus
What shits me about this whole #coronavirus is that doomsday preppers are going to think they‚Äôre right. I guess they won‚Äôt have trouble self isolating though since no one wants to be around them.
Has anyone even thought about Cinco de Mayo?  America needs to eat tacos &amp; drink margaritas outside #coronavirus
Thanks Wuhan for spreading your sh!$&amp;y virus and closing down the world! #COVID19
Check out Event 201 on youtube		Awhile ago they did a pandemic  scenario and they used the Corona Virus as the subject		Coincidentally 		#coronavirus
Does anyone else thought..what if the #WuhanVirus #ChinaVirus #COVID19 was there like maybe 3 years ago or longer?But when u had those kind of symptoms the Doctors were all like "mhh yeah..U got the #flu"!they didnt knew about that virus bc they didnt tested patients.. curiousü§î
If the coronavirus is gonna prove anything it‚Äôll be the power of the media. #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak
The media better hope the threat is real. Because if the people find out this is a cold and they had total panic over it Trump will win bigger than anybody can imagine.		#ChinaVirus #COVID19
Can the media announce everytime someone gets the common Flu and we can compare the numbers against #Coronavirus #shutdownforwhat
China released this on the world and they are not helping at all. They are holding back all information on the outbreak. They must be removed as a member of the WTO. Bring our manufacturing back to the USA! #Coronavirus
I wish the "powers" would just tell me what's really going on with this so-called corona virus and let me ride out in peace. Some real high level secrets going on, and I want no part of it. #coronavirus #COVID19 #manipulation #plan
I‚Äôm so sick of this damn #coronavirus. It has now ruined #WrestleMania and everything else I‚Äôve been looking forward too. When‚Äôs the cure gonna come out?!
Destroying the entire global economy because of the sniffles is the most 2020 thing ever. #COVID19 #coronavirus
I've been thinking about it and for most of us it's at least TWO WEEKS until our next drug test. Who's tryna get weird? #CoronavirusOutbreak
Off to work on a train. Not sure if this is necessary travel? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm guessing so since no-one is telling me otherwise. On the plus side it's nice and quiet for me to get some uni work done #whoknows #coronavirus
25,000 People die every day due to hunger virus in the world, while its vaccine is called "food" but you will never see any debate on it in the world. 		Do you know why? Because no rich dies of starvation.		#coronavirus
Dogs created COVID-19 to make their owners stay home and give them cuddles. #coronavirus #COVID19au
Am I the only one who thinks the news are hiding something deeper? The way they keep going on about this #coronavirus to distract our concerns.
At this point, I‚Äôm more worried about the COVID-19 panic than the virus itself. Everything is closing soon. Our society is overreacting to this virus. 	#coronavirus
What if the #coronavirus is just the greatest April fools joke of all time
Bruh what if all this bs is to distract us from the fact planets are aligning and new planets are starting to show, could aliens be on the horizon??? #COVID19
More people will be affected by the fall out from all this scaremongering than will be from the #coronavirus itself. It is deeply saddening, however on the scale it is nothing in comparison to other illnesses/diseases. Tell me, what is the underlying reason behind all this shit?
Who was the first person to even have this corona virus??! I just wanna talk üò°#coronavirus #COVID19
Does anyone else have Boomer parents who won‚Äôt take this virus seriously? It‚Äôs maddening! #coronavirus #boomerflu #babyboomers #socialdistancing #stayhome
We're not going to let the #coronavirus keep us from doing what we always do on St. Paddy's day.
Now that China is getting back to normal, Americans should make their way over there and reintroduce the virus to their population. It‚Äôs only fair. #CoronavirusOutbreak
