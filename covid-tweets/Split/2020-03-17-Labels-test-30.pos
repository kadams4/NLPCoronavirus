You know what? It’s okay to be scared. This is a scary time. We have never seen something like this before. The virus is scary. The economy is scary. The way people are acting is scary. Don’t let anyone make you feel bad for being scared of what’s going on right now. #coronavirus

I’m glad the fed gov’t is working on a stimulus, but workers who are laid off and ineligible for unemployment are going to need more than $1,000 to weather this. We are talking months here, not weeks. #COVID19 #coronavirus
