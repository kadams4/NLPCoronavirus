Dear Coronavirus, please don’t take the 2020 MLB Season Away. #Covid_19
I'm all for dropping a nuke on China. They need to pay for this ruckus #coronavirus
Y'all really still tryna have a spring break with #coronavirus spreading
Another Dr who has become a #coronavirus expert. They keep lowering the age of it being serious - it was 70, then 65, now it's 60. But everyone younger will be okay if they get it. 🤔
Someone tell the Indians using deodorant will keep #coronavirus away from them😐
The worst part about this #coronavirus is my cable off 🤦🏾‍♀️
Can everyone chill about the #coronavirus ? It was made in China it won’t last long. 😂
The one good thing about #covid19, way fewer people on public transport.
