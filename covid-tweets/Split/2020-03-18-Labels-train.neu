As more countries go into #lockdown people are having to grapple with a host of emotions. The fear, the uncertainty, the loneliness , the helplessness. Don’t despair. #covid19 may be spreading like wildfire but the Almighty’s in total control! He knows what we’re going through!

I know I'm repeating myself at this point but the last few days have been really inspiring. Despite all of our differences, people really do care about other people. I'm seeing it every day now. Through the fear and the uncertainty, we will take care of one another.		#Covid_19
Pls be kind to retail staff, NHS workers, care workers, delivery drivers, any key workers bc we are working through the pandemic. And when it finally starts to slow we will still be expected to work with no time to decompress. Thank you. - a v.tired shelf stacker 	#COVID19

From ENT colleague in Madrid: ANOSMIA be a presenting sign of #COVID19. 14 cases seen today. Patients with acute loss of smell should be advised to monitor for cough/fever, seen via #Telemedicine only, and ideally tested #medtwitter
#Covid_19 started from china and then spreaded over the world.
Makes me mad how #EU was in the last 6 months totally absorbed by  climate (as important as it is ) not leaving any bandwith to prepare with the impending #coronavirus crisis which could destroy Europe as we know it. We have reason to be worried what this means for democracy.
Have to admit I'm a little behind the technologies. Just learning how to use #Slack and #zoom in order to run a lab remotely under #coronavirus... any tips?

So the Governor of the Bank of England has just asked stock market traders to put ethics over profit during the #COVID19 crisis. Is he a moron? That is so unlikely it’s not even worth the breath to ask.
#coronavirus Steven Barclay on GMB has just said its only over 70s who need to take social distancing advice. Totally at odds with Johnson last night saying everyone avoid large or small gatherings #COVID2019 Govt in a muddle
Some Dr said people would eat healthier bc of #coronavirus, I stocked my house with the most calorie rich foods with the longest shelf life and have been eating fast food to not hit my stockpile, so yeah.

My kiwi saver (I live in New Zealand) has dropped at least 7k 😭😭😭 That money is our first home deposit. My partner has also lost thousands. The financial effect alone from #COVID19 is huge. My brain is playing catch up as each day unfolds
Brexit was about closing our borders to Europe. Yet as soon as we have an actual problem that has catastrophic potential and needs containment, we keep the borders wide open! Mental. #coronavirus #brexit #proudremainer
Do you think this has effected the swinger community ? #coronavirus #COVID2019 #stayhomechallenge #CoronavirusOutbreak
I hear complaints that young ppl aren’t taking #coronavirus seriously, but my boomer neighbors heading out for a St. Paddy’s celebration in full Irish regalia yesterday, beg to differ.
Imagine if sanitizers were a thing and you could wear a mask to save yourself and you could self isolate yourself and say fuck off to your boss and imagine if India was going through a Pandemic like rest of the world. But thank god we are safe because bRo GaUmUTrA.	#COVID19

Government plan to provide £330bn to help business owners and homeowners during the #covid19 crisis.  What about those of us who are employees, or/and who rent?  What help is there for us?  I guess this is what people voted for.

When it comes to data, sometimes the trend line *is* the answer you’re looking for. 		But with diseases there is so much more lurking under the surface. Especially true with #COVID19. Don’t read too much into the numbers right now. Lots more to unfold.
Corona Virus came to teach the world that nothing, I repeat NOTHING is more important than LIFE. Since they couldn't learn that the easy way, they had to learn it the hard way.		#CoronaVirusUpdate 	#COVID19 	#CoronaVirusChallenge 	#coronaviruske
One of the interesting things about #coronavirus and the healthcare system is that it shows you that even in a Capitalistic society we still have limited resources. Your accessibility to healthcare is still prioritized. You can still pay an arm and leg and be turned away.
Quite literally whats happened recently is,by voting Tory,thousands of people have been condemned 2the mercy of #coronavirus.We have the means 2test people,especially frontline NHS staff,but we're not doing this.All we've been told by Boris 'Churchill' Johnson is #Chinup Britain!
