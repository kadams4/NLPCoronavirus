Don't you think you can't get infected with corona hence you are free to roam around. Don't take it lightly. Stay at home. 		#Covid_19
If you love your family then STAY AT HOME for their sake, please don't become a threat to your own family. #IndiaFightsCorona #CoronaStopKaroNa #CoronavirusOutbreakindia #COVID19 #mumbailockdown #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus
Really saddened by the #Covid_19 tragedy in #Italy. Unfortunately part of the problem is the endemic ignorance and acceptance of mediocrity which affects the country bar some heights of excellence like the heroes fighting in our hospitals. I hope this will be a wake up call.
#CoronaVirus Want to be Patriotic ? ? Then stay at home ! !
I’m worried if things get worse with #Covid_19 I’m on crutches atm and everything’s a struggle, I can’t go to the shops and do a food shop. But also it’s just going to get harder to get into the doctors atm! I don’t have a major injury but still!

Respective state authorities, please seal state borders for 14 days to arrest the transmission of virus inside and outside. Restrict public movement in the interest of public health. Do not allow gathering of more than 5-6 people at a place. 🙏🏻		#CoronavirusPandemic	#Covid19India
