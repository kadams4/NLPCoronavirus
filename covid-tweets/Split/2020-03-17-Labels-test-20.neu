Slightly bemused by people promoting more extreme measures for the community, yet posting pics of close social contact events at the same time? #wtf #everyonesanexpertNOT #COVID19
Why is #ResignBorisJohnson trending..... fkn Morons he is following the advice of fkn experts not... Keyboard warriors or piers Morgan and the constant Doom &amp; Gloom the BBC are doling out 24/7 .... #BackBoris #coronavirus Keep Calm and Carry on !!!👍🇬🇧
Or they'll get fired for just not showing up to work... That's where I'm at. I touch money, come into contact with TONS of people but I can't get fired. Not now.		That's why I'm not shitting on people for not staying at home: I'm angry at the #government.😑		#COVID19	#Coronavirus
I know I’m retweeting a lot of #coronavirus stuff and it’s because this is so scary. I went to the store and all the shelves were empty and i couldn’t touch anything. If you get the Coronavirus, I really hope you survive and be well. This is really scary 🥰🙄
Once they get a corona vaccine, I don’t want to see any of you  antivaxxers getting one. Don’t be a hypocrite. 😂	#coronavirus #coronavirusaus #COVID19au #covid19australia #COVID19 #antivaxx #vaccine
