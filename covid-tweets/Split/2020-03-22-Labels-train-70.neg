Postie said Royal Mail announced full pay &amp; no disciplinarians for excessive sick leave. Next day 13 at his depot called in sick. People been laid off, desperate for work &amp; others swinging the lead.  Despicable!  Don’t deserve jobs 😡 #Covid_19
Just got turned away to hike a mountain😕 #socialdistance #covid19
Almost a month has passed since the quarantine in Japan. I’m not so scared of #coronavirus anymore, but getting scared ppl are so quiet here. There’s no longer a panic, an abuse, a line for the paper. But smth weird. I feel ppl are sunk into stress n have forgotten how to relax.
I’m not tryna be a conspiracy theorist here.. I know ppl are getting sick and everyone is trying to self isolate. But there’s something bigger in the works #covid19 #CoronaVirus .. maybe it’s just me, I’m trippin 🤷‍♀️
#Coronavirus #Covid19 #Covid_19 is a #scam. Why?	Most deaths are old people and with pre-diseases (cancer, hypertension,...etc) which can all cause death.	Death rates are inflated bcos of the detection sample driven by old people who visit hospitals regulary vs young ones.
