So I lost my job/s because of #COVID19. And knowing that theres no job anymore and still finishing the final shift was pretty bad feeling. As long as everyone is safe and this thing calms down, I think I am ok with it. No income but yes I will be ok. #australialockdown
üö®üö®üö® Webber Fitness Center is CLOSED Indefinitely üö®üö®üö® 		Per Gov DeSantis‚Äô Executive Order the fitness Center is closed until further notice. 		Please keep practicing #SocialDistancing &amp; other proper hygiene habits. #COVID19
I think it might help if people either 65+ or younger but medically compromised to share #AtRisk &amp; say why they need EVERYONE to stay home to help people understand. People may not realize who they are putting at risk around them.		#COVID19 #COVID #StaySafe #StayAtHomeSaveLives
Hey, guys. Remember, like, 3 weeks ago, when things were mostly normal?	.	.	.	Yeah, me neither. #covid19 #StayHome
This one is for the history books along with the plague, 1918 flu etc		The decisions we all make play a huge part in how this unfolds for the future generations		Hopefully they will look back in decades from now at the wise choices we all made #Covid19 #StayAtHomeSaveLives #NHS
If my life was really like The Truman Show, this season would be so boring. Hopefully sweeps is coming up üôèüèº #lockdown #StayHome #COVID19 #SocialDistancing
Wanna do something for your country? #StayAtHome 		#StayHomeStaySafe #corona #coronavirus
Chatted with some religious people and they strongly believe that religion can protect them from Covid19. Yes/maybe but extra caution won‚Äôt hurt. It‚Äôs time we use social influencers such as religious, indigenous leaders, etc to convey the safety message #SocialDistancing #COVID19
My true talent of being a homebody is absolutely paying off now.  Years of preparation and now I can shine!!! #StayAtHome #COVID19 #ihavenolife
Dear Citizens,	Its #lockdown #Karanataka 	No movement on roads.	#Covid19.
To anyone not self-isolating.		I blame you if you ruin my summer plans of pints in beer gardens...... 		The quicker we begin self to self isolate the quicker this all ends.		Don't make this stretch on longer than necessary		#COVID19ireland #Coronavirus
End of day for #COVID19 new cases is here: US daily growth was 29.7%, down from 38.7% yesterday. A lot better than I expected. 		Must keep going. We will get to the end of this nightmare together.		#StayHome
Really want to throat punch my brother and sister in law. They are not taking self isolation seriously, at all, and are endangering my nephew aka my favorite human on the GD planet. We're in Florida and most Floridians also aren't taking this shit seriously. #COVID19 #StayHome
Don't go out stay home stay safe #COVID19
I can't decide what im more outraged about at the moment. The spring break idiots or the parents who named their kid Dick Pound.  #COVIDIOTS #IOC #coronavirus
We can‚Äôt just give up on social distancing, but we can‚Äôt let the economy collapse. In cases like these, we need a strong, measured response from our government. #government #economy #COVID19
I haven‚Äôt left my house in 5 days, which really isn‚Äôt that long yet, but I think it‚Äôs actually the longest time I‚Äôve ever done that in my adult life. Might as well set a personal record. #COVID19 #StayHome
I really wish all counties in Houston would put out a "Stay at home" order. I live in #galvestoncounty but work in #Harriscounty so now I'm all sorts of confused. #coronavirus #COVID19 #Texas
Some people just don‚Äôt get it! Social distancing means stay the fuck home and only interact with those in your immediate household and only go out when absolutely necessary. If you‚Äôre still going out to hang out with your friends to habe fun, you‚Äôre part of the problem!! #COVID19
