Don't know why people are hesitating to get consulted by the doctor. If somebody feels that he/she is n't fine or have any symptoms of corona virus. They must consult with required authorities. Why running away and making others life difficult?	#CoronavirusPandemic	#KanikaKapoor
Stay at home plzzüôè		#CoronaVirus

Back in 2008, I had H1N1, I was a contracted employee and was not allowed to stay home and self-isolate &amp; recover. I was told that I HAD to stay at work, regardless of who might be exposed to my virus. I am glad to see #covid19 being taken seriously.
Here‚Äôs a tip if you insist on going to a supermarket and queuing up. Place the length of the trolley between you and the person in front of you. That‚Äôs a nice distance so you at least put yourself at least risk. #SocialDistance #Covid_19
Respective state authorities, please seal state borders for 14 days to arrest the transmission of virus inside and outside. Restrict public movement in the interest of public health. Do not allow gathering of more than 5-6 people at a place. üôèüèª		#CoronavirusPandemic	#Covid19India
Took my 4 yr old for a walk yesterday. We walked by 3 parks but told him that he couldn't play with the other kids because of #COVID19. Perhaps all of Canada should close playgrounds for now. Social distancing ?Saw way too many groups of kids "socializing". Everyone, do your part
#coronavirusinindia: #Mysuru reports its first #COVID19 positive case. Be safe.
Multiple 5‚Äôs, 6‚Äôs and one groups of TWELVE! in Bushy Park exercising. The longer we don‚Äôt socially distant ourselves the longer this goes on! #Covid_19 #COVID19ireland
Pakistan must move towards a #lockdownpakistan. Every hour, every day  that we delay is going to make dealing with the pandemic more difficult. Stay at home to protect yourselves &amp; others... #CoronavirusPandemic
Did anyone watch coverage of the flame lighting ceremony in Japan?		Officials were packed like a can of sardines into several rows of chairs. THAT‚ÄôS NOT SOCIAL DISTANCING.		I‚Äôm not sure how much faith I would put into the decisions made by this group.		#COVID19
