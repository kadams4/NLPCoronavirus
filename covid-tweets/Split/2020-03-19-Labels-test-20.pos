Whatever Modi said today we should follow strictly.	To keep ourselves and others safe!!#JantaCurfew #CoronaVirusUpdate #coronavirus
Closings, lockdowns, cancellations. Not fun. A bummer. But necessary. Take it seriously. Save lives. #COVID19
Ya‚Äôll want ya‚Äôll jobs back? Stay inside for two weeks! Or go outside and spread the virus and have 3 months of unemployment. Your choice! #coronavirus #reality #stupidity #oops
Don't be fooled this is not a fight we can win. However we can slow the damage so we don't get knocked out in the first round. #COVID19 #FlattenTheCurve
1/2 Already being such an anxious person, I‚Äôm finding going out food shopping so stressful &amp; uncomfortable. I went to 5 different shops today to try and get food - the shelves were all empty. Grown men were chasing workers down the isles to get toilet roll ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.. #COVID19
We call on the international community to intervene to protect the Palestinian prisoners from #coronavirus by taking preventive measures recommended by WHO.	#SavePalestinePrisoners
I‚Äôm glad grocery stores are making accommodations for the elderly and other vulnerable members of our communities. I‚Äôm saddened that they have to do so because members of our communities are too selfish in their panic. #coronavirus
For those parents out there that think it‚Äôs ok to let their kids play out whilst the schools are closed, YOURE ALL FUCKING IDIOTS!!! It‚Äôs not an extended holiday. It‚Äôs to keep them away from other kids to stop the spread! #coronavirus #schoolclosuresuk
Sweden now only country that hasn‚Äôt closed its schools?!? What is going on here? #coronasweden #corona #sweden #Coronavirus
#Covid19 	When one of your child's teeth falls, reassure him that there will be another tooth for him in a while.But when you fall, can anyone assure him? Stay home so that your family doesn't smile
I'm frustrated by the prevalence of people spewing what they "believe" about #COVID19 publicly. This isn't a religious ideology. Science trumps your beliefs. Over 470 people died in Italy today, this is more dangerous than the flu.
1)Private/public medical universities hospitals can be declared as quarantine ,  2)Governor houses,State guests houses &amp; 5 star hotels can be taken over for keeping critical patients, Khan must act NOW along with all CMs to safeguard nation from #CoronaVirus
The best way to control the spread of #COVID19 is: 1. Pray vigoursly to seek forgiveness and protection from God. 2. Adopt cleanliness measures to the extent as if u have the virus to protect others from it and as if everyone else have a virus  to protect yourselves from it.
I have all the symptoms of the #coronavirus (I feel absolutely dreadful &amp; yes I‚Äôm self-isolating) but how do I know that it‚Äôs not just the flu? I quarantine myself for 2 weeks and then head back out into the world to only catch something I thought I‚Äôd already had? #COVID19
Paid leave for everyone including all househelps	More pay for doctors, nurses, medical, paramedical staffs	Avoid planned med checkup	Avoid non-essential online services	Be kind to each other		#JantaCurfew #COVID2019india #Covid19India #covidindia #COVID19 #coronavirus #corona
#COVID19 love. Love. LOVE. when my mom- who 1) is an older person 2) was hospitalized with pneumonia 14 MONTHS ago- has gone to a massively crowded sam‚Äôs club like TWICE this week. IT IS WEDNESDAY!!!!!
I am not at all thrilled with Japan‚Äôs response to the #COVID19  pandemic. Apart from the closing of schools, it is business as usual... packed malls/bars &amp; crowded trains. Testing is hard to come by. Only govt facilities offer the test but only if high fever for 4 straight days.
