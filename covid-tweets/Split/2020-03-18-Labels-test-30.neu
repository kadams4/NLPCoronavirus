Working from home during this #quarantine is next level. I’m mucking sushi, naked, wrapped in a blanket burrito and everyone thinks we’re closed so there’s NO calls 😂 #ontariolockdown #coronavirus #covid19
Honestly tho should we not just cancel #BBCAN8 or what? This Jamar situation is such a joke, we’ve got the #COVID19 global crisis happening and there is hundreds of staff in close quarters that work on the show... this season is also scheduled to be extended...I just can’t 🤦🏻‍♂️
Some Dr said people would eat healthier bc of #coronavirus, I stocked my house with the most calorie rich foods with the longest shelf life and have been eating fast food to not hit my stockpile, so yeah.
Has a cure for #coronavirus been announced as toilet rolls and pasta?!? #wtf
#CoronaVirus Sodium hypochlorite is very effective in killing the virus. 	We can prepare from Bleaching powder.	There a stock solution available in markets with Wholesalers not retailers.	It can be diluted to desired concentration with help of Chemistry graduates here.
Have to admit I'm a little behind the technologies. Just learning how to use #Slack and #zoom in order to run a lab remotely under #coronavirus... any tips?
All companies already seeking a bailout should immediately leverage their space, their workforce and any other useful resources towards building makeshift hospitals, beds, etc.  We cant just bailout companies for nothing, they need to work together. #COVID19
They postponed black Christmas 😭😭😭 Totes understandable tho 	#NAIDOC #coronavirus
Pause..Breathe...Talk to someone you love... don’t lose it yourself right now. #coronavirus #mentalhealth
Something bad is about to happen. I just don’t know what. #COVID19
This situation is a real eye opener, so many selfish and self-centred people in today’s society, it’s such a shame. #coronavirus #COVID19
Corona virus has made me so bored that I worked out today #coronavirus #springbreak2020 #yaaard
New cooties #coronavirus
As more countries go into #lockdown people are having to grapple with a host of emotions. The fear, the uncertainty, the loneliness , the helplessness. Don’t despair. #covid19 may be spreading like wildfire but the Almighty’s in total control! He knows what we’re going through!
Parkruns cancelled-just as I was starting to enjoy it #CoronaVirus
Who’d have thought that we’d be missing the word #brexit now #Coronavirus has taken over our lives
me realising that i can’t go to musical theatre tonight bc i’m self isolating and because of #coronavirus musical theatre classes might be cancelled which means we might not get to do the wind in the willows in june. PLEASE JUST GO AWAY ALREADY #COVID2019
So the Governor of the Bank of England has just asked stock market traders to put ethics over profit during the #COVID19 crisis. Is he a moron? That is so unlikely it’s not even worth the breath to ask.
Corona Virus came to teach the world that nothing, I repeat NOTHING is more important than LIFE. Since they couldn't learn that the easy way, they had to learn it the hard way.		#CoronaVirusUpdate 	#COVID19 	#CoronaVirusChallenge 	#coronaviruske
Today, for the first time in my life, I went to shake someone's hand and they pulled away. I instantly felt like a muppet. 		#coronavirus #COVID19
