As of this evening, #Ontario with 37% of Canada’s pop’n has completed only 18% of the nation’s #covid19 tests, yet reports 21% of the cases.		Not keeping up with the rest of the country on testing, so undoubtedly under-reporting cases.		Failing on #ChristineElliott’s promise.

#COVID19 was the best thing to happen to #Jamaica: Everywhere's 'clean',  the stock market's affordable, people get a break from nonsensical plantation life and it's generally less noisy and the shocking part: government showed it can actually put its foot down (sceptic)
I’ve worked at the same job for 15 years. FIFTEEN years at an primary care clinic. Today I was told that everyone’s hours will be cut due to the #COVID19 outbreak. Primary care isn’t the concern right now. So yeah, I’m nervous AF about money now... 😔		#CoronavirusPandemic

I honestly feel for all the pregnant women. At this point, no one is allowed to accompany them to their appointments. I’ve also heard this rule may also apply when they give birth. I can’t imagine giving birth alone 🥺🥺🥺 #COVID19 🙏🙏🙏

#coronavirus in my theory, to keep the immunity high, and keep the Corona virus at bay, figs and bananas need to be consumed alot. Keep the potassium level, natural sugars and vitamin k and a levels up. While the fever is kept under check with paracetamol.
