On my timeline I am trying to reflect the most accurate opinion &amp; information I am coming across. I am not intending to be alarmist or dramatic. I am truly incensed about the lack of government action at a time when prevention is so important to save lives. #coronavirus #coronaau
Have food companies thought about food delivery services during a lockdown? Have the delivery people wear protective gear and have them deliver things to households that need these things? #CoronavirusOutbreak #CoronaVirusSA #Covid_19
Let's exercise extra caution during this period everyone. We will get through this pandemic. #COVID19
Don't fool yourself.  The threat is real. 	#coronavirusinpakistan #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID2019
Our 6-month old son has a really rare heart defect so #corona #COVID19 could be really really dangerous for him ! Thanks for #SocialDistancing and #StayAtHome ! ‚ù§You are saving lifes !
The spread of Covid-19 is out of control, we must postpone all primaries until this is under control. Knowing the American election system, these primaries will result in hundreds standing in lines for hours on end. This is definitely a disaster waiting to happen. #coronavirus
Stay home and stay safe everyone üíô	#COVID19
This week is crucial in the UK for taking #covid„Éº19uk #Coronavirus very seriously. I‚Äôm avoiding uni dorms and spending my time at home regardless of my Uni‚Äôs guidelines (which are yet to be announced fully).
No joke. #COVID19 stays active on up to 3 days on plastic and metal and at least one day on cardboard. Once ya get back in wash everything.
Why won‚Äôt people listen to the experts? If frontline healthcare providers aren‚Äôt scared and are *trying* to explain sensible information, why would you not listen? Your google search and tv anchor did not make you more knowledgeable. üí° #healthcare #Frontlines #COVID19 #FixRx
If you're sad because a gig or a festival is cancelled please consider the musician who was due to play. This is hiting them so so hard. Buy music, support artists #CoronavirusOutbreak

Take the time and show some gratitude, or in the LEAST be patient. These and the upcoming weeks are when we need to start showing our humanitarianism to EVERYONE. Not just ourselves.	#coronavirus #BeKind
Is it sad to have to consider cancelling events due to all the #coronavirus stuff? Yeah.		Is it good to at least consider people's concerns and seek alternatives or delays for those events? Also yes.
No more games. üòü Looks Like we will have to balance our jobs and the kids. Wife at the clinic, myself in a project packed time in the chaotic heathcare right now. Everyday a new surprise. #coronavirus #COVID19 #ShutDownGermany
Idris Elba been tested positive of the Coronavirus. For some reason, this just breaks my heart. üò™üíî		#CoronavirusOutbreak
Whether or not you recognize the seriousness or legitimacy of the coronavirus, what will also be serious and extremely concerning is the economic impact it will have on us. We need to prepare for THAT too. #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirus
I have heard that #Covid19 has also struck in the USA. I advise you not to leave your house. Always wash your hands and buy masks and latex gloves. In ITALY, the supermarkets are always open and there is no lack of food. A strong hug to all. ü§ó
Only 1 confirmed case of COVID-19 in ND and they decided to close the schools here. While I want my kid in school, this is the right call.		#COVID19 #coronavirus
All those people moaning about not being able to go on holiday.. think of all those at risk of going unpaid for weeks on end or even losing their jobs! You will get a refund!! They won‚Äôt!! #covid„Éº19uk #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID19 #coronavirus #coronavirusuk #CoronaVirusUpdates
I‚Äôd like the candidates to speak on what they would plan to do for #smallbusiness in the wake of #coronavirus - many can‚Äôt afford to be closed for two+ weeks and might have to close permanently. How do we help them stay open? #DemDebate
So the government have told the elderly to stay in doors but supermarkets are rationing toilet paper to 1 pack per customer. How am I supposed to help out those that can‚Äôt shop? #coronavirus #SelfIsolation #panicbuyinguk
Be Safe from #coronavirus infection

Comes to something when you feel you'd be better off living in a country presently more affected by #COVID19.		But seeing the community spirit of those in lockdown as well as hearing the news of how governments are responding makes me feel like we're lightyears behind in the UK.
More than 750 coronavirus cases, 42 deaths in Washington State.... WTF #coronavirus
If the govt is going to force everything to shut down, they should be doing something about PAY so everyone doesn‚Äôt go into debt, starve, or have their credit ruined because no paycheck equals no way to pay bills for most of us #coronavirus #coronapocolypse
Crisis like no other . Don't panic , maintain social distance and stay at home as long as possible.	#coronavirusindia	#IndiaFightsCorona	#coronavirus
