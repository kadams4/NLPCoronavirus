There seems to be less #coronavirus news today
My three year counting the #covid19 curve:	"1,2, A lot"	Sums it up really.	(Incidentally how he nominates how many pieces of cake he should get...)
Folks....it‚Äôs very simple why the media and left won‚Äôt give Trump any credit. They can‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt want to lose an election in November. Their hate of the President is more important than the citizens of the USA. #COVID19
Hey guys, just a reminder that we could have taken care of this a way long time ago if someone led our country with either competence or a heart. Okay, thanks! #Covid_19
JUST IN: 3 New #coronavirus Deaths And 54 New Cases In #China

Both Boris Johnson &amp; Donald Trump changed their strategy midway through the pandemic &amp; embraced actions experts had recommended for months.Those early failures were a proximate cause of the deaths of many. If this were a company we might be looking at criminal charges.#Covid_19
The thing dangerous than #COVID19 is the incompetent people at the top post of Government and equally all these deluded irresponsible citizens.
Through reading and talking to fellow healers, I have come to understand that the initial symptoms of #COVID19 is the loss of sense of smell and taste.	Avoid mucus formation foods, keep your bowels clear, take deep breaths, stay safe and keep others safe.
2 	Pandemics just make an already challenging situation more difficult. #COVID19 is truly adding to folks‚Äô challenges. This is truly a space for some serious sustained team work.
I don‚Äôt understand why so many deaths in Italy - seriously 		Do anybody has a serious answer ? 		#coronavirus #italy #wtf #sosad
As each and every breath these days seems to be taken more deeply and sincerely...it feels appropriate to be reminded that a human word for god and the divine is ‚ÄòYahweh‚Äô - a term that specifically requires us to simply breathe. #bestill #breathe #YHVH #Covid_19
There is an unease in the atmosphere as we deal with #Covid_19 People are scared and losing hope. We must try to live in these uncertain times, with our Faith anchored in God.."In Christ the solid Rock I stand" #CoronaChronicles

2. US will cross million cases within 1-2 weeks, most likely they will go untested for a while. No health system can contain or test 1 million people in a day or a week.		By the time the 1M being tested, God knows how many more might be infected. #COVID2019 #coronavirus

Eating Oreos before dinner. #covid19
Day 14 of #FlattenTheCurve: Kids and other families gave a birthday parade for girl in culdesac. My older kid told my wife she is afraid of my wife, her mom getting #COVID19 and dying; OMG!  Whitefish salad for lunch, pork tacos for dinner; food delight.

I only think it's fair that if you survive #COVID19 that you should be imbued with the powers of a bat or pangolin
I was shocked at the amount of people with masks on in the grocery store. 	Not the N95 masks, regular masks. 		Bless my heart,  that won't protect you against #COVID19
Respected Sir situation is very critical. People don't want to understand the situation. Please deploy Army. Otherwise situation is going to be out of control.	  #coronavirus

For 108 years we have criticized the Titanic for not having enough life boat space for all passengers. 	However we, in 2020, live in a country with only 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 citizens.  	Side note: 31 other countries come ahead of us in beds per 1000  citizens. #COVID19
Got laid off this week, and I wanna say how thankful I am for the people around me who keep me up! Also actually thankful for the govt for once in actually getting this stimulus stuff done. If anyone needs a Digital Analyst, hit me up! #COVID19 #DigitalMarketing #jobless
I wish TikTok would get the #COVID19
It took a Pandemic to realize how many things I took for granted #CoronavirusOutbreak
This #coronavirusoutbreak is more stressful for the family. Doing my best to keep sanitized and safe. But, fear of the invisible killer lingers on, taking a mental toll on my mother, wife, son, who are petrified every time I walk out of the main door. #COVID19
#COVID19 got my sleeping pattern outta wack
Once this is over the, the super rich are going to be super duper rich. #COVID19
So #COVID19 is not completely ruled out for me. Pneumonia is getting no better in current antibiotics. What does this mean for me. 		More meds and back into full blown quarantine again. 		Someone kill me please.
After the dust settle from #COVID19 companies and corporation will going to invest heavy on #technology specially on #remotework and #BYOD

It's REALLY bothering me how folks are using #covid19 as an opportunity to completely DESTROY an entire group of people just because they belong to a certain political party. This goes for both sides of the aisle.		STOP IT.	PEOPLE ARE SICK, DYING, &amp; SUFFERING.  	WE CAN DO BETTER.
#COVID19 has given me so much health anxiety I literally can‚Äôt

Your delivery people remember you and may even remember where you live? Think twice before you skip the #Tips. We *do* flag bad customers and refuse orders from them in the future. Plus- if you skip tips during #CoVid19 you suck and shouldn‚Äôt be ordering #delivery.
The reason being quarantined doesn‚Äôt really phase me Is because during most of my junior and high school years I was grounded. I‚Äôve trained for this like  it‚Äôs an Olympic event. #chynuhvirus #coronavirus  #iftheartofgettinggroundedwasasportingeventidbemichaeljprdan
