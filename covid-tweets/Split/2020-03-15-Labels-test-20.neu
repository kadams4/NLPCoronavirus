truly sad I canâ€™t work. Temp 38, all consuming myalgia+++ = my personal worst symptom, general migrainous headache, dry cough &amp; sore throat since yesterday but no major respiratory symptoms. Good news appear to be 3-5 days behind parents who are improvingðŸ¤ž#covid19 #selfisolating
Got to show #14 how to make an omelet this morning and this is the kind of stuff I'm cherishing with all of this #coronavirus
Iâ€™m in Beaumont hospital and youâ€™d think it would be chaos but no. Itâ€™s a GHOST TOWN. 20 odd people in A+E the night I came in and only 6 people last night. The wards are empty. Unheard of.	Theyâ€™re prepping for all of youâ€™s dopes that went out the weekend ðŸ˜‚ #covid19 #coronavirus

Imagine if people played a drinking game where they turned on the news and drank every time someone said #coronavirus
It is utterly insane that a govt with a history of lying says we are to trust the science and then  declines to offer the evidence base for those scientific decisions. Even though the outcome of all scientific reasoning is obtained through peer scrutiny. #UKGoverment #COVID19
