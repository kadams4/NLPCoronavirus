Dear Fellow Floridians, for the love of stopping this Coronavirus Apocalypse as soon as possible, please take isolation &amp; social distancing seriously! We aren't trying to take away your Spring Break or vacation, we are trying to save lives. #shutdownflorida #COVID19
If lives can be saved by staying at home from #CoronavirusPandemic so everyone should follow this if somebody tries break #lockdown should be fined or punished by Govt		#StayAtHomeSaveLives
I'm super impressed by my little brother. Crazy times and he has just got on with it! Done his school work from home, followed what people have told him to do with distancing, no complaints at all! If an 11 year old can do it you can too! #COVIDー19 #coronavirus #homeschooling
