We have a virus that is killing people. If we could get past the politics then we could fight it. It does not care about politics, or who did what or when.	 #PresidentTrump	#coronavirus #GOPBailoutScam	#DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica #DemocratsHateAmerica

If you can't help, don't hurt. If you can't heal, don't harm. If you can't harness, don't harass. If you can't bridge, don't breach. Keep others safe and stay safe. #socialdistancing #COVID19 #coronavirus.
If you have to work go to work then go home. If you need groceries go get them then go home. If you need medicine go get it then go home. If you need...wait...want to hang out with friends, don‚Äôt. Stay home! #coronavirus #StayHome #SocialDistancing

Thanks to all of the dozy c***s who thought social distancing advice didn't apply to them. This is why we can't have nice things like trust and some level of freedom. Not because *we* can't. But because *you* ruin it anyway. 	#COVIDIOTS #coronavirus #StayAtHomeSaveLives

I have already called it for weeks. You can ban football matches but it wouldn't make a difference if the public transport is still running. The reduced services makes it worse when more ppl are packed in trains running at lower frequencies. #COVID19 #UKLockdownNow
Now have clear evidence from Italy that shutdown works. US would have egg on face if Europe contains and we let it go crazy. Need full country quarantine for two weeks and then back to business. #coronavirus #covid #RightWingMinorityOpinion
Just Imagine Your Family member in Ventilator and You can't even see and meet them . Imagine your loved once Can't breath and You just can't do anything . Imagine they can't even Cry.This Virus is so much painful even we can't imagine.Plz plz stay home. 	#CoronavirusPandemic
The best way to approach social distancing is to pretend like you already have the virus.	#COVID19NL #COVID„Éº19 #covid19 #COVID19
Never heard so many ambulance sirens in my life. Literaly every 15 minutes. 		My city is hurting. 	Please stay home. üò¢		#SantaClara #California	#coronavirus
Honestly, no one is taking any notice of staying in. I thought the elderly were not allowed out? They‚Äôre out in droves. It‚Äôs the old fuckers that are spreading it. They think they‚Äôre immune #shamblesstayathome #Coronavid19 #coronavirusuk #COVID19 #coronavirus
Health care workers are out here risking their lives and they can‚Äôt go home. We are asked one simple thing, to stay at home and you‚Äôre out roaming the god damn streets thinking this is a fucking vacation! #COVID„Éº19 #StayHome #CoronavirusPandemic #HealthcareHeroes

Those of you worried about money during a global pandemic are forgetting this one simple fact. That money won‚Äôt follow you to the grave. #HowToEnd_CoronaPandemic #lockdown #LockdownNow #COVID19 #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus #pandemic
By all means stay safe. Let's stop the spread of the #Coronavirus. It'll take individual effort to fight this and yes, we will win this fight together.
Do not listen to politicians who recommend drugs for a disease. Listen to the doctors. Listen to the experts. #Covid19 #Coronavirus #LKA #QuarantineLife #Quarantine
The response to COVID-19 has only showed me that the US and UK safe like the two kids in the class always getting in trouble and getting detention because they don‚Äôt listen #medtwitter #COVID19
We are all getting done over by the most microscopic piece of bacteria because people are stupid and won‚Äôt stay in their house and then putting others and the more vulnerable at risk... the world is full of selfish peopleüò¢ #coronavirus #covidiots
Those who are privilege enough to sustain their daily needs in a month or even months of being quarantine, all of their worries are that they are bored, want to go outside, meet their friends, travel etc. #COVID19PH #Covid_19

Tales from a first responder/ health care worker at the front of the #COVID19 pandemic: 		Social distancing is still not stopping strangers from asking me to look at a mole on their groin in the gas station bathroom.
Guys keep social distance and support government with #lockdownindia.	#StayHomeStaySafe	#fightagainstcorona #COVID19
Please stay home if you can and stay safe everyone!! We‚Äôre all in this together!! 	#coronavirus #COVID„Éº19 #CoronavirusPandemic #SocialDistancing #StayAtHome #FlattenTheCurve #GroceryWorkers
Once it is safe to do so, every big city should hold ticker tape parades for its health care workers after we beat back #coronavirus .  HCWs will be the true heroes of this battle. #COVID19 #StayHome
The minister says there are PPEs in the hospital to protect our healthworkers. But we all know how it is on the ground.	#Protectourhealthworkers	#COVID19 #coronaviruskenya

Part 4: Since the U.S. and Canada have agreed to lockdown their borders due to the #Coronavirus, perhaps it's time for us here in the U.S. to consider locking down our nation altogether, and give a 1-week notice to Americans abroad to return home, to prevent any further outbreak.
People I know and love are going on their daily lives like nothing has happened. How can you tell your loved ones to stop being idiots?! #StayAtHomeSaveLives #COVID„Éº19 #listen #coronavirus

I stay in the house the weekend because I'm afraid to infection #coronavirus. But  in #Japan, some people go to hang out. I think it's depends on us that is whether coronavirus can to end. So, I think they should have awareness of crisis more and stay in the house.üè†		#Japanese
Why is nobody asking questions from Modi on how India, a country of over a billion people, is going to survive this pandemic?		In our city #coronavirus transmission is already in stage 3 (community transmission).		In couple of days transmission numbers will be in thousands üò∑
you‚Äôd think the NHS that everyone is praising at the moment would atleast provide doctors and healthcare nurses with clothing that reduces their risk of catching it but nah they expect my mum to continue working.. whereas the logic? #coronavirus #COVID„Éº19 #NHSstaff

#BREAKING: A woman in her 30s has died in the City of St. Louis from #COVID19. This is the first death in the city. This is again a reminder that ANY one, of ANY age, can be impacted by #coronavirus.
The problem with this country, is that we don't take anything seriously. We didn't take Brexit seriously, we didn't take the general election seriously, when voting. Now, we don't take #COVID19 seriously. Wake the fuck up people - this is not a joke! #StayAtHome
Just arrived at Gatwick from Sri Lanka (essentially a third world country) their measures against #coronavirus are infinitely better than ours on the basis ours don‚Äôt exist. Tells you all you need to know about Gov attitude to this. UK need to wake up fast!!
Stay the fuck home guys. #COVIDIDIOTS #COVID19 #StayAtHomeSaveLives
Hopefully people have got the message. Sadly, there will still be the minority that think this is all a joke #COVIDIOTS #StayAtHomeSaveLives #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus
Some people be taking this #CoronaVirus serious on social media but when u tell them to cover their mouth when they cough in public, they wanna fight.
Stay where you are.		Because of this Curfew/Lock down people are fleeing to their natives.		This will increase the spread from metropolitan cities to rural remote locations.		Kindly don't act as carriers and take this virus to the rural areas of the country.		#Covid19	#Corona
The quicker this lockdown happens the quicker all this will be over #LockdownNow #COVID19 #BorisJohnson

Boris Johnson used the same kind of language to talk to the nation as a worried parent might talk to a rebellious teen - c‚Äômon guys it shouldn‚Äôt have to be this way. Stay. At. Home #LockdownNow #StayAtHomeSaveLives #coronavirus
Good afternoon all. I hope your staying home and keeping safe. #COVID„Éº19 #CoronaVirus

Please take precautions against #coronavirus &amp; save yourself in order to save others around you. Events &amp; gatherings can take place later. Please stay home &amp; isolate yourselves just for a few days.
I'm so glad I live in the UK and we have the NHS because in America it looks like truly a shit show #coronavirus #coronavirusuk
Canada needs to go on a total lockdown now. Clearly we are showing we can‚Äôt follow instructions. This is what governments do...look out for people when they need help. Well we need help. Shut everything down. #COVID19
There are seniors I put midst whose respirators will be removed and given to young people who were partying on the beaches just one week ago. Let that sink in. #coronavirus
