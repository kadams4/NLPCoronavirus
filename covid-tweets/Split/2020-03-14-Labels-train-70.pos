Myself and my colleagues are operating business as normal providing not only regular blood and specimen testing but testing for #COVID19. I work with a wonderful bunch of scientists who have worked continuously through storms, snows and now a pandemic to ensure the patient is
The same people that disregarded the Chinese data in January/February are now telling us the China data shows that the virus is receding. 		#COVID19
My parents are taking this coronavirus so seriously that they are bagging up left over onion... just incase they can‚Äôt get to the shops #coronavirus #COVID19

Grocery stores need to move to delivery and online order/pick up only where possible. Provide services to help the elderly order. It would alleviate hoarding of goods and protect the employees as well. #coronavirus #stayathomechallenge
One good thing that‚Äôs come from the #COVID19 is I‚Äôm hearing from good friends I haven‚Äôt in years. Seems to be bringing everyone together üòä
Please my fellow citizens, take the necessary precautions to protect yourself, your family, your friends, etc. These with elderly &amp; ailing family members, take extra care. #coronavirus is no joke and it knows no boundaries.
BREAKING: 23 new cases of #Coronavirus in Denmark. Total reaches 827
Imagine if #COVID19 lasts for longer. Has anybody detailed the consequences to countries economy and to ordinary people. No work, no traveling, no money, no food, and then?
Social distancing and canceling schools/events is of course inconvenient, but so is possibly giving #Covid_19 to someone with a compromised immune system. Canceling/rescheduling events is not over dramatic. It‚Äôs saving lives like mine.
Gas prices going down is not a good thing, guys... hundreds, if not thousands, of oil field families are losing their jobs and subsequently their livelihood. This #Covid_19 virus isn‚Äôt just effecting folks through contracting illness. Worldwide spread panic is also a virus.
For all the staff, EMS, clinical and non-clinical fighting on the front lines of #coronavirus #COVID19 may you be safe, may you remember it‚Äôs ok to not be ok. You matter. #Nursing #NurseTwitter #healthcare

I know we're frightened &amp; scared. I know we're worried for ourselves &amp; our loved ones but PLEASE spare a thought for those doctors, nurses &amp; hospital staff who are at the frontline, working excessive hours &amp; putting their own health at risk to care for us. #COVID19 #NHSThankYou
May Allah Protect everybody from corona virus and other diseases. Aameeen ü§≤üèΩ.   #COVID19 #SaturdayMorning
Here is my #coronavirus fear. IF it settles like a flu season, then we‚Äôre only going to get a global partial break in this fear and insane sense of death and sickness.... and that it will come back next fall. So what are we going to do?. Are we prepared ? Are we gonna see pt 2?
Everyone needs to understand the basic principles of public health, particularly that health is social. #COVID19 is showing that we have a long way to go on this front. This is so important that basic public health needs to be incorporated into every high school curriculum.
Confused?  Why do u need a test to confirm your symptoms? If u think u have #COVID19, quarantine yourself.  There's no treatment you're missing out on.  If you're case is really serious, go to a hospital.
Update: Doctors from other departments will be deployed to ED as currently facing shortage of ED doctors/staffs due to #COVID19 outbreak. 		It‚Äôs happening, guys! üòî	Stay safe everyone! Stay safe healthworkers! Pray for us please, in combating this #COVID„Éº19 	#frontliners
How can they claim that they‚Äôre targeting a steady flow of incoming and outgoing patients to hospitals when they aren‚Äôt testing people? Who knows if they have it? Are they in a rammed pub right now spreading it to hundreds of people? #coronavirus #COVID19
From midnight, all non-essential public places in France will be closed until further notice! It is time for more countries to do the right thing! #FlattenTheCurve #staythefuckhome #covid19 #confinement #pandemic #StopTheSpread

Hearing from friends who are #freelancers #creatives #gigeconomy workers that they‚Äôve already been hit hard by work cancelled due to the #Coronavirus - worrying how they‚Äôre going to survive the coming months. Going to do a story on this - contact me if you‚Äôve been affected ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
This shit is getting out of hand, people blaming the Chinese is NOT OKAY and you shouldn't treat them any different than anyone else because all people no matter race have it it's bullshit #Covid_19
Dear Everone. Wash your hands, stay calm and stay healthy. Act, don't overreact. #Covid_19 is something to take serious, but if we can work together and share our soaps and hand sanitizers (and apparently T.P) then the mortality rate will remain 2 per 100,000 #COVID19 #Facts
If you even have a single symptom that suggests you might possibly have a cold STAY THE F____! HOME‚ÄîU selfish bastard.  #coronavirus #coronapocalypse #Trump #Saturday #CoronavirusUSA #COVID19US #Covid_19 #CoronaVirusUpdates #CoronavirusPandemic
Use Soap and Water to wash hands #COVID19india #COVID19

Wuhan residents are still wearing masks 3 months later.  Americans need to get over the stigma of wearing a mask fast and the government needs to distribute millions of them fast #COVID„Éº19 #Covid_19PH #COVID19 #coronavirus #SaturdayThoughts #covid19ma
Whilst people are angry at airlines spare a thought for the people working for those airlines whose jobs could be at risk. Understandably stressful and worrying times but people‚Äôs jobs could be at risk here #COVID19 #coronavirus #coronavirusuk
Officially in lock down here in Spain, for minimum 15 days, hopefully this will lower our cases and avoid more deaths.	#IWillStayAtHome #YoMeQuedoEnCasa	#QuedateEnTuCasa	#CoronavirusEspa√±a	#Covid_19	#LockDownSpain	#LockDown
So just in case anyone reads this- actually feeling better today, temperature come back down so on the mend. 9 days since I was in contact with someone who was put into isolation for coming into contact with someone with Coronavirus so make of that what you will #coronavirus
Seeing as all these new cases of #COVID19 in SA are from people travelling into the country, one can‚Äôt help but wonder how many cases entered the country before we started testing? Closing borders may make people feel safer, but I think that ship has sailed. #CoronavirusInSA
Cool to see NBA players &amp; organizations helping employees cover their pay, gonna be tough for a lot those people hopefully we see the same energy from other sports. #Covid_19
Trying to figure out this social distancing thing while teaching and working in high school. #coronavirus
#coronavirus. A big salute to the doctors,nurses &amp; the police who are working round the clock to help peopleüëçüèª
well, boris johnson, look where not closing the schools has gotten us so far....	800 cases at 2pm yesterday....	....	1100 cases less than 24 hours later.	Congratulations!	That‚Äôs a 300 case rise in less than 24 hours.	And THAT is a 37.5% rise nationally.	#coronaUK #coronavirus
We are staying open until the closure becomes mandatory which puts us out there for exposure until the last minute but it also gives me a check. I feel like a pawn. There‚Äôll be no check for weeks once we close #coronavirus #work
Let's stay strong and fight the #COVID19 outbreak by taking all precautionary measures. 	Most importantly remember prevention is better than cure. Please take care everyone.	#StaySafe 	#CoronaVirus
Send out healing energy to the world for this #Covid_19
It‚Äôs sad to see some self declared educated aunties/stupid blokes sharing third class non serious tweets about #coronavirus , trying to compare this natural calamity with stupidities of youth in Pakistan with no relevance and common sense. Aunties/weirdos please tweet sense.
it's to dangerous for the students but not for the teachers, administrators, cooks, secretaries, custodians, speech pathologists, and all the other professionals I did not mean to exclude #CoronaVirusUpdates #CoronaOutbreak #COVID19
Social distancing will be a temporary instrument to deal with #Covid_19. However steps taken towards community well-being and sustainable living will matter far more in the long run.
