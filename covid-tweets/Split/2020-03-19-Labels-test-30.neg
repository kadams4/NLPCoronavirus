Think everyone just needs to sit back relax and say, Hakuna Matata🤷🏻‍♂️ #coronavirus
Keep sanity in mind. Do not let the government take full control. People have to work. The government can not support us all. If they could they would already be doing it. We're in extremely dangerous waters. Be brave. Be American. #coronavirus
This #COVID19 is gunna crash our economy &amp; civilization if it carries on for too long.		Those vulnerable should be isolated but everyone else needs to return to normality sooner rather than later
The world leaders probably couldn’t fulfill their vision 2020 promises so they created the #COVID19 🦠 virus to distract the world from asking the tough questions that’ll come sooner or later.
