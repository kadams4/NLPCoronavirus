1)Private/public medical universities hospitals can be declared as quarantine ,  2)Governor houses,State guests houses &amp; 5 star hotels can be taken over for keeping critical patients, Khan must act NOW along with all CMs to safeguard nation from #CoronaVirus
‘We’ll do whatever it takes’ is straight out #Cummings book as with ‘Get Brexit done’ ‘Taking back control’. They need to stop this BS and get on with doing it #CoronaVirusChallenge #lockdownuk #COVID19 #covid19UK #FightCOVID19
Since a lot of people still aren’t taking the proper precautions against #COVID19, bio analysts predict a best case scenario of 30,000 people infected by April 13th. That’s almost half the total infected in China. Next best case scenario? Over 120,000. #CoronaVirusUpdate
"it's just the flu" ok but I don't want the fucking flu either! #coronavirus
listen people are dying that have never died before. be safe 💯 #coronavirus
99% of them are innocent and they're unaware of this situation. So apart from screening, myself and most of my friends are educating them about the risk they're facing now. Just a little step in fighting against #COVID19 	I will continue this until my health allows me 🙏
#coronavirus #JustinTrudeau #DougFord #isolate Like a wildfire that spreads rapidly, we as one people of this world must ALL self contain this from our least affected following the same as worst. Otherwise we  are burning embers risking everything in path~
As a responsible citizen of india ,I would support the government decision of #jantacurfew,we all should support this stand,on Sunday from 7am to 9pm,#COVID2019india #StaySafeStayHome #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdate #Quarantine
I’m part of the high risk group. But I still have to go to work. Choosing bills over health. #coronavirus #DearAmerica
1. We are in the midst of the largest acute public health crisis in my 54 years AND simultaneously the largest financial crisis and this is just the start. Things are and will continue to worsen due to #coronavirus #marketcrash
Why we don’t learn from Other countries about how treat  #coronavirus. China, tested the people and just redirect the people to a different building, to those who were +. Uk is using the same  🏥 4 everybody. So everybody is touching he same lift, the same doors and all around.

#COVID19🦠 🏘	Quebec’s gvmt asks us to limit our travels w/in the Belle Province. I know, it’s difficult. But, there’s 1 goal: SAVING LIVES. Let’s take advantage of 📱💻📞 to share, catch up and stay in touch!Although we’re physically isolated, we’re in this #together #polQC
Kudos to the hospitals that are restricting visitors, no one WANTS to do it, but it the RIGHT decision to keep our patients and staff safe. #coronavirus #COVID19
