Will the coronavirus keep you from going out to eat?? My answer is yes #coronavirus
Iâ€™m worried about my ability to pay a security deposit when my current lease ends. Iâ€™m losing my health insurance, Iâ€™m worried about affording my prescriptions. Iâ€™m so. F*cking. Angry.		/2		#CoronavirusPandemic 	#CoronaOutbreak
Pandemic #coronavirus will give us a great lesson that we are weak creatures, but also the strogest ones as if we unite and hold on all together.		Our enemy is not between us, but something outside humanity which actually we ourselves have made.		Stay strong!
Just a reminder: please be kind to your health care providers #CoronavirusPandemic #fluseason #overwhelmed
#Coronavirus yâ€™all need to stop buying everything. Some people actually donâ€™t have anything yet. I have been looking for hand sanitizer and masks for over 2 weeks now, and still everything is always outta stock. Get what you really need. Donâ€™t take the whole store. ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•
I am talking to so many people at work who have #COVID19 symptoms who are being told they will not qualify for testing for various "reasons." They're told to self-quarentine by their Dr's. We truly dont know the extent of this because of the lack of testing!
