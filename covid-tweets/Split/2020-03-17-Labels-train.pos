Doctors and the whole medical staff are heroes ‚ù§Ô∏è	#coronavirus 	#CoronavirusOutbreak
Just listened to doctors and nurses outside my exam room talk about how they were running out of places to eat due to the high volume of food service workers they had to deny #coronavirus testing to against their better judgement because they weren‚Äôt likely to die.
please, reach out to a service industry worker you know and let them know how valued they are. offer to have them over for dinner. send them a tip. send them job recommendations. service industry folks have always shown up for us; now, show up for them. #COVID19

I have developed a dry cough with a bronchial burn.  No other symptoms besides post nasal drip. Should I call the doc or ride it out? I live in a corona hot spot. I don‚Äôt want to go to the doctors if i don‚Äôt have to. #coronavirus
All myths that Coronavirus will go away in Summer months. 		Wrong. Previous pandemics didn‚Äôt follow weather patterns plus as we enter summer, there will be winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Virus is global.		#CoronavirusOutbreak
What is LA doing about all those homeless folks now that we have the #coronavirus outbreak?
The mayor of Greenville, South Carolina is following in NC Gov. Roy Cooper‚Äôs footsteps by banning all restaurants, bars &amp; breweries from serving food and drinks on-site. Instead, businesses can offer delivery, drive-thru and to-go options. #coronavirus
Thought I'd share this quote from Leia in the last #StarWars film. I think it's what we should all do in these troubling times. Take care, stay safe and:		Do me a favour, and be optimistic! #KeepCalmAndCarrieOn #CarrieFisher #COVID19 #keepcalmandcarryon
This #CoronavirusPandemic is getting out of control! Every place is closed! Libraries, banks, Restraunts you name it.
STAY HOME #COVID19
People who earn and nurture their families on daily basis are suffering a lot. 	#CoronaVirus
An important factor with the #coronavirus  pandemic is Time. How long before the majority of the population gets infected? How long before there is a vaccine or cure? How long before it #mutates to a deadlier strain? How long will we be In isolation?
All it takes is for one teacher or student to have #coronavirus and they don‚Äôt need to be a #superspreader but my guess is it would be super spreading in a school!
Working from home for this week at least. Our very sensible company is phasing us out of the office to reduce risks to ours and others‚Äô health. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª #HomeOffice #KeepingSafe #COVID19
Mark my words, Grocery stores will the epicenter of the next outbreak. Nobody is listening or doing anything to help us.	And we are running out of food.	#CoronavirusOutbreak
someone should set up a pay it forward scheme so we can look after the elderly. #COVID19
First time my former Gov is making sense. I hope it is not rhetoric, I pray he sticks with this new path of all loving and accepting he is human n  make mistakes too. Nigeria need everyone to be focused now and fight our common enemies #Poverty #insurgency #CoronavirusOutbreak

You know what? It‚Äôs okay to be scared. This is a scary time. We have never seen something like this before. The virus is scary. The economy is scary. The way people are acting is scary. Don‚Äôt let anyone make you feel bad for being scared of what‚Äôs going on right now. #coronavirus
First of all, we need to stop putting a time line on this virus as if someone is controlling it. YOU CAN RECOVER FASTER if you stay home and and STOP SPREADING IT. I understand the struggle, we all have bills and have to eat. STOP PANICKING #COVID19 #coronapocolypse
final thoughts for today on #coronavirus is assume it‚Äôs on everything and that everyone has it. It‚Äôs almost impossible to not touch stuff between hand hygiene and eating as an example. Maintain 2 metres between everyone and stop being self conscious about reminding people as much
Living with someone who goes on with things same as usual with #COVID19. Doesn't get what that means for me if I'm infected. I'm all anger and sadness right now. So much sadness. Bad enough most of the symptoms are similar to what I already live with. #chronicillness #fibro
Reminder: STAY THE FUCK HOME MEANS NO SOCIAL GATHERINGS!!!!  ASYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE ARE SPREADING THE VIRUS TOO! #Covid_19 #COVID2019 #StayHomeSaveLives #StayTheFHome

I feel like the United States' response to this pandemic was: plugging its ears, closing its eyes, and yelling "lalalala". And then this week, the United States finally opened its eyes and was like "shoot, that usually works. There goes plan A, B, and C!" #coronavirus #COVID19

I‚Äôm glad the fed gov‚Äôt is working on a stimulus, but workers who are laid off and ineligible for unemployment are going to need more than $1,000 to weather this. We are talking months here, not weeks. #COVID19 #coronavirus
