We  need to unite as a world to fight against this #CoronaVirus
In these times, selfishness becomes a form of selflessness. #coronavirus
We live in a really shit time right now. Individualism is everything. It shouldn't be. Those with the means have stockpiled the essentials. Those who go from pay check to pay check are finding empty shelves. I really fear for the most vulnerable in society right now. #coronavirus
Bout to let myself have an epic #hemiplegicmigraine and end it all before I inevitably get the #coronavirus when the hospitals are overloaded and they prioritize a healthy person over me anyway 😵💀
Are people actually stupid for going on vacation during #CoronaCrisis, you are basically paying to go on holiday for lockdown lol 😂 Thank the Lord i’m not in Spain right now! #CoronavirusOutbreak
This is why public healthcare is so important. Health affects us all. People are going to go bankrupt getting treatment for #COVID19. Some people will not get treated for fear of the cost, and instead will infect others. #Medicare4All
All the protests must be stopped for the precautions. 	We know that you all are brave. But this government is in no mood to listen to you. 		So for the safety of your family and friends you must stop.  	#CoronaVirus
We must manage this pandemic with ‘wartime’ style leadership. Please everybody, follow the advice of the experts, have respect for authority and KEEP WASHING YOUR HANDS #covid19UK #coronavirus
Something important to remember here is that OF COURSE confirmed cases are going to spike now that more and more people are being tested and results are coming in. Negative tests are also increasing exponentially. Numbers do not necessarily equal overnight spread. #coronavirus
Stay Safe Stay Strong	#COVID19
Great to see over due light shone on important sectors of Irish (&amp; Global) society during the #coronavirus outbreak. 		Heroes		-Nurses &amp; Doctors (inc retired ones coming back to help)		-Grocery sector workers - shelf stockers &amp; check out staff 		-The Gardaí		👨🏻‍⚕️👩🏼‍⚕️👮‍♂️👮‍♀️☘️		#ourbest
#selfquarantine and #MartialLaw is the only way at current to extremely slow the #coronavirus ....whats your thoughts?
Cases have been reported in neighbing countries - Ghana, Benin Republic, Cameroon. Others are Liberia, Burkina Faso.	If we don't have the right equipment at the land &amp; sea borders, shut them.	#coronavirus 	#CoronaVirusNigeria 	#CoronaVirusLagos
I can’t wait for things to get back to normal, this whole #CoronavirusOutbreak is getting crazy. I hope everyone is staying safe during these dark times, sending my love and thoughts.
