We will all eventually be infected with #COVID19, short of having a vaccine available. The point is to decrease the rate of spread, and avoid exposing those most vulnerable. That‚Äôs what #FlattenTheCurve means, and why #PPENow for healthcare workers is an absolute necessity.
I'm watching the news: they're juxtaposing footage of Mayor Garcetti &amp; Gov. Newsome (asking people to stay indoors) with footage of CROWDS of people playing soccer at a park and another group skating in Venice. I am beyond furious with the selfish people. #COVID19 #StayHome
My wife and Sam are now staying at her grandads house for a while to keep away from me. 	Being ill and alone is going to be a horrible combo üòî	Miss them already.	#COVID19 #coronavirus #cysticfibrosis

It‚Äôs hard for the self-employed and daily-paid to self-isolate. What will they eat? The government needs to reach out to the people and help those in dire need. #COVID19

I don't understand the point of shutting all these different places down for 14 days, when there is still a lot of places open. They need to shut everything down  besides grocery stores, drugstores, gas stations, and the LCBO so the ladies can get their wine! #COVID19
Dr. Devi Shetty on CNBC interview says there will be at least 80000 positive cases in Karnataka alone in next 10-12 days. If we aren‚Äôt serious about Social Distancing then we are fucked. #CoronavirusLockdown #CoronavirusPandemic
