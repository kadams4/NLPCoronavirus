People are worried about #CoronavirusOutbreak when there‚Äôs people being abducted by aliens and getting sacrificed to the Illuminati üõ∏üî•
So I guess, in/by November, Trump will declare a national emergency and close all the polls, putting off the presidential election *indefinitely*. 		It‚Äôll be his way of profiting off of COVID-19. ü§Ø		#CoronavirusPandemic #Trumpdemic
We are literally all playing a game of Plauge Inc. rn #COVID19

Dear EVERYONE in the media, unless you are an EXPERT on the coronavirus, this is what we want to hear from you. "I don't know anything in regards to the coronavirus, so I'm going to talk about ________, and leave that to the experts."	#CoronavirusPandemic 	#sensationalism
So I don't have a problem with #WuFlu, #wuhancoronvirus, #ChinaFlu etc tags for the #COVID19 virus as a descriptor.	I don't recall the #Spanish bitching and moaning for the last 100+ years about the #SpanishFlu, so perhaps neither should #China and people claiming #Sinophobia üôÑ
We should build a #Covid_19 wall ü§™
