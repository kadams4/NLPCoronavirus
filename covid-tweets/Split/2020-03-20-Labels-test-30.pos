If anything I canâ€™t wait for those #SpringBreakers in #florida to get sunburn lines of their masks.		Fuck people chilling at the beach, they should be arrested.		#SpringBreak #MiamiSpringBreak #CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19
Our forefathers went on a war. All we have to do is stay inside the house to save ourselves and the world! 	Just stay inside. #CoronavirusOutbreak #FightCOVID19 #GoCoronaCoronaGo
Can we just shut down the country for 2-3 weeks so everybody can get their normal lives back please. I miss my girlfriend and my friends very much #Covid_19 #coronavirus
The middle of a global pandemic is a greatttttt time for my baby to realize she can stick her hands in her mouth. #coronavirus
Donâ€™t go to Bar 		Donâ€™t come out of your homes	 	Donâ€™t go to cinema 		Donâ€™t go parties 		PM Modi may be starting to sound like your partner, but believe me this is serious and he's saying it for your benefit. INDIA please stay at home. #coronavirus
Social distancing slows down the spread of COVID-19. This is the overwhelming consensus among public health practitioners. 		#COVID19 		#CloseTheMosques		#EastleighMosques
Boris: work from home if at all possible		Work official statement: work from home with line manager permission		Me: Hey line manager can I work from home please, I have asthma and I don't want to catch CoronaVirus		Line manager: that makes sense, but no ...		#CoronaVirus
I think we should use loud speakers of all Mosques/Temples to spread awareness regarding COVID19. This is least we can do to inform the masses that are still unaware of the basic DO's and DONT's.		#COVID #covid19 #coronavirus
Even when it feels close, the pandemic wonâ€™t really hit us until we lose somebody we love. At that point, all our opinions about it will take a different perspective. Some have died alone #COVID19
Iâ€™m genuinely scared of going to my job next week to which I absolutely love, all cause of this virus going around, I do not stop, I am a support worker, people still need to be cared for. If our country goes into lock down, no doubt Iâ€™ll still have to work ðŸ™„ #COVID19
Key worker sends kids to school. Kids mix and spread #coronavirus among themselves and staff. Kids return home and infect key worker parents. Key workers self isolate. How does this help?
#Pakistan must declare a state of #emergency before the #coronavirus situation gets out of control.
Is there anything that us, the healthy Americans with no symptoms, can do for our country in this time of need? Get us working now! #COVID19 #coronapocolypse #helpingothers
WE , EACH ONE OF US, are all 	FIRST RESPONDERS in the #Covid_19 #pandemic .		The FIRST response, the FIRST life saving measure is #SocialDistancingNow MUST be the #FirstResponse
#coronavirus ðŸ¦ is everywhere. Stay safe, stay home.   We'll beat this, we have dealt with worse.
Healthcare professionals donâ€™t scare easily. Everyday, we see illness do unimaginable things to people. And then, at the end of the day we go home, kick off our shoes, and watch some Netflix. We donâ€™t scare easily. And #COVID19 scares the hell out of us. So take it seriously.
I think the only way to stop #Covid_19 right now is #CompleteLockdown. 	Yes i fear, i worry ðŸ˜¥.		Don't agree with #PMImranKhan, sorryðŸ˜ž.		#CoronaVirusPakistan	#CoronavirusPandemic	#CoronaVirusUpdate
Occured to me today that ALL the emails I receive now end with 'stay safe' or 'keep safe' and this has genuinely never felt more real to me than it does now. #staysafe #COVID19 #keepsafe
