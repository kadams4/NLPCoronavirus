Brothers and sisters, now I confirmed organised church is a #SCAM. My local posted accounts numbers for offerings &amp; tithes during this period.	My question was, if the #church as a body of Christ is doing anythg to help members, local communities &amp; frontliners in regards #covid19
Since the beginning, experts have stated the United States was roughly 10 days behind Italy. If this still holds true, we are in for a rough couple weeks. We need leadership and understanding. We need, honestly, some civility and empathy. We just need to be better. #Coronavirus
letting ur kid run the obstacle course at ur apartments dog park to wear off that extra energy 😅 #COVID19
It’s literally the time to eat the rich #coronavirus out here telling us to donate when half of us dont even have jobs any more GET A CLUE CELEBRITIES
It was bad enough that we got senator's selling stock on inside #COVID19 info. Now the government wants to send checks to everyone except the ones who really need it. #politicians and the government are true SCUMBAGS this will be my last tweet
I hope Trump’s apathy and incompetence in handling #Covid_19 leads to thousands of lawsuits. He deserves it.
Just want to point something out: While more news outlets are getting more clicks (even while ad revenue is slipping), many of those same outlets are making vital #COVID19 coverage free. Pretty selfless, isn’t it? #SupportYourLocalNewspaper
WHAT A JOKE! the Senate's bill still has $25 million for the Kennedy Center. What a relief to the small businesses going under because of #COVID19.
The entire humanity should isolate china, "they are the virus". No one should have trade relationships with them. They should be taught a lesson.	#IsolateChina	#ChinaVirus	#Covid19	#coronavirus
And while I was already not making a liveable wage at my job, now they are cutting hours as if it wasn’t already impossible to support myself while working 45 hours a week. #coronavirus #Quarantine #CorporateGreed #endrant

#WorldNewsTonight on 3/25 reported 46% of #coronavirus deaths in NY were 18-44 years old and 54% were age 75+. That’s 100%. So 0% age 44-74?? Please confirm.
#coronavirus is affecting each one of us differently, but it is affecting each one of us. Please be kind
I just want to get a hazmat suit and take my camera to Europe. Take pics of all those beautiful places right now that it’s empty.	#CoronavirusLockdown #QuarantineLife #COVID19 #Travel
If I get one more email from a company that I already pay online due to #COVID19....🤬🤬

What are the Constitutional implications of suspending all criminal jury trials in the wake of #COVID19? Are the accused just sitting in jail indefinitely awaiting trial? Is there a provision that allows the courts to force them to wait because of a crisis? #QTNA
Awesome! Two really amazing photographs that I’m really proud of have been excepted into a gallery show! 		Bummer. That show is now totally up in the air and will most likely be postponed or just canceled all together. 		🤷‍♂️	#TheNewNormal #COVID19 #photographyislife
Every day keeps getting more weird. Everyone out running in jeans earlier today: I see you. #COVID19
Weeks ago, we were sending our Chinese friends our best thoughts and wishing them safety and health as they worked from home during the partial factory shutdown. They're back at work, and wish the same for us. There is a sense that we're all in this together. #coronavirus
I am absolutely, completely, and utterly sick of every company, entity, group, organization, and agency I've ever had email contact with sending me a coronavirus update, how they're handling things, etc. Leave me the hell alone. #COVID19

If Trump supporters are so convinced he's doing a wonderful job:		How do they explain why so many medical personnel don't have enough PPE?		Why can't they explain why Trump said there's no problem for 2 months? 		Or why he then said he knew there was a problem long ago?		#COVID19

So since we’re on track to beat China in the number of #Coronavirus cases, are we going to start calling it the American Virus anytime soon?

Scared about losing your insurance if you get laid off because of the #coronavirus pandemic? Relax! There's a law called COBRA that lets you pay even more for the same insurance while you're unemployed and not making money. It's a beautiful thing!
Trump calling this the ‘Chinese Virus’. All he’s trying to do is denounce China, to give it a stigma so that the USA will be the superpower. Dangerous game. Dangerous game. 	#coronavirus
This novel #coronavirus is twice as infectious as flu and 15 times more likely to land you in the hospital.
