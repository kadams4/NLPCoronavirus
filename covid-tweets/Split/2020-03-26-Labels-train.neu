I hope Trump‚Äôs apathy and incompetence in handling #Covid_19 leads to thousands of lawsuits. He deserves it.
Just want to point something out: While more news outlets are getting more clicks (even while ad revenue is slipping), many of those same outlets are making vital #COVID19 coverage free. Pretty selfless, isn‚Äôt it? #SupportYourLocalNewspaper
WHAT A JOKE! the Senate's bill still has $25 million for the Kennedy Center. What a relief to the small businesses going under because of #COVID19.

If Trump supporters are so convinced he's doing a wonderful job:		How do they explain why so many medical personnel don't have enough PPE?		Why can't they explain why Trump said there's no problem for 2 months? 		Or why he then said he knew there was a problem long ago?		#COVID19
