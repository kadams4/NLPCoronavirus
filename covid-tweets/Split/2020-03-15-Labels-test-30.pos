With as horrible as my immune system is, and how long I stay sick just from strep throat or a cold, I probably wouldn't survive getting the #coronavirus 	Please wash your fucking hands and stay home when you can.
#GoodVibes day 1: remember to thank all the cashiers and workers restocking shelves at the supermarket.. the working class people who keep on showing up (no paid sick leave) and who despite everything make us feel slightly more secure by keeping shops open #COVID19
The Army Corp of Engineers needs to start building emergency temporary hospitals today for the #coronavirus surge we are going to see in 4-6 weeks. We canâ€™t let our hospitals become overwhelmed. #flatteningthecurve
I'm actually comforted by the rising number of people diagnosed with #COVIDãƒ¼19. This means that people are being tested. 		REMEMBER: There are 10-25x more people WITH #coronavirus than what has been reported. Now it's about finding out who has it.
I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been more disappointed in people my age. Your spring break vacation isnâ€™t worth it, stay home, itâ€™s what we owe each other. #COVID19
Like many others who decided to close today because of #COVID19 I debated with myself back &amp; forth for days. As difficult as it was Iâ€™m so glad now that I did it Iâ€™ll sleep a bit easier tonight. Do the right thing for everyone #closethepubs #closetherestaurants #LockdownIreland

Stockpiling is feeding into the alarmist trend and youâ€™re also infecting others around you- Fear is very infectious. Have common sense and brush up on your etiquettes, be wary but also know that actually quarantining yourself on such short notice is virtually impossible. #COVID19
