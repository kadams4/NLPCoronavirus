We are also on the brink of running out of large volume pumps for medication infusions. Our bed capacity has been increased by 50% and everyone from the front lines &amp; those behind the scenes are exhausted. Please stay home if you can #CoronaVirus #COVID19

Global #CoronaVirus cases: 		1 to 1,00,000 cases: 67 days		1,00,000 to 2,00,000 cases: 11 days.		2,00,000 to 3,00,000 cases: 4 days.		3,00,000 to 4,00,000 cases: 3 days.		4,00,000 to 5,00,000 cases: 2 days.		Stay at home.
The reason we are having an explosion of cases is because people like my best friend, my two brothers and millions of other people in the Trump and Fox News cult are saying this is overblown. #COVID19  #coronavirus #Quarantine
Once we flatten the curve, people will loose that awareness of basic measures to protect themselves like washing hands, keeping distance, etc and this will result in another curve just like what Britain is experiencing.	#COVID19
#BREAKING DHSS has announced the second #COVID19 death for Delaware, an 86-year-old man in a Newark nursing home who had underlying medical conditions.
I agree with the #RiversState Govt &amp; other states that have taken this route. The next step should be a two or three week #StayAtHome order. Emergency equipment &amp; supplies will be let in under strict control as is done worldwide. 	#LockdownNigeriaNow #COVID19 #SocialDistancing
We literally have more cases than Italy and they lost 800 people IN ONE DAY!!! #ShutDownUSA  #Coronavirus
I’m tempted to just go drive around and park and sit in the parking lots of stores and watch YouTube videos of people shopping in those stores... #COVID19 #QuarantineLife
COVID-19 was named that because we’re all going to gain 19 lbs from sheltering in place at home. #CoronavirusOubreak #CoronaVillains #COVID2019 #StayHomeSA #coronavirus
I clicked on the Sport section of my online news portal. What was your most desperate move today? 🤦‍♀️ #StayHome #workremotely #COVID19 #WashYourHands
Stuck at home or Safe at home ?	Mindset matters ! 	#coronavirus
My work is all over the place. As is my family. Everyone is hit in their own way. My daughter asks me when this will end. I thank my stars she hasn’t asked me how this will end. I have resolved to stay positive. #coronavirus #CoronavirusLockdown
Day 10		Just stay at home! 		#KawalanPerintahPergerakan #DudukRumah #StayAtHome #StaySafeStayHome #Covid19 #COVID19malaysia  #PrayForMalaysia
I don’t know if my mental health can survive this quarantine/social distancing. #COVID19
Thanks to the front line health care workers sacrificing their lives to save ours !👏#hcwshoutout #COVID19 #StayHomeSaveLives
I want desperately to be able to DO something to stop #COVID19 . It's so frustrating that the best way to help is to just stay home.
People doing push ups and getting ripped in prison is so real y’all I be doing push ups for no reason these days??? But I’m not getting ripped cause I also be eating for no reason these days #COVID19 #QuarantineLife
If there was ever a time for a drive-in movie resurgence, it’s now! If we can go through a drive-thru for food, we can go to the drive-in for a movie #COVID19
The USA now has more #COVID19 cases than any other country, despite the fact that in most states getting tested is still extremely difficult. The real number of cases is so much higher...		Why aren’t we all in lockdown?? This is beyond ridiculous and irresponsible. #LockdownUSA
In a rogue #coronavirus #StayTheFHome move I decided to stay home and touch my face! #IsolationLife #haventbeenoutsideindays
The United States now have more positive #COVID19 cases than any other country in the world. More than 82,000 cases and over 1100 deaths from it.  Remember that's only the people that have been tested. There are many more that are untested. #StayHome
When quarantine life gets you bored and you start to wacth ww2 documentaries #ChineseVirus19 #CoronavirusOubreak #StayHome #Coronavirus
Honestly what I get from the daily #COVID19 briefings is: because Americans basically cannot understand.  This is a bad bad bad flu.  Sir your ass in your house.  And lock the Gd Door.
Hi, all, there's still hope 😁 One step closer to solving mystery of #covid19 patient zero. There are more than thousand hundred people infected &amp; thousand dozen people's deaths. People deserve the truth about #coronavirus. Stay at home, stay healthy, and stay safe #Anonymous
Prayers for each country, each individual and families tonight. Stay safe, practice safety. Sending out energy, light and love	#CornavirusOutbreak #COVID2019 #StayHomeStaySafeSavelives #coronavirus

And while we're at it, stay away from grocers, bankers, and whomever else is still open if you're sick. Because we can't afford to get sick either, and just because you're sick that doesn't mean it's okay to fuck with us. Eat shit if you do.	#COVID 	#coronavirus	#lockdown
But my 74-year-old uncle, had a scheduled, non-emergent surgery today. This took a person from a high-risk group, out of his safe home, to a high-risk place, using a bed, further overworking the already overburdened staff, and requiring the use of precious PPE.		#COVID19 🦠
Our country, our world is under attack!!! And  #COVID19 is our enemy 		Stay at home!!! You could be saving someone’s life. Look around you, it’s  all up to you. We’re all counting on you to do the right thing!
How about lockdown by phone number. Or ID number 	For instance: cell/ID numbers that end with 1-3 get one day to shop etc	Permission is via SMS, one line per person. The tech exists #CurfewinKenya #COVID19
Ok guys. We have passed up #China &amp; #Itally in #COVID19  cases. Get with the program and #SocialDistanacing #StayHomeSaveLives #staysafe
Today the US was named the country with the most confirmed #COVID19 cases in the world. And there are still way too many American people who don't get that this is serious. It defies logic.
Y'all this Corona virus got y'all acting like selfish fools!  Can't even find rubbing alcohol!🤦 Stock piling everything and I bet you fools are still out and about in the public! 🙄🙄 #annoyed #overit #COVID19
Stay at home: Remain inside as much as possible and only leave for essential activities. 	Shelter in place: Unable to leave; on lockdown. 	Know the difference, don’t listen to rumors. #COVID19
The hardest part of this virus is the fact that I live with roommates who don’t take isolation seriously and I can’t afford my own place. Is anyone else dealing with this?? #coronavirus
All y’all people having Quarantine parties ,I’m telling the authorities that it’s more then seven people over🤷🏽‍♀️	#Quarantine #SocialDistanacing #coronavirus
This #coronavirus is very serious man.. the fact we ain’t taking it serious.. is scary.

At the current time the #UK is still in full exponential growth of #COVID19. However it locked down so in 2 weeks it will begin to slow. Please, all people worldwide, please enter full lockdown. If we ignore lockdown, we will have at least 20% mortality, 38% next year.#extinction
I still work. Going to this wedding puts me and everyone around me at risk. This hurts so badly because the one time they want me to be there for them....I can’t go. I won’t be able to work. I can get others sick. It’s tearing me apart. #coronavirus #covid19 #wedding #lockdown
IF YOU DECIDE TO GO OUT, AND YOU GET INFECTED, YOU WILL PROPAGATE A CHAIN OF INFECTION THAT ULTIMATELY KILLS 9 PEOPLE. How is this message not being delivered more clearly? #coronavirus #coronavirusaustralia
so it is very important to stay home and not relate to nobody, being very careful is very important and very crucial. From March 23 to April 3 we must take care of ourselves as we will be at the peak of the virus, two weeks, 2/ #COVID19 #ukcoronavirus #UKlockdown
We all have a national tragedy we remember from our childhood...I'm sad my children have this to remember. Having to explain to them why they can't go to the fence to say hi to the neighbors really blows! #coronavirus #SocialDistancing
my parents are getting a quarantine korgi.  but i cant go see it because of self-isolating. a new hatred for #coronavirus was born today.
Also, to those idiots who refused to stay home for spring break bc you planned it for so long, I don’t feel sorry for any of you. At this point, that’s just natural selection. #COVID19 #SocialDistanacing #CongratulationsAmerica #springbreakidiots #dontlistentotrump #StayTheFHome
Once it goes out it sells out fast. This is like Black Friday. Just please social distance. Go only for the essential items and please don't browse around cause your bored.	The virus is very serious and we need to get ahead of it 3/3	#coronavirus #SocialDistanacing #StayHome
Also to anyone chasing, use your head Saturday. With everything going on with #COVID19 and the possibility of this being a bigger day, I expect a lot of people to be out. Don’t gather in large groups and continue to social distance.
Can y'all please just follow the government instructions so we can knock this coronavirus out and be done? I feel like a kindergartner that keeps loosing more recess time because one or two kids can't follow directions. 🙄😞 #COVID2019 #COVID19 #StayHome
In New York City alone, there are over 300 members of the police force with COVID-19. Hundreds more are waiting for tests reports NBC #FirstResponders #covid #coronavirus #stayathome #SocialDistanacing

Tonight, I had to censor somebody from my life. Which is okay, because he is really dumb and doesn't think Covid-19 is real.		#fernandoaponte #coronavirus #covid19 #unitedstates #tennessee #nashville #nashvilletn #popmusic #instagay #lisaney #usnews #Tennessee #unitedstates
The last few days have been the first days in more than a month that I’ve seen increases of less than 30% in the number of cases counted.  #stayinplace #shelterinplace #covid_19 #staysafe #beatthevirus #beatthecoronavirus

A couple of sobering facts:		1) If you die of COVID-19, you die alone with carers dressed in spacesuits! 		2) You get buried in your pyjamas or your hospital robes! 		3) Healthy, young people are NOT immune!		Now STAY THE FUCK INSIDE!! #coronavirus #StayHomeSaveLives
3) But he can only do that if the public will stop needlessly putting themselves &amp; others at risk. 	#flattenthecurve #wenotme #COVID19 #StayHomeSaveLives
