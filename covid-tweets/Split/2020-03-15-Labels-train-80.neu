As the daughter of a man who makes cleaning and disinfectant products for a living, #coronavirus has actually been fairy positive for us
I’m seeing a lot of academics on #ScienceTwitter retweeting accounts that spread Chinese propaganda. We need to be careful, remember that half the reason the world is infected is because one brave soul revealed a virus that the chinese government was trying to hide. #coronavirus

This pandemic is actually bringing the worst out of us. Fighting over toilet papers, increase in the price of sanitisers, and unavailability of masks shows how civilised we are. Moralities my ***. #coronavirus #coronavirusoutbreak
Please note that we must prioritize these drive thru PODs and let elderlies and individuals with Pre-existing conditions to go in line first as they need it the most. Please call your doctor before showing up to a #covid_19 POD site
This morning, I read that the cause of the Covid-19 outbreak is thought to have originated possibly from illegal sales of pangolin, a scaly anteater which is prized in China for its use in traditional medicine. How ridiculously ironic. 😡 #COVID19 #coronavirus #coronavirusuk
Never thought I would see the day where I’m asking myself what I will do with a Saturday not physio’n at the football 😂 #coronavirus

Can people, like, not spit on the street/in public? Is there some weird, involuntary reflex I’m not aware of??	#COVID19
When I’m 500 lbs I blame #coronavirus because when I’m sitting at home, all I wanna do is eat snacks....

Can Pence stop bragging about the "unprecedented public/private partnerships!" that are carrying out the testing. Yeah we know, companies are going to make a shitload of taxpayer money due to this virus. Great job assholes	#COVIDー19 #coronavirus
People are running around buying up TP and hand sanitizer and I just want to snatch up my favorite foods at my favorite restaurants before they shut down. #coronavirus
The Dutch have closed their sex shops. 	This is really starting to hit home now.	#coronavirus
I think it’s odd that the people who are not at all happy with the government’s response to the #CoronavirusOutbreak  want the same government in charge of our healthcare all the time. #BernieSanders  #Biden2020
Why are people stock piling bottled water?! Is #coronavirus attacking our taps too?! 😱

My boyfriend was due to start a new job on Monday and so he quit his current one. They have now told him that they are letting him go because of coronavirus so now he is unemployed and has no idea where or when he will get work #coronavirus
Sarve santhu niramaya		May all be without illness.		#COVID19	#Corona
Trying to protect Boomer relatives from #COVID19 is like trying to help an injured animal: You're in constant danger of being attacked because they don't understand that you're just trying to help them...
A couple thoughts on screenings:	1. While in Italy I was not concerned about #COVID19. I was concerned when we got on the plane and had no room to move. I went to the restroom after some lady that was coughing and had to use my elbows to operate everything (not that it helps).
We fight because we are worth fighting for and we never stop fighting. #COVID19 #covid19kenya #COVID19Nigeria #SundayMorning
