Watching tv right now is so weird. The ads were made b4 #Covid_19 and are pushing trips to Vegas and selling things that are so not necessary... not that they really ever were b4. But still, it's super surreal.
I have called an emergency meeting tomorrow of all head of the departments of PIMS to address all the important issues being faced by the medical staff &amp; patients. Safety of health workforce is my first priority while responding to #coronavirus &lt;265&gt;
In self isolation as 2 of us now have symptoms but we need to search various stores to find stuff for dinner. If people didn't panic buy, we could go to 1 shop. But since those scum r buying all the food, we have to travel farther each time. Fuck u all. #stockpilingUK #Covid_19
Let us unite in this fight against #Covid19 pandemic.		#IndiaFightsCorona #WeSupportJanataCurfew
God pls come through for all European countries suffering this crisis(🦠) . Save us all 🙏🙏😢 #prayforitalia #Covid_19 #CoronaCrisis
Gotta shift our focus, IMHO*.		Less concern about getting #coronavirus test and more about following orders to #socialdistance and #stayhome. Test doesn’t cure. Assume everyone has it.		Social distancing and good hygiene are the spoonful of medicine we need.		*I’m not a doctor
A lot of people returning to Canada this weekend left last weekend when they knew the full scope of this #Covid_19 situation. 	These people feel invincible. 	The likelihood that we get good self isolation compliance from them is low.
At a time like this, cigarette companies should be the ones running campaigns telling people to stop smoking that shit because y'all need your lungs because Corona attacks your lungs basically. Without the ability to breathe, you're dead. Anyone? #Covid_19 #Covid19InSA
I am incredibly proud of my radiographer son working for the #NHS please protect yourselves to help me protect my boy. #Covid_19 #StaySafeStayHome #radiographer
It is duty of all citizens to educate population not to move not to #travel as news are coming that many people are moving back to there hometowns . If we stay indoor we can win #CoronaVirus
Observations: Older / at risk not getting the message. Couples walking round Tesco, too close to everyone. No concept of keeping back at counters or tills. And bizarrely, parents with children going shopping? Why? Lock the country down, some people can't be educated  #Covid_19
As the saying goes, Prevention is better than cure, sadly there is no cure available for #CoronaVirus so we are only left with prevention.		So please take serious preventive measures and stay safe !!		#CoronaVirusPakistan
I’m seven weeks pregnant and completely anxious about this virus. I’ve been staying inside my house for the past six days. Avoiding everyone but my husband. 😬 #Covid_19
Question. Can pubs stay open if they are moving their tables outside and allowing people to buy food/ drink and eat it outside????? I've just seen this happening... surely not?!?!?! #COVID19  #CoronaCrisisuk #pubsclosed
Section 144 imposed in District Srinagar. Cooperate. It’s for your own safety, the safety of your loved ones. Stay home. Stay safe. 		#Covid19
Along with exercising the necessary precautions, let’s pledge to drive our positive thoughts to eradicate this #coronavirus. There’s no harm in doing it. Let’s stop spreading the news with negativity, think positively that our world is free of this #coronavirus
Peoples inability to distance themselves socially is absolutely mind blowing. Temporarily isolating ourselves could mean all this being over in time for the summer. Thousands of life's saved. Surely people can go a few weeks chilling in the gaff 🤦‍♂️ #Covid_19
Thanks to #AmazonPrime and #Netflix which give lots of different things to enjoy in such situation.. A very nice solution to fight with #Covid_19.. Enjoy the shows, stay at home, stay healthy and stay safe.
#italystaystrongCorona seeing  what Italy is going through I feel 💔,. People dying like insects😭😭😭. Our help comes from the Lord The creator of Heaven and Earth. Our sincere prayers are with you italians	#PrayForItaly #Covid_19	#ItalyCoronaVirus
It still amazes me the stupidity of human beings !	Open your eyes folks people are dying, do what your told by the government and do your bit to help the country through this pandemic. Its not much to ask really 🇬🇧 ! #Covid_19 #covid19UK #covid19scotland
My opposite neighbours family &amp; their kids have been together the last 2 days with all kids playing outside together my next door neighbour had construction people over since 6:30am, am I really surrounded by dumb people lack of seriousness #SocialDistance #SelfIsolation #COVID19
Any tips on how to get my over 60 mum with type 1 diabetes, to take this shit seriously because she couldn’t give less fucks if she tried. #CoronavirusPandemic
Having to modify some games we play with our toddler. 		This little piggy? Yeah, all of those toes are staying home. #covid19
#Covid19 कोरोना को मज़ाक में ना ले ।।  as possible stay at home ..	And follow all medical and government instructions carefully..		Keep safe yourself with  your family and friends..😷😷🙏🙏	#CoronaStopKaroNa  #CoronavirusOutbreakindia
I don’t understand if you are picking up food to go you have to bring the entire family AND walk into the restaurant holding hands. Having an absolute panic right now. #Covid_19 #coronavirus
Having two people in the house at Hugh risk is sending me into a constant panic. #covid19
People who are still going out and socialising and ignoring the safe distancing will have blood on their hands when the #Covid_19 has killed someone you know. Simple. #StayIn
So the situation is getting scarry... Hope everyone is taking care of their family, friends and themselves..	#COVID19
Am at some place near Eldoret town and I can confirm that here people are serious about #COVID19 ... You can't visit any premise without washing your hands first. Really commendable
Keep safe everyone. Let's pray for one another in this trying time. 🙏🙏🙏	#COVID19	#StayAtHome
Your life is not something that someone gives you, but something you choose yourself...so be at home as long as you can and be safe ....	#StaySafeStayHome 	#Covid_19 	#lockdownknockdown
#CoronavirusPandemic 	I think Gov.DeWine has waited too long to shut down the city. 159 yesterday, 247 today and how many more before the end of the day?
At this point it should now be obvious how stupid it is to attach #Healthcare to #Employment or behind a paywall. 		#CoronavirusPandemic #COVIDー19 #COVID19 #MedicareForAll #M4A
1/ Life in the time of #COVID19: a #medtwitter perspective from the frontlines (week 1)	👉🏻virus doesn’t age discriminate	👉🏻young/healthy people doing better	👉🏻immunosuppressed or comorbid patients all went to #ICU 	👉🏻silent hypoxemia is real
#Covid19 virus has an R0 of 6.6. Meaning that on average one infected  person could go on to infect atleast 6.6 other people. This can only be reduced by social distancing and self isolation. #Salonetwitter, please avoid crowded locations until the pandemic ends. Do am for Salone
If you're not worried, you're not paying attention.#Covid_19
It’s a massacre in Italy among the elderly born before 1940. They were kids playing when the bombs were falling during the war, the ones that built our Republic. We need to find a way to protect them. Other countries should do the same to shield that precious generation #COVID19
Community spread has already started since a week. Refusal by Indian Govt  just because it "tracked" active #covid19 patients isn't going to prove the fact that there is no community spread.
Get the fuck out of my face , coming in here and possibly being infected! #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirus #workplace
This virus has seriously shown me who would die first in a zombie apocalypse some of you are dumb🙃🙃🙃 #CoronavirusInSouthAfrica #Covid_19
There's too many "ahh fuck it, it's only a cold" people in this country 😔🇬🇧		#StayAtHome #Covid_19 #CoronaCrisis #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic
Doctors can be your caretakers and curer, but also a potential spreader of the virus unless they are protected enough. Provide them with the protective kits already!! 	#lockdownpakistan 	#CoronavirusPandemic 	#StayHomeStaySafe
Even, people should also follow the basic guidelines from government without any need of strict punishment. But as currently, only requests/ guidelines are not enough. Hence a strict process must be implemented quickly to quarantine people.	#WuhanVirus #CoronavirusPandemic
JUST NO!!		azithromycin is for BACTERIA! #coronavirus is a VIRUS this drug WILL NOT WORK ON A VIRUS		hydroxychloroquine (aka plaquenil) is NOT approved for #coronavirus - it's in an experimental phase for #coronavirus &amp; only certain people can tolerate it
J &amp; I hopped in the car to get out of the house and just drive around. I am honestly shocked, and truly disappointed to see how many people are still out. Target, sure. But Best Buy and Hobby Lobby?! WHY?!! People need to wake up and take this serious. 😷🦠#StayHome #coronavirus
Now Its Like...	Divided We Stand	United We Fall	#CoronavirusPandemic	#StayAtHome 	#Covid_19
I had to get the fuck out of there as quick as possible. A man coughed all over the self checkout machine which made me turn my ass around and stand in a long ass line for regular checkout. People were wearing gas masks y’all! I’m like where they get that shit from? #Covid_19
Don't go out side please #coronavirus
If anyone traveling out of the city to their Village/Native stay yourself as quarantine at least a week. So it won't spread in Villages		#CoronaStopKaroNa #CoronavirusOutbreakindia #COVID2019uk #Covid19India #CoronaCrisis #CoronavirusOutbreak
If Britain were ever pressed once more into war, a week ago I'd have given our chances of success at no more than 40%. 	But seeing how our great nation mobilised to the PM's rallying cry of 'the pubs are shutting' restored any lost faith I had. Take that, beer isle!!	#Covid_19
Having spoken to and read accounts from varying healthcare professionals in various places, it's clear that what our leadership is telling us is and will be happening is not the reality of what is actually happening. Coordination is shoddy and haphazard. #Covid_19 #Coronavirus
BarCouncils/Associations across country are silent on issue of #COVID19. We witness strikes/suspension of work for matters of no importance but in prevailing situation lawyers are left on their own, Courts must also suspend .
sad to hear we lost our first Arizonian to #covid19 - please be careful and take a moment to think of those who are ill
I love this covid-19 world:	People are uniting	Pointless shit is being put aside	The Government are throwing money around helping those in need	The services are getting the respect they deserve	Pollution has decreased	Despite the losses, the world will be a better place	#Covid_19
It’s scarier that the reports of how many new people have #Covid_19 are essentially a week old because of how long it takes to get the results. Literally thousands could have it in Ireland right now and we wouldn’t even know.
#مهرجان_تيماء_للغة_الانجليزية	 #Tayma_English_Festival	We are all responsible ..🇸🇦	Staying home is our most powerful weapon against #Covid_19
Glad I live in a small enough town and we shouldn't be to badly affected with #coronavirus 	I'm seeing loads of pictures from across england with no social distancing and its giving me anxiety. 	Feel for the ones trying.
I see good practice of social distancing in Cuomo's news conference. I don't see any of that in the WH briefings. Please keep Dr. Fauci safe. #COVID19 #SocialDistancingNow
I've nearly finished fighting of a #COVID19 infection. Things I have learned: 		1) Its not always mild for younger people		2) The early stages were barely noticable		3) You will need all the paracetomol you can safely take		4) You need to take this seriously		5) People are kind.
Like how terrifying is this knowing your father is coming home after seeing dozens of fever, coughing patients when the govt can't even provide safety equipments for the med staffs. I'm not OK:/	 #COVIDー19 #CoronavirusPandemic
i don't have social anxiety but the supermarket was so overwhelming today that i went to the loo and had a cry. when i came out, someone had pinched the flowers i bought for my nan for Mother's Day. the only flowers left were dying or damaged. so heartbroken i just left #COVID19
Also watching him coughing whilst preparing orders handling money and not once did he wash his hands #Covid_19 #COVID_19uk I imagine you would be able to witness this on the cctv in store.
We are in a critical public health problem that requires global cooperation. #Covid_19 #stayhome #globalhealth
Boris closed everything too late in the UK . UK residents are going to suffer greatly #Covid19 #CoronaCrisis #Covid_19
be responsible to accept polices issuing by police department/ health departments! #curfew #CoronavirusOutbreak
China being a dictatorship and a much advanced nation than us took months to recover(god knows true or false) from #Covid_19, India with huge population where none follows rule of law and where the PM is "urging" people to be seld quarantined and stay home, Gods save us!
Put Gauteng on LOCKDOWN!!		Tough decision bt it is needed to prevent this #Coronavirus from spreading all over SA.		Once thos get to over 1000 next week it will be difficult to contain.		Leaders pls take unpopular decisions that will save SA lives.		People before profits
I can continue to work flexibly around my children, maintain some level of support but without overburdening an already stretched education/childcare sector and so can plenty others. Don’t be selfish and think of the real #keyworkers who need that provision to help us #Covid19
Stay home #coronavirus
It's time to #LockDown #NEPAL #Coronavirus #covid19nepal
Stay safe everybody and avoid going outside if it's not necessary that much. It's a tough time for all of us. We can stand together and can fight against it. In Shaa Allah 	#CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19 #lockdownpakistan #StayHomeStaySafe
In 1 MONTH (21st Feb-21st Mar 2020) there have been over 4,000 #Covid19 deaths in Italy.  Comparison, to Northern Ireland in the last 3 months 2019 (provisional data) there were just over 4,000 of ALL deaths in total! This is 1 serious nasty virus. Be safe, take precautions.
You'd think with #Covid_19  People wouldent on mass visit national parks....Well from how busy iv been told it is you'd think the schools being closed was a holiday.	.....some people really don't care about others do they.
