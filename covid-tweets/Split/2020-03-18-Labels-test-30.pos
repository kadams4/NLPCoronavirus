I'm so sick and tired of that bitch Rona. She's taking our happiness and making it her ownnn. She is squeezing the life out of older folks and dividing us. She is disturbing our work and taking away our day to day activities. Let's pray away this bitch #coronavirus.
At the start of this #coronavirus #covid19 saga when I was watching people drop dead in videos from China and Iran. The Australian government was claiming they were well prepared. Now they claiming they don't have enough test kits and medical supplies and masks for health workers
Cases have been reported in neighbing countries - Ghana, Benin Republic, Cameroon. Others are Liberia, Burkina Faso.	If we don't have the right equipment at the land &amp; sea borders, shut them.	#coronavirus 	#CoronaVirusNigeria 	#CoronaVirusLagos
#NPC it’s delusional to believe our #Covid_19 cases are at 460 when we haven’t been testing a single suspected local transmission! Strap yourselves in and secure your elderly mum/dad nan or pop cos they are being thrown under the bus by #ScottyFomMarketing #shutdownaustralia
Not young, not healthy, have to work, husband is face to face with people all day at work, young baby at home. Straight up have a fear of dying right now. Certainly don’t think I’ll get care if I do get sick. #coronavirus
All the protests must be stopped for the precautions. 	We know that you all are brave. But this government is in no mood to listen to you. 		So for the safety of your family and friends you must stop.  	#CoronaVirus
Airports should immediaty close. Some infected idiots are taking paracetamol to dodge the checking..but in process infecting hundreds. #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID19 #covidindia
Take it seriously or it will take you seriously. #CoronavirusOutbreak
Right, you whingers. School will be closed from Friday. This doesn't mean leaving your little one  run a havoc. Or doing playdates. It's a #quarantine not a holiday 😏		#coronavirus 	#lockdown
