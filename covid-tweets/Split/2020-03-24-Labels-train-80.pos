A global pandemic is not the time to exercise your civil rights. It's the time to sit down shut up and stop getting people sick. 	#covid19 	This is why the US is doomed.
Gonna watch all of Quentin Quarantino‚Äôs movies this week. #seewhatijustdid #COVID19 #StayHome #QuaratineLife #idontusuallyhashtagbutshitiwantthecredit

Do something!!!	Quarantine everyone for 2 weeks until this shit is gone #Coronavirus
Just stay home as simple as that! You want your loved ones to be affected with corona virus? Fuck no!! Then stay fucking home! #coronavirus #lockdownuk
The country will not stay shut down for long. Our economy is a wasteful one organized around constant and irrational consumerism. Anything short of this will not fly with special interests. #covid19 #COVID„Éº19 #LockdownNow #StayAtHomeSaveLives #CoronavirusUSA
Community matters community strong....... now stay the hell away from each other.	#coronavirus
Love is the ultimate solution to stop further spread of covid-19. If you love yourself you will stay at home, if you love your family &amp; friends, you love yourself üòâ #COVID19
Dear everyone, because schools and offices have been shot down does not mean it‚Äôs time for hospital check-up,kindly stay at home if it‚Äôs not a severe case. I can‚Äôt believe amidst the #covid19 out break people are still flooding the hospital for reasons best known to them. Smh
America loves being #1 &amp; now Trump gonna make us #1 in #COVID19 infected &amp; deaths if he forces all shutdowns to end. Just to get the Stockmarket going.		Again Republicans	Profit over peoples lives.		#RepublicansAreKillingUs 	#TrumpLiesAmericansDie 	#TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER
If in doubt, don‚Äôt go out!	#COVID19 #LockdownNow #borisjohnsonpm #ilovelockdown #StayAtHomeSaveLives
If you found out today you were positive with the virus, would you be proud of your interactions the last few days in public? How many people would you have to notify that you potentially infected them? Keep that in mind for tomorrow. #COVIDActNow  #COVID19
Social Distancing : Great time for family bonding - Family games,. Lots of love, lots of laughter, helping each other, being there for each other.		#CoronavirusPandemic #SocialDistancing #familytime
Every day, more and more places are closing. It is so important for everyone to take COVID-19 seriously and stay home and keep your distance. Don‚Äôt go out unless you have to. The only way this ends is if we all do this. #coronavirus #StayHome
New York needs 30,000 ventilators. They NEED.	Can you even imagine 30,000 people on ventilators lined up?	How many people are needed to take care of just one?	#StayHome #COVID19
If Taylor Swift can disappear from the public eye for an entire year without anyone seeing her, y‚Äôall can stay home for a couple weeks without going anywhere non essential. Geez. #Michigan #shelterinplace #coronavirus
Distance is power against #COVID19!  #StayHome and do your part to help stop this thing in its tracks!  1st responders &amp; all those on the front lines need you to!  Feel helpless? Want to do something? THIS is how you will make a difference!  Be the example!
Just stay at home. 14days only guys. 	#COVID19 #prayformalaysia #StayHome
#TurunkanHargaBBMdanListrik	SOCIAL DISTANCE [not] SOCIAL DISTURB #COVID19 #StayHome #DiRumahAjaDulu
People still not heeding advice. Tourists happily wandering around the station. Look, we need to stay healthy to facilitate the movement of key workers. Stay away. #COVIDIDIOTS #COVID19 #SocialDistance #stayhome
The President and GOP lawmakers calling on workers to go back to work after next week is an insane policy. Not only will it result in a vastly higher death toll than sustained shelter-in-place, the economy will STILL tank if millions get sick. #COVID19
Going to Walmart...  plans for social distancing...		1. I ran 2 miles and not showering before I go.	2. If all else fails, I will fart.		S/N: Essential trip for prescriptions.	#dontjudgeme #istink #pu #covid19 #socialdistancefarts
Italy has the worlds 2nd best health care system where india ranked at 112th.	Just Imagine the consequences if you don't lockdown. 	So its better to stay in your home for the next 10 days.	#StayAtHomeSaveLives	#CoronavirusPandemic #Covid19India
To the people who think that this #COVID_19 *pandemic* is not a serious problem and are not taking precautions to protect themselves and the people around them from the novel #coronavirus...I'm sorry, but you are all IDIOTS.		#COVIDIOTS
There‚Äôs nothing more profound than being part of something greater than oneself. I‚Äôm amazed by the courage, selflessness, &amp; determination of my fellow health care profs in battling #coronavirus . Every day we go to work is just as imp as every day that you choose to stay home. üôèüèΩ
The rhetoric of it being a good thing that it takes more confirmed cases in the US before we even match the number of deaths of other countries is appalling. 		That does not make it okay to ease on our response to this outbreak. 		#SocialDistancing #covid19 #Coronavirus #StayHome
Self-quarantine feeds my anxiety, but what absolutely makes my anxiety sky rocket is the thought that this president could just undo it all in a week for the sake of the economy, ignoring the fact that the economy will crash if we undo it all. #COVID19 #StayHome
It's the perfect time to make a huge clean up of our lives, the real one and the virtual one. I think. #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus #StayHome #march2020
There is no data suggesting the US is bending the curve. Many Americans are still not taking social distancing seriously. This will get worse. 		#Coronavirus
I know republicans like to project what they do or are going to do onto the other side but who know they meant the death panels would be one. At this rate we will have them all over this country by the middle of April. #coronavirus #StayAtHome
As a germaphobic misanthrope, I feel like I‚Äôve been preparing for this my whole life.		#ontarioshutdown #COVID19
God bless all our doctors, nurses and healthcare workers across the country caring for those fighting for their lives.		#COVIDActNow #COVID19 #lockdown #StayHome

#Trump is shot if he thinks we can go back to normal next week. Talk about reckless. He should go party with the spring breakers in #Florida. #COVID19
I‚Äôve had a broken foot since Jan basically forcing me into my own quarantine but w/o having any mobility (nightmare) Quarantine does NOT get better overtime! We need to get strict &amp; #COVIDActNow if not most of y‚Äôall are going to go absolutely fucking insane #COVID19 #LockdownNow

This is no joke. I‚Äôm running a low fever. I now know of 6 ppl sick, 2 confirmed virus. 		PLEASE don‚Äôt listen to our President or other politicians in denial. Listen to medical experts. I‚Äôm on lockdown anyway but for sure won‚Äôt leave the house for 2 weeks. 	#COVID19
PSA: We should already be taking Vitamin D supplements on the regs considering our side of the world doesn't get much sun but if you don't, now's a pretty good time to start cause #socialdistancing during #Quarantine means even less ‚òÄÔ∏è.  #StayHome but #stayhealthy too! #COVID19
This locked üîí down bout to get ugly Yal ! Might not be no going outside. No cap #COVIDActNow #COVID19 #StayHome #QuarantineLife
I hope everyone listens to this shelter in place put in by our Governor in La. Get this out of here and get back to normal living. Never knew how fast life can change till this. #Covid19 #shelterinplaceLa
Fijians have extended Families. If one gets #COVID19 there are high chances of 5 or more household members getting infected. Our Country may not have the means to cater for this PANDEMIC!!! Think before you leave your homes &amp; think of the LIVES at stake.
My sister‚Äôs co-worker said a lady in our city posted online she has #coronavirus. Our friend who works at our CVS confirmed &amp; forwarded the post. The lady came into contact with at least 14 people. WTF. It‚Äôs freakin‚Äô scary. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü¶† #StayAtHome #StayHome #selfisolation
Ok. So we are self-isolating and staying at home, playing our parts. What's the government doing in their part - apart from quarantining? Or are we just gonna all come out of self-isolation in 2-3weeks, and boom! We were all safe again? #COVID19 #Coronavirustoronto
"I think, in some respects, they welcome my voice out there telling the truth. I‚Äôm going to keep doing it. And no matter what happens to me, I‚Äôm going to keep doing it." - Dr. Anthony Fauci #fauci2020 #Quarantine #CoronavirusUSA #StayAtHomeSaveLives #scicomm #epitwitter
If you're getting in your car for things other than food, work, medical or anything essential, please get back in your house. Just think The Nightstalker Serial Killer/The Smoke Monster/The Boogeyman is on the loose and you need to stay safe indoors. #COVID19 #SocialDistancing

If you're stuck on how to approach the forthcoming days then just remember the slogan that never was;		"Don't  be a Cunt"		#UKlockdown #Coronavirus #StayAtHomeSaveLives
Gonna go have a drink(s) and a panic attack in the shower. ü•¥üíûüçπüç∏ü•É		And yet, I am very grateful #Inslee took this step. So many I have talked to think #CoronaVirus is still a joke. Well, noone is laughing in #Italy and #Spain you selfish assholes.
The prices of lemon and ginger are going up. Who started this story that lemon and ginger cure #coronavirus infection?		Biko! Don't harm yourself with an overdose of lemon or ginger.		Misinformation can cost you your health.		#LockDownNigeria #COVID19NIGERIA #SocialDistancing

#ukcoronavirus #UKGoverment the government is still not serious they should close essential and non essential and provide for people whatever they need there is a way Uk is a stable country please lockdown everything this way we can save life‚Äôs #CoronavirusBillUK #coronavirus
Well I thought for sure this stupid #coronavirus wouldn‚Äôt hit my rural town. We didn‚Äôt shut down any shops or anything. Now a guy is getting tested now with symptoms. My brother and I are isolating ourselves until results come infor kids and parents sake. I miss my kids.
In the US, young Americans are getting sick too. 12% of intensive care patients are 20-44 years. Patients are between 20-54 in hospitalizations. Young people can get it ! 53% of cases in NY are people from ages 18-49. We are all at risk #StayHome #coronavirus #COVID19 #usa
Tip of the day		#COVID19 		Information is vital, but where you get it from matters.	Evidence based medicine is the way to go. Please read informations about the virus from proper sources and tweets from professionals.		Do your part, #FlattenTheCurve
Highly disappointed in Africans in general, why am I still seeing people going to clubs and restaurants to flex on IG? 		It was all shits &amp; giggles when we told ourselves that black people cannot be infected by #COVID19 but NEWSFLASH, we are not immune.
One you get drunk and realize you don‚Äôt have to drive home... it gets better! ..... üòÇüò≠üò≠.        #QuarantineLife #StayHome #coronavirus
