The State government should make use of the Corp members currently serving, make use of youths who are ready to volunteer. Proper sensitization should be done so that everyone understands the importance of staying at home now. 	#COVID19 	#StayAtHomeAndStaySafe	#AbiaState

Peeps Stop being ignorant. Stay home safe. Going out there increases the number of this #COVID19. You won't see it now but it's gon be too late the time you realize of many lives lost and tortured. Stay indoor and save million lives.
I went to Walmart today. There were tons of people there that werenâ€™t social distancing nor taking the necessary precautions to safeguard themselves. People are still treating this situation lightly. We should brace ourselves for a lot more cases. #Coronavirus
Feeling emotional for the people out there risking their lives to save us. I wish there was something I could do to help them, besides stay home. #heroes #thankyou #COVID19
You donâ€™t realise just how often you touch your face until youâ€™re not supposed to touch your face.. 	#CoronaLockdown #COVID19 #coronavirus #StayHomeSaveLives #washyourhands
