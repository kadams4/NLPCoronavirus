#Covid19 - India as on 27 March, 9 AM:		Active cases: 640	Cured/Discharged: 66	Migrated: 1	Death: 17	Total cases: 724		A sudden surge in cases has been seen since yesterday. It may cross 100 cases in a single day today after that its gonna be crucial for India!		#coronavirusindia
The UK is being creative with the figures , were 9th in cases confirmed but 5th highest deaths at 5.4% of confirmed cases.  #COVID19
As of this evening, #Ontario with 37% of Canada’s pop’n has completed only 18% of the nation’s #covid19 tests, yet reports 21% of the cases.		Not keeping up with the rest of the country on testing, so undoubtedly under-reporting cases.		Failing on #ChristineElliott’s promise.
Ah right , India. Give it a few more days and we will probably have more patients admitted due to police violence than the virus.Graph it.	#coronavirusindia #coronavirus #21DayLockdown

#Costco giving public-facing employees hazard pay is appropriate and appreciated...but nothing after being sickened by that very hazard? #Costco is supposed to be better than this...especially during #coronavirus #COVID19
I am appreciative as a nurse for the appreciation. Yet still stunned. The NHS has served our country for 52 years. 52 years the NHS staff have been serving this country. Yet it has taken a pandemic to really show its value. #COVID19 #nhs #thankful #nurse #reflection #grateful
I wonder how many young kids now will grow up in 15 years and want to become a nurse or first responder due to the selfless act of all the nurses, doctors, first responders, &amp; medical workers who are working so hard to help #COVID19 patients. Like our generation’s 9/11.

As a citizen, it’s our right to criticize our country or government, but don’t be too negative &amp; full of hatred, esp. if you don’t come up w/ a better solution or idea! No system will ever please everyone, but do try to look for the good before you scream about the bad.  #covid19
USA #1 in the world in: 	- Mass shootings	- Mass incarcerations 	- Military Spending	- Obesity 	- Student loan debt 	And now #COVID19 cases. 	...this is fine. This is all fine 🙃
I’ve worked at the same job for 15 years. FIFTEEN years at an primary care clinic. Today I was told that everyone’s hours will be cut due to the #COVID19 outbreak. Primary care isn’t the concern right now. So yeah, I’m nervous AF about money now... 😔		#CoronavirusPandemic

#coronavirus in my theory, to keep the immunity high, and keep the Corona virus at bay, figs and bananas need to be consumed alot. Keep the potassium level, natural sugars and vitamin k and a levels up. While the fever is kept under check with paracetamol.
I want to kick #COVID19 in the balls

Finished second day on the wards during #COVID19 a few observations:	-went from 1 COVID patient yesterday to 5 today. The floor that I have spent ample time on for the past 9.5 years has a dramatically different feel to it: no visitors, everyone wearing masks, and a somber tone
To all the NHS team which include doctors, nurses, carers, GPs, pharmacists, volunteers and other NHS staff working tirelessly to help those affected by #COVID19: thank you.#ClapForOurCarers #ClapForNHS

#COVID19 was the best thing to happen to #Jamaica: Everywhere's 'clean',  the stock market's affordable, people get a break from nonsensical plantation life and it's generally less noisy and the shocking part: government showed it can actually put its foot down (sceptic)
