Quarter teen and chill ? ðŸ¥µðŸ¤•	#coronavirus
Social distancing? It's not halal, let's go out in thousands and protest. 		#coronavirus #coronavirusindia #StaySafeStayHome #COVID2019 #AntiCAAprotests
No disrespect but is there a connection between #Kobe and the #coronavirus As in he didn't really die...like the Elvis conspiracy? Think back to what was going on January 26th. Weird but anything's possible I suppose or maybe I've got #cabinfever
Government forcing private businesses to shut down and/or forcing individuals to stay in their homes is tyranny whether thereâ€™s a pandemic or not. #COVID19 #COVID19ohio
Seen a tweet fae some dozy cunt saying China made #covid19 as a biological weapon.   Aye,  design a weapon that kills old folk.  Geez peace ya mangled fud!
I can be critical of the government at the same time comply with protocols. 		COMPLIANCE is different from BLIND AND SILENT OBEDIENCE. 		I ALSO do my part to help with GROUND OPERATIONS.		So yes, I have every right to call BS when I see BS. 		#Covid19
a note of caution for the ones that see the huge numbers of new cases in NY City: it is not because social distancing failed. Itâ€™s because we started testing on Monday! Expect to see further increase. Imagine if we were testing everybody as in S Korea! #coronavirus #NYCLockdown
