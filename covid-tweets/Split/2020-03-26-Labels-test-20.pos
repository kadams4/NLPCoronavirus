My salon has now been closed till may 1st. Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs come to this, and I really hope people stay safe and follow the new regulations. Please stay home as much as possible if you can afford to. We won‚Äôt get past this if we don‚Äôt work together ! #CoronavirusMN  #COVID19
An IT colleague decided to come to work despite #coronavirus symptoms. He spent 1h30 close to me with occasional coughing. I moved back/away from him, used hand sanitizer on my computer he touched. He didn‚Äôt respect #socialdistancing. He tested positive and exposed meüñïüèº
Transitioning to a mainly work from home basis on Friday (with the except of essential mouse tasks every few days). I‚Äôve been in denial about this reality. Never did I imagine this would happen in my first 6 months as faculty. But we all must do our part to reduce #coronavirus
People who think that this shelter in place is lame infringement on their freedom are probably the same people who thought their parents partied every night when they were sent to bed! #Coronavirus #COVIDIDIOTS #fomo
I am self-employed so I follow shelter in place directives I have no #income if I contract #COVID19 I have no #HealthInsurance If I die from #coronavirus my granddaughters have no #childcare meanwhile most people in #Tulsa are bitching about limitations they aren‚Äôt even following

Montana keeps making leaps and bounds in cases. But we also make leaps and bounds in preventative measures. Stay home folks. Keep my job, coworkers, residents, you and your family safe. #work #hospital #COVID19 #SocialDistancing
Today one of my co-workers who busted my balls three weeks ago when I started carrying hand sanitizer and working from home thanked me. She said she's been safe and in the clear since I got her to act early.	#FeelingGood #coronavirus
raise your hand if you know what social/physical distancing means and are actually practicing it üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #COVID19 #PhysicalDistancing #FlattenTheCurve
P/2 anyone of those people could be transmitting the virus to the staff and in reverse, then return home to families an spread it a bit more. #StayAtHome AND SHUT THE SHOP. Seems all you want to do is sell cakes than save lives. #CoronavirusLockdown #COVID19 #coronavirusuk

It's all fun and games until grandma is drowning in her own blood and fluids. Stay the fuck inside! #COVID19
TIL the doctors at my wife‚Äôs OB office are each on-call 1 day of the week for ALL deliveries that day to limit bodies in the hospital. If 1 of them catches #COVID19 they ALL have to quarantine as they work daily out of the same office out of the hospital. So please, stay home.
Colorado mandates all non CRITICAL businesses to shut down and a stay home order is in place tomorrow morning. Gues who‚Äôs job refuses to close because they‚Äôre exempt, MINE I still have to deliver you assholes pizza and risk my health doing so it I‚Äôll be fired. #coronavirus #fuck
Someone just held the door for me for few more seconds‚Äîso that I don‚Äôt need to hold the door handles. In time like now, this is a very act of kindness. #Covid19 #hk
It‚Äôs 2020 and if you don‚Äôt use an app to purchase meals, ie Starbucks or Chickfila, etc., you‚Äôre increasing your risk of contracting ANY illness, not just #COVID19 and increasing your chances of passing an illness. Do the world a favor, cause I really enjoy Starbucks.
The amount of people still not taking #COVID19 serious is just frustrating. Care about your family, friends and your neighbors! Think about how much it would hurt you if someone you loved got sick and didn‚Äôt recover. Everyone has that person. Be the change even if it‚Äôs small.
As we exercise all caution, keeping social distance, regularly washing hands with soap or sanitizing, staying at home, let us all remember that Him who loved us has declared us more than conquerors!	So Lesotho shall remain with 0 "official" and 0 "unofficial" #COVID19 cases!
#NewYork #schooldistricts ought to stop playing this silly game of short term closures. I know teachers who think they are going back after spring break! Delusional! #RochesterNY #ROC #MonroeCountyNY 	#coronavirus 	#SchoolsOut
