If the United States doesnâ€™t start itâ€™s economy back up within a week, it will be devastating. We are witnessing the deaths of our freedom, our free market and the dollar. Socialism is a worse virus than  #COVID19.
As of right now. Worldwide chances of getting the virus are 0.005% and chances of dying are 0.0002%. What pandemic?? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ #coronavirus #COVIDIDIOTS #COVID19 #Trump2020 #KAG #FakeNews #pandemic
If you ever been to county jail, you're immune to #coronavirus

Less than 0.001% of the UKâ€™s population has the #coronavirus
Iâ€™m still not seeing a pandemic. I do see a seasonal virus out break like every year.	Is this now going to be a yearly event? Shutdown 4 a couple months because people catch the flu &amp; die? Not to be harsh but the numbers are just not adding up.		#coronavirus #CoronavirusLockdown
arent you way more likely to die in prison from a zillion things over #coronavirus
In the US, smoking kills more than 480k annually,  40k die in car accidents, 5Ok die from suicide, 80k die from diabetes, more than 50k died from flu last year.  We should take #Covid19 serious but we are losing our minds when the death rate will likely be under flu. Its 809 now.
Interesting how we're told if we stay inside that corona virus won't spread as much but they lowered airline tickets knowing DAMN WELL ppl will leave their homes ... 	to further spread it... 	interesting #coronavirus
I don't stress over media hoaxes. #coronavirus
please everyone stop consistently telling ppl to stay inside, its demeaning and creating the impression that you are better than me		I'd like to go to work &amp; get food 4 my family without the feeling of being judged by ppl behind curtains		#coronavirus	#StayHome
