Hey people, no need to panic. Just practice proper hygiene. If you have a chronic illness, stay away from people. Don't visit our seniors in long-term care facilities. They're vulnerable. JUST USE COMMON SENSE and stop hoarding TP and Lysol wipes. #Covid_19 #CoronavirusPandemic
I for one am looking forward to hunkering down with my family for awhile. We’re lucky enough to have our health and a big family that all gets along. We may not be together like this 4 long. 		We will happily do our part to protect those at risk. 		#covid19 #pandemic #ShutItDown
Any Medical experts out there? If you contract Covid-19 today, when next season arrives, can we get it again? #Coronavirus #Covid_19 #doctors #nurses
This seems extreme but it's effective in stopping the spread of the virus. I'm going crazy tbh having my freedom taken away but what can ya do. Just letting you know that this might be your situation also..hopefully not, just be prepared. #coronavirus
Pandemic #coronavirus will give us a great lesson that we are weak creatures, but also the strogest ones as if we unite and hold on all together.		Our enemy is not between us, but something outside humanity which actually we ourselves have made.		Stay strong!
We have to pray and unite as one during the  #CoronavirusPandemic. When schools close, some children will go hungry. When places close, some people will not get paid. We need to support and love one another.
You can literally hear the gears of society grinding to a halt #coronavirus #COVID19
Stay hygenic everyone🙏🏻🧴 #Covid_19 #CoronavirusPandemic #ManilaLockdown
I'm angry and sad ...how selfish you be?  Why aren't you taking this seriously? You are putting others at risk! Be diligent! Wash your hands, keep a social distance and *please* don't travel! #airhugs #caringisnothsharing #COVID19 #covid19Canada #CoronavirusPandemic
Don`t panic but take it seriously. Let`s fight both the virus and the anxiety. We all wish to stay home but life must go on. Protect the entry points. All the more your hands and your soul. Also sentido kumon. #Covid_19
#Coronavirus y’all need to stop buying everything. Some people actually don’t have anything yet. I have been looking for hand sanitizer and masks for over 2 weeks now, and still everything is always outta stock. Get what you really need. Don’t take the whole store. 😕😕😕
Just a reminder: please be kind to your health care providers #CoronavirusPandemic #fluseason #overwhelmed
