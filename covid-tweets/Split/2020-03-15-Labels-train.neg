It‚Äôs too bad that the mainstream media has ruined its credibility at a time when most Americans need fair news reporting on a very serious topic.  #COVID„Éº19 #coronapocolypse #coronavirus #media
I think giving the #coronavirus it‚Äôs own emoji just gives it power that it really doesn‚Äôt deserve ! ü§î
Its the fear n panic that will kill us #COVID19
Most of the planet just learned how to wash our hands. I know we‚Äôre worried about toilet paper, but anyone worried about the global water supply? #COVID„Éº19 #coronapocolypse #coronavirus #panicshopping #toiletpapercrisis #ToiletPaperApocalypse
The same as the flu, a very common virus that pretty much everyone gets, is the corona virus even real or is it a cover up for something more sinister. What are the government hiding?? #COVID„Éº19 #HighRiskCovid19 #lockusdown #CoronaVirusUpdates #coronavirus #boris (2/2)
After a short discussion the wife and I have decided NOT to participate in the #CoronaVirus hysteria of 2020. 	#Winning ‚ù§Ô∏è
Media should not give the exact number of cases, it would create chaos throughout the country.	#coronaVirus
I can‚Äôt kiss the homies goodnight anymore because of this fucking corona virus #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus fuck you
I‚Äôm not a medical professional, but I have watched a lot of Greys Anatomy! 	I bet Bailey could find a cure for #COVID19 in a 47minute episode!
Please stop posting about #COVID19, some of us aren't caught up. I am only at Covid11. #SpoilerAlert
The only thing good about people freaking out over the #CoronaVirus is that gas is cheap as fuck üëÄ
Just think, who stands to gain if we are all taking about the #coronavirus and nothing else?
If our computers survived LimeWire than we can survive #Coronavirus
What‚Äôs really the truth about Covid19??? #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus #COVID19 #COVIDCanada #COVID19Ontario
Who wants to quarantine and chill? #COVID19 #coronavirus #coronavirusuk #CoronaVirusUpdates #StayTheFHome
I can't wait for two weeks to pass and this whole corona virus to be over, oh wait... #coronavirus
My favorite show as a child was supermarket sweep. I was born for this. #coronapocolypse #coronavirus
If we cyberbullied a hurricane out of existence, we can do it to a virus. #coronavirus
The #coronavirus #COVID19  mainly affects old white people ( and people with compromised immune systems) and since the powers-that-be are white, that's why they've been panicking cuz this could literally take them out and change the power structure all over the world.
Black men can‚Äôt get the Coronavirus because his girl gone swear he got it from another bitch ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇüòÇ	#COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdates #StayHome #Coronaviruscameroon
Wash handsüñê catch coughs ü§ß self isolate ü§í. 	This should help reduce  ~1000 global flu deaths per day (oh and ~50 global #coronavirus deaths too) ü§î
Between my dad warning me not to aspirate in my sleep and my MIL telling me to put bacitracin in my nostrils, I‚Äôm definitely safe from the #coronavirus
Ok anyone who had #covid19 can you tell your symptoms on day 	1 to day14	Ex day1 nothing	      day2 nothing	3...
Hmm...to take advantage of cheap flights and take a trip...  Or sit at home and enjoy my abundance of toilet paper.  #choices #COVID19  #coronapocolypse
Just gonna be honest I'm more likely to catch the #coronavirus before I catch feelings again... #YallTrifiling lol
If you‚Äôre allergic to pollen do you just not go outside from March until August? Give me a break. #COVID19
The liberal media should be ashamed for politicizing the #coronavirus to hurt their ideological opponents through lies when they should be informing people.  They truly are the enemy of the people and their shameful reporting is proof. #TrumpDerangementSyndrome #JournalismIsDead
Life isn't worth clinging to without baseball. Take me now #coronavirus!
Coronavirus is the frienemy we never knew that we needed. #coronavirus #coronapocolypse
I feel like the #Coronavirus is a [test] to envoke fear into the minds of the masses to get people to take the #MarkoftheBeast.. or at least a way to move into the next phase of the #NewWorldOrder...
Smh, this whole #COVID„Éº19 scene is getting outta control . I understand people what to be safe but closing schools and closing the city us OD! Funny thing is the only people that want things closed is the ones that‚Äôs still getting paid.	#coronapocolypse #coronavirus #CoronaVirus
I‚Äôve actually lost all hope for America to remain free. The rate we gave our freedom away was staggering and we will never recover. #coronavirus
What if I‚Äôm not practicing Social Distancing, I just have Major Depressive Disorder?	#COVID19
As one goes through the symptoms of #Coronavirus disease, one feels like the disease is not something to be dreaded at all.
I'll be glad when this #coronavirus shit is over...I'm so annoyed by this.
