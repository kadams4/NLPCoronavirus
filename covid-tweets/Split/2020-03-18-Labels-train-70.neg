The only thing new in my normal is a temperature check before entering work. #whatssocialdistancing #massagetherapist #mynewnormal #coronavirus
Americans are still crying over #COVID19 while the Chinese are free and clear of the #CoronavirusPandemic  #wakeupamericans y‚Äôall are stupid
Wow!! Can't even go get my tooth fixed!! Dentist closing this some bullshit!!! #CoronavirusPandemic
REMINDER: You‚Äôre more likely to be killed by a Clinton than the #CoronaVirus
From my one module in Epidemiology in University I think I'm well placed to give my advice on the current pandemic which is..		'Wipe your lip and get on with it.'		You may return to your duties.		#coronavirus #covid19UK #COVID19 #giveover
Another day of the shop being a quarter full, another day of people asking why, its going to be like groundhog day for a few weeks #coronavirus I'm going to try and start a different conversation today as I'm giving up the will to live
I firmly now believe that #coronavirus is not what it seems and in fact the current behaviour by the elected elite is actually much more sinister.		Are they crashing economies globally on purpose so as to eventually ignite global growth.		Things are not adding up.
Restaurants can take away their seating but that's not gunna stop me from sitting on the floor #coronavirus
I'm a very reasonable and realistic person. I've looked at all the data and based on the reaction to this #COVID19 	Pandemic. 		The reaction is not adding up.	Not even close.
You have got children crying their eyes out because they can't sit their GCSEs 	My niece doesn't want her predictive grades as she wanted to actually sit them.	Months she has been preparing herself	#fuckyou #covid19UK #schoolclosuresuk #coronavirus #pisstake
Not normally a conspiratard, but can't help thinking the #coronavirus panic is a priming exercise for the shutdown of economic growth deemed necessary in order to "combat climate change". Either that or an extraordinary dovetailing of aims.
Honestly at this point more people are going to die from the response to the virus than the actual virus itself. And that‚Äôs scary. #coronavirus
I have this weird feeling that this is a VERY over dramatic way to try and reduce the impact on climate change... The press have fallen for it. The governments have fallen for it. Bet Greta Iceberg is rubbing her hands in glee at the thought of no travel! #coronavirus #COVID19
What is the safest country to travel in these days? 	#COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak
Willing to vote for whichever candidate will re-open the gym, now. #coronavirus #ChinaVirus #KungFlu
Like I said on my #podcast .. do anyone at least know someone, that know someone, that know someone, that told them , that they know someone that told die from the #coronavirus ?? Anyone.? I wait ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The odd truth about the #coronavirus is that it appears to have about a 1 in 50 chance of killing you.  Most black men have a higher probability of being murdered or sent to prison, especially after the #Biden/Clinton 1994 crime bill
Damn the rona got the bars closed down :/ ........... but we still got the trap house ehhhhh #COVID19 #coronavirus
Everyone is worried about the #CoronavirusOutbreak I‚Äôm just hoping my gym stays open
Ok.	My families life is potentially going to take a massive change in the next 24 hours, if not sooner.	All down to the hysteria regarding this #coronavirus .	200k case globally	8k deaths	The world melts.	Fucking stupidity on a grand scale.	Thanks a fucking lot you sheep....
This #COVID19 aint messing up my 21st
Why is coronavirus a big deal?! In public wear a mask and always carry hand sanitizer with you not butt load just the amount you need.		And always wash and rince vegetables when you get home. It's not so hard #coronavirus #coronavirustips
The #coronavirus is a scam!! Africa and India are not shutting down and they are doing fine! Wake up!!!
Glad that #Belgium gave us a soft #lockdown with #SocialDistancing cause we get to still go out and #workout on our ownor with 2 #Coronavirus 	Hope it doesn't get worst!
84383+ patients of corona have recovered worldwide. Let us spread the good news and positivity.	Faith over Fear.üòá		#CoronaInPakistan #COVID19
