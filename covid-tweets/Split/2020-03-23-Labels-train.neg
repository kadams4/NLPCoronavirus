I wonder if #COVID19 discriminates? Just bc I'm not 65 or barely breathing I can't get tested. Great job American doctors. I'll just continue going to work and try to act like I don't feel like absolute shit.
So in the US we had 80,000 people die from the flue last year alone. So we have a pandemic of 14,000 deaths GLOBALLY? I don't get it.  #Coronavirus
Globally (as of now), there are 99,792 people who are totally recovered from #CoronaVirus but you arenâ€™t told that
Don't get me wrong. #COVID19 is serious. 15,328 dead globally.		However, there are more homicides per year in the U.S. alone -- and "flattening the curve" doesn't apply to murder. (1/3)		#coronavirus #COVIDãƒ¼19
I think the electric waves are the reason.ðŸ˜†	#Covid_19 #physics
In the end this virus will kill more businesses than people. #coronavirus #hysteria #facts
