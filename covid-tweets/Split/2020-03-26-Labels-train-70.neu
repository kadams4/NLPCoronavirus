Since the beginning, experts have stated the United States was roughly 10 days behind Italy. If this still holds true, we are in for a rough couple weeks. We need leadership and understanding. We need, honestly, some civility and empathy. We just need to be better. #Coronavirus

So I probably have #COVID19. I’ve got a warm enough forehead that feels like a fever. I’ve been coughing and sneezing like cray cray. My nose is still stuffed after sneezing. My chest feels like it’s compressed and hard to breathe in. I’ve been told I’m better off at home. AMA

Trump calling this the ‘Chinese Virus’. All he’s trying to do is denounce China, to give it a stigma so that the USA will be the superpower. Dangerous game. Dangerous game. 	#coronavirus
Scared about losing your insurance if you get laid off because of the #coronavirus pandemic? Relax! There's a law called COBRA that lets you pay even more for the same insurance while you're unemployed and not making money. It's a beautiful thing!
The entire humanity should isolate china, "they are the virus". No one should have trade relationships with them. They should be taught a lesson.	#IsolateChina	#ChinaVirus	#Covid19	#coronavirus

What are the Constitutional implications of suspending all criminal jury trials in the wake of #COVID19? Are the accused just sitting in jail indefinitely awaiting trial? Is there a provision that allows the courts to force them to wait because of a crisis? #QTNA
Just want to point something out: While more news outlets are getting more clicks (even while ad revenue is slipping), many of those same outlets are making vital #COVID19 coverage free. Pretty selfless, isn’t it? #SupportYourLocalNewspaper

If Trump supporters are so convinced he's doing a wonderful job:		How do they explain why so many medical personnel don't have enough PPE?		Why can't they explain why Trump said there's no problem for 2 months? 		Or why he then said he knew there was a problem long ago?		#COVID19
