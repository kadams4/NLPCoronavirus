What is the safest country to travel in these days? 	#COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak
a note of caution for the ones that see the huge numbers of new cases in NY City: it is not because social distancing failed. It’s because we started testing on Monday! Expect to see further increase. Imagine if we were testing everybody as in S Korea! #coronavirus #NYCLockdown
Restaurants can take away their seating but that's not gunna stop me from sitting on the floor #coronavirus
Damn the rona got the bars closed down :/ ........... but we still got the trap house ehhhhh #COVID19 #coronavirus
Glad that #Belgium gave us a soft #lockdown with #SocialDistancing cause we get to still go out and #workout on our ownor with 2 #Coronavirus 	Hope it doesn't get worst!
Why is coronavirus a big deal?! In public wear a mask and always carry hand sanitizer with you not butt load just the amount you need.		And always wash and rince vegetables when you get home. It's not so hard #coronavirus #coronavirustips
Government forcing private businesses to shut down and/or forcing individuals to stay in their homes is tyranny whether there’s a pandemic or not. #COVID19 #COVID19ohio
