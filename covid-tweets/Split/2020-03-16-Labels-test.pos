On my timeline I am trying to reflect the most accurate opinion &amp; information I am coming across. I am not intending to be alarmist or dramatic. I am truly incensed about the lack of government action at a time when prevention is so important to save lives. #coronavirus #coronaau
The spread of Covid-19 is out of control, we must postpone all primaries until this is under control. Knowing the American election system, these primaries will result in hundreds standing in lines for hours on end. This is definitely a disaster waiting to happen. #coronavirus

For those that already know and for those that have no clue, please stay at home. Donâ€™t be a risk for yourself and more so, for others. Nobody would be happy about an infected idiot running around infecting all in his path. Donâ€™t be that idiot. 	#COVID2019 	#CoronavirusOutbreak
So...we need to have a great plan for the next month...not just two weeks. #COVID19 #ALCORN_RYS20
