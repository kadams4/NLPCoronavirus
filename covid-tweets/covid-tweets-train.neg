We're not going to let the #coronavirus keep us from doing what we always do on St. Paddy's day.
Now that China is getting back to normal, Americans should make their way over there and reintroduce the virus to their population. It‚Äôs only fair. #CoronavirusOutbreakREMINDER: You‚Äôre more likely to be killed by a Clinton than the #CoronaVirus
a note of caution for the ones that see the huge numbers of new cases in NY City: it is not because social distancing failed. It‚Äôs because we started testing on Monday! Expect to see further increase. Imagine if we were testing everybody as in S Korea! #coronavirus #NYCLockdown
Another day of the shop being a quarter full, another day of people asking why, its going to be like groundhog day for a few weeks #coronavirus I'm going to try and start a different conversation today as I'm giving up the will to live
Not normally a conspiratard, but can't help thinking the #coronavirus panic is a priming exercise for the shutdown of economic growth deemed necessary in order to "combat climate change". Either that or an extraordinary dovetailing of aims.
This #COVID19 aint messing up my 21st
Glad that #Belgium gave us a soft #lockdown with #SocialDistancing cause we get to still go out and #workout on our ownor with 2 #Coronavirus 	Hope it doesn't get worst!
I can be critical of the government at the same time comply with protocols. 		COMPLIANCE is different from BLIND AND SILENT OBEDIENCE. 		I ALSO do my part to help with GROUND OPERATIONS.		So yes, I have every right to call BS when I see BS. 		#Covid19

The odd truth about the #coronavirus is that it appears to have about a 1 in 50 chance of killing you.  Most black men have a higher probability of being murdered or sent to prison, especially after the #Biden/Clinton 1994 crime bill
I firmly now believe that #coronavirus is not what it seems and in fact the current behaviour by the elected elite is actually much more sinister.		Are they crashing economies globally on purpose so as to eventually ignite global growth.		Things are not adding up.
Everyone is worried about the #CoronavirusOutbreak I‚Äôm just hoping my gym stays open
Seen a tweet fae some dozy cunt saying China made #covid19 as a biological weapon.   Aye,  design a weapon that kills old folk.  Geez peace ya mangled fud!
The #coronavirus is a scam!! Africa and India are not shutting down and they are doing fine! Wake up!!!
Honestly at this point more people are going to die from the response to the virus than the actual virus itself. And that‚Äôs scary. #coronavirus

Ok.	My families life is potentially going to take a massive change in the next 24 hours, if not sooner.	All down to the hysteria regarding this #coronavirus .	200k case globally	8k deaths	The world melts.	Fucking stupidity on a grand scale.	Thanks a fucking lot you sheep....
I have this weird feeling that this is a VERY over dramatic way to try and reduce the impact on climate change... The press have fallen for it. The governments have fallen for it. Bet Greta Iceberg is rubbing her hands in glee at the thought of no travel! #coronavirus #COVID19
Wow!! Can't even go get my tooth fixed!! Dentist closing this some bullshit!!! #CoronavirusPandemic

Instead of "#flatteningthecurve" and prolonging our misery, let's just "rip off the band-aid" and get this over with! Long term stressing of hospitals is worse than a short term spike. And it's killing the economy. #COVID19
You can literally create a flu by yourself just by thinking about it.. 		These spin doctors know all about the laws of attraction &amp; that's the weapon they are using against humans, an attack on their biology via consciousness information manipulation.	#COVID19	#CoronaVirusUpdate

This #COVID19 is gunna crash our economy &amp; civilization if it carries on for too long.		Those vulnerable should be isolated but everyone else needs to return to normality sooner rather than later
Hi virus,	You will never be able to touch me 	#COVID19
If I hear one more person start their press release/email/meeting with "it's business as usual" I might just lose it. 	I don't care where you are or what you do, nothing about this is "usual".		#covid19 #flattenthecurve #stayhome
The world leaders probably couldn‚Äôt fulfill their vision 2020 promises so they created the #COVID19 ü¶† virus to distract the world from asking the tough questions that‚Äôll come sooner or later.
I refuse to panic about #coronavirus until it‚Äôs death count surpasses the Clinton‚Äôs

Keep sanity in mind. Do not let the government take full control. People have to work. The government can not support us all. If they could they would already be doing it. We're in extremely dangerous waters. Be brave. Be American. #coronavirus

I‚Äôm not at all worried about getting sick from this stupid #coronavirus but I am worried about businesses closing, events getting postponed, supplies running low and all these crazy changes that affecting everyone‚Äôs livesCovid-19 i gonna leave more people bankrupt and dead from suicide (when people lose their job, savings, home) than actual deaths from the virus...		#COVID19 #Corona

Take the #coronavirus seriously, but don‚Äôt lose your mind over it. 		While some people are vulnerable to it, yes, 90% of people that catch it will make a recovery without a problem.
Stay in place orders in New York,California and now Illinois. What do they have in common ? Democratic states maybe? #MAGA #coronavirus #IllinoisPeople should be more worried about the financial collapse that will be happening than the #Covid_19 		A gun is better than no gun.

#Coronavirus #Covid19 #Covid_19 is a #scam. Why?	Most deaths are old people and with pre-diseases (cancer, hypertension,...etc) which can all cause death.	Death rates are inflated bcos of the detection sample driven by old people who visit hospitals regulary vs young ones.
Postie said Royal Mail announced full pay &amp; no disciplinarians for excessive sick leave. Next day 13 at his depot called in sick. People been laid off, desperate for work &amp; others swinging the lead.  Despicable!  Don‚Äôt deserve jobs üò° #Covid_19

Almost a month has passed since the quarantine in Japan. I‚Äôm not so scared of #coronavirus anymore, but getting scared ppl are so quiet here. There‚Äôs no longer a panic, an abuse, a line for the paper. But smth weird. I feel ppl are sunk into stress n have forgotten how to relax.I wonder if #COVID19 discriminates? Just bc I'm not 65 or barely breathing I can't get tested. Great job American doctors. I'll just continue going to work and try to act like I don't feel like absolute shit.
So in the US we had 80,000 people die from the flue last year alone. So we have a pandemic of 14,000 deaths GLOBALLY? I don't get it.  #Coronavirus
Globally (as of now), there are 99,792 people who are totally recovered from #CoronaVirus but you aren‚Äôt told that
Don't get me wrong. #COVID19 is serious. 15,328 dead globally.		However, there are more homicides per year in the U.S. alone -- and "flattening the curve" doesn't apply to murder. (1/3)		#coronavirus #COVID„Éº19

In the end this virus will kill more businesses than people. #coronavirus #hysteria #factsEver more messages in my inbox from local companies that have to close, laying off workers and feebly hoping to reopen in the future.

Yall want me to preach "We over Me" now? But when black people are shot my police officers its "oh well lol" when poor people are kicked out on the street because they cant pay bills its "lol get a better job" nah fuck your elderly and fuck your fear. #Coronavirus
I‚Äôm thinking how did we get here? #COVID19 is brining the world to it‚Äôs knees and sinking it to a financial depression. I say it‚Äôs the news media with its fear mongering, promotion of hysteria, and their hatred of #realDonaldTrump
It‚Äôs no surprise that when the republicans need a distraction for their bullshit that trump says the dumbest Shit ever. #sideshow #ropeadope #distraction #coronavirus #letsOpenUpTheEconomy #DumbAssTrump

If the United States doesn‚Äôt start it‚Äôs economy back up within a week, it will be devastating. We are witnessing the deaths of our freedom, our free market and the dollar. Socialism is a worse virus than  #COVID19.

In the US, smoking kills more than 480k annually,  40k die in car accidents, 5Ok die from suicide, 80k die from diabetes, more than 50k died from flu last year.  We should take #Covid19 serious but we are losing our minds when the death rate will likely be under flu. Its 809 now.
