I really need to know the situation at the US border campa regarding the #CoronavirusPandemic Weren't people dying of the flu there already? What's going to happen to these people now??
Wow...Tom Hanks &amp; Rita Wilson test positive #COVID19
Does anyone know if Las Vegas is open I'm pretty sure that the casinos are a breeding ground for the #COVID19

Reality Check: COVID-19 does not watch/read the news. So whatever spin or rose colored glasses are put on, it is a virus so it does not care. #CoronavirusPandemic #pandemic
If #COVID19 was studied &amp; controlled back in Nov-Dec last year when the doctors 1st raised the issue instead of them being censored &amp; prosecuted, none of this would be happening.We are all suffering the damages caused by Chinese gov. #HumanRights #FreedomOfSpeech #CensorshipKills
It’s 2 am and I can’t sleep because I’m worried about the #CoronavirusPandemic
Sports is done for awhile. Face it. And it stinks. #CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19
They’ve found they Coronavirus can have strong symptoms in some, and hardly any in others. Some have none, but can still give it to others. Testing shouldn’t have to be a last resort at this point. #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirusTouch base with elderly neighbors and friends during this time of #COVID19 ...they may be anxious and/or afraid to ask for help. And when this has passed, keep the connection going 💞
14-day LOCKDOWN	Stay safe beautiful people. Good health is wealth. #Covid_19
As of this Saturday, they're closing Disneyland, California Adventure Park and Universal Studios Hollywood. I guess it's no joke right now. #CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19 #COVID2019
My body went through a lot with chemo/radiation. Since then, I have ridiculous immune reactions when exposed to the simplest things. I break out in a rash every time they flush my port (with saline only). Yeah, I’m worried that getting #Covid_19 would be particularly bad for me.
They believe up to 10,000 people are probably infected even though only 590 cases have tested positive. This means other countries should be wary of their actual numbers. You can only find positive cases of #coronavirus if you test for it!
We have to pray and unite as one during the  #CoronavirusPandemic. When schools close, some children will go hungry. When places close, some people will not get paid. We need to support and love one another.
Our hearts go out to everyone - in all walks of life, and all across the world - whose lives have been turned upside-down by the #CoronavirusPandemic.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you all in this difficult and uncertain time. #StaySafe #CountYourBlessings
It is not the time for Republican vs. Democrat. Life’s are at stake. It is up to Congress and the President to make sure ALL Americans are safe, protected and taken care of from this pandemic. Stop with they petty Social justice BS. #CoronavirusPandemic
I for one am looking forward to hunkering down with my family for awhile. We’re lucky enough to have our health and a big family that all gets along. We may not be together like this 4 long. 		We will happily do our part to protect those at risk. 		#covid19 #pandemic #ShutItDown
Why are people not taking Corona Virus seriously? The mortality rate of infected of 5%  or more in Italy is staggering! 	People don't realize how dangerous it is &amp; even if you get over it can scar you for life (literally) or you can spread it to your family members.#Coronavirus
Just Bc COVID-19 might not concern you, does not mean that it can’t kill your loved ones who have autoimmune diseases, respiratory issues, etc. so please, just wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water. A lil hygiene won’t kill you. #CoronavirusPandemic
right now with the #CoronavirusPandemic i ask you to check in on the ones most marginalized because they are the ones being affected 		* ALSO REMEMBER WE KEEP US SAFE*it is incredible to see the inginuity &amp; commitment to service librarians bring to their field in this time of crisis. live-streaming storytimes, organizing drive-up book pickups &amp; compiling lists of distance services. with patron safety in mind, we continue to serve. #Covid_19

Okay UK, the #Covid19 #coronavirus infection rates are going up and it’s getting widespread amongst the population. If you haven’t already it’s time to #ISOLATEtheELDERLY Get anyone older or frail to isolate now whilst it spreads through the young and healthy #herdimmunity
Switzerland has twice as many cases per capita than China. Why are we still reporting absolute numbers? Surprised to see Switzerland not making enough news compared to other EU counties. #Switzerland #coronavirus
Now 3rd death of #COVID19 in Poland.	It scares me a little bit more

Everyone needs to take the social distancing measures seriously.		‘I am likely to survive it if I contract the virus.’		That does not represent the effect of the virus to people you encounter.		Be a responsible member of society.	#Covid_19 #COVID2019
To all my friends in #healthcare both personally and professionally,  thank you for all you do, especially in times like this. Humanity is blessed to have you. ##EPeeps #IE #HealthCareWorkers #COVID19
I refuse to give in to panic and chaos. Yes, these are hard times, but with common sense and consideration we can make it.	Hold on to what makes you feel good: music, artwork, movies, gaming. Plus, the #earperfamily is here to support each other! 	#Covid_19
Don’t make patients pay for virus tests and treatment. People with lower incomes will be deterred from seeking treatment if they face health care costs, worsening the epidemic. #COVID19With as horrible as my immune system is, and how long I stay sick just from strep throat or a cold, I probably wouldn't survive getting the #coronavirus 	Please wash your fucking hands and stay home when you can.
#GoodVibes day 1: remember to thank all the cashiers and workers restocking shelves at the supermarket.. the working class people who keep on showing up (no paid sick leave) and who despite everything make us feel slightly more secure by keeping shops open #COVID19
The Army Corp of Engineers needs to start building emergency temporary hospitals today for the #coronavirus surge we are going to see in 4-6 weeks. We can’t let our hospitals become overwhelmed. #flatteningthecurve
I'm actually comforted by the rising number of people diagnosed with #COVIDー19. This means that people are being tested. 		REMEMBER: There are 10-25x more people WITH #coronavirus than what has been reported. Now it's about finding out who has it.
I don’t think I’ve ever been more disappointed in people my age. Your spring break vacation isn’t worth it, stay home, it’s what we owe each other. #COVID19
Like many others who decided to close today because of #COVID19 I debated with myself back &amp; forth for days. As difficult as it was I’m so glad now that I did it I’ll sleep a bit easier tonight. Do the right thing for everyone #closethepubs #closetherestaurants #LockdownIreland

My anxiety is off the charts with the #coronavirus please if you can stay home. Think of the wave of people that will sick that our hospitals can’t handle. #CoronavirusOutbreak
I was reading that many cases of spread of #COVID19 are caused by asymptomatic people. If that is the case systematic screening could be a good solution to understand where the virus resides.

people talk about coronavirus like its nothing, in ohio 1600 people have been confirmed positive.  40 people have died, thats 0.025 percent, doesnt sound like alot but thats 175 million deaths worldwide based off the data in ohio alone.  #coronavirusYou know what? It’s okay to be scared. This is a scary time. We have never seen something like this before. The virus is scary. The economy is scary. The way people are acting is scary. Don’t let anyone make you feel bad for being scared of what’s going on right now. #coronavirus
Just listened to doctors and nurses outside my exam room talk about how they were running out of places to eat due to the high volume of food service workers they had to deny #coronavirus testing to against their better judgement because they weren’t likely to die.
Advice wanted pls from anyone with mild #COVID19 and has recovered. 6 days v dry cough, tight chest, fatigue, shivers but no snot at all. Now coughing up hardish largish yellow green lung butter + from sinuses too, esp after lying down. Normal process? Still also got dry cough

At the start of this #coronavirus #covid19 saga when I was watching people drop dead in videos from China and Iran. The Australian government was claiming they were well prepared. Now they claiming they don't have enough test kits and medical supplies and masks for health workers

Since a lot of people still aren’t taking the proper precautions against #COVID19, bio analysts predict a best case scenario of 30,000 people infected by April 13th. That’s almost half the total infected in China. Next best case scenario? Over 120,000. #CoronaVirusUpdate
"it's just the flu" ok but I don't want the fucking flu either! #coronavirus
listen people are dying that have never died before. be safe 💯 #coronavirus
99% of them are innocent and they're unaware of this situation. So apart from screening, myself and most of my friends are educating them about the risk they're facing now. Just a little step in fighting against #COVID19 	I will continue this until my health allows me 🙏

Why we don’t learn from Other countries about how treat  #coronavirus. China, tested the people and just redirect the people to a different building, to those who were +. Uk is using the same  🏥 4 everybody. So everybody is touching he same lift, the same doors and all around.

I think we should use loud speakers of all Mosques/Temples to spread awareness regarding COVID19. This is least we can do to inform the masses that are still unaware of the basic DO's and DONT's.		#COVID #covid19 #coronavirus
Even when it feels close, the pandemic won’t really hit us until we lose somebody we love. At that point, all our opinions about it will take a different perspective. Some have died alone #COVID19

#Coronavirus isn’t #racist &amp; doesn’t #discriminate! #Rich, #poor black/white whatever #religion u believe in. #Superpower nations with nuclear bombs stand helpless. #Corrupted officials &amp; a poor decent #human struggling 2 bring food 4 his kids r all equal.
Honestly don’t think Boris Johnson was specific enough #coronavirus #HalfLockedDown
Everyone has this #BillionDollarQuestion when would this #CoronavirusPandemic ends?? The answer is us.. We have to #StayHome #SocialDistancing and #behealthy ..	By following the instructions from the #Government we can #SaveLives of who is getting affected to #COVIDー19 #staysafe
If we are to learn anything, it should be these things: 1) when the WHO, the CDC, every doctor and nurse and government official ask you to stay indoors and shelter in place, you do it; and 2) which toilet paper brands you will never, never, ever buy again #coronavirus
UK now on lockdown for 3 weeks, wonder if any of the people who still work with around 200+ people walking in and out will receive any pay in which to cover the hazard risk of being exposed too all of this at all? Especially the NHS and Supermarkets #coronavirus #UKLockdownNow
I pledge to support local businesses once this #coronavirus is over. For now #StayAtHome #quedateEnTuCasa #SocialDistancing
The #doctors are on the front line against #COVID19outbreak and this is the only line.	God Almighty save Humanity.	#CoronavirusOutbreak 	#COVID 	#LockdownNow 	#staysafe 	#StayAtHomeSaveLives 	#prayforitaly
Than I was standing) 	Laughing and joking. 		Look I know #coronavirus is for real and older people are more susceptible to the worst symptoms but that was pretty crazy. I hope that lady stays healthy.
Repost. 		Social distancing does not mean go chill at your friends house. Say no to social gatherings and isolate yourselves. 		Pyaar se samjha rahe hai, samajh jao. Warna police dande se bhi wahi kar sakti hai.😅 #COVID19 #Covid_19india
Don't panic, stay calm, stay safe, stay at home, we will together fight #coronavirus just follow guidelines of government #IndiaFightsBackCoronavirus #COVID19outbreak
Lol close EVERYTHING for a month!!! #COVIDー19 #coronavirus
The scientists who find the killer vaccine to end this #COVID19 enemy deserve the #NobelPeacePrize and the thanks from a grateful world population. We are cheering all of you on! 😊👍
I just want to stay home and keep binging #911onFOX 🔥🔥🔥		I don’t want to go to work and contribute to the pandemic 😡😡		#coronavirus #CoronaVirusCanada
Maybe now people will start to take it seriously. It's not hard guys, stay at home!!! The message is short and clear #lockdownuk #coronavirus
My pre-shift download yesterday. Preparing wills and decontamination routines. We need worker protections for healthcare professionals as well as all front-line workers who will keep us all safe during this outbreak. #StayHome #COVID19 #GetMePPEGoing to Walmart...  plans for social distancing...		1. I ran 2 miles and not showering before I go.	2. If all else fails, I will fart.		S/N: Essential trip for prescriptions.	#dontjudgeme #istink #pu #covid19 #socialdistancefarts
"I think, in some respects, they welcome my voice out there telling the truth. I’m going to keep doing it. And no matter what happens to me, I’m going to keep doing it." - Dr. Anthony Fauci #fauci2020 #Quarantine #CoronavirusUSA #StayAtHomeSaveLives #scicomm #epitwitter
Ok. So we are self-isolating and staying at home, playing our parts. What's the government doing in their part - apart from quarantining? Or are we just gonna all come out of self-isolation in 2-3weeks, and boom! We were all safe again? #COVID19 #Coronavirustoronto
Distance is power against #COVID19!  #StayHome and do your part to help stop this thing in its tracks!  1st responders &amp; all those on the front lines need you to!  Feel helpless? Want to do something? THIS is how you will make a difference!  Be the example!
Really want to throat punch my brother and sister in law. They are not taking self isolation seriously, at all, and are endangering my nephew aka my favorite human on the GD planet. We're in Florida and most Floridians also aren't taking this shit seriously. #COVID19 #StayHome
The prices of lemon and ginger are going up. Who started this story that lemon and ginger cure #coronavirus infection?		Biko! Don't harm yourself with an overdose of lemon or ginger.		Misinformation can cost you your health.		#LockDownNigeria #COVID19NIGERIA #SocialDistancing
There’s nothing more profound than being part of something greater than oneself. I’m amazed by the courage, selflessness, &amp; determination of my fellow health care profs in battling #coronavirus . Every day we go to work is just as imp as every day that you choose to stay home. 🙏🏽
God bless all our doctors, nurses and healthcare workers across the country caring for those fighting for their lives.		#COVIDActNow #COVID19 #lockdown #StayHome
As a germaphobic misanthrope, I feel like I’ve been preparing for this my whole life.		#ontarioshutdown #COVID19
We can’t just give up on social distancing, but we can’t let the economy collapse. In cases like these, we need a strong, measured response from our government. #government #economy #COVID19
Yo I’m showing myself so much love right now.. I’m trying to get right for when quarantine is over! #coronavirus #COVID19 #QuarantineLife #LockdownNow #KungFluFighting #StayAtHomeSaveLives #WhereIsFauci
Some people just don’t get it! Social distancing means stay the fuck home and only interact with those in your immediate household and only go out when absolutely necessary. If you’re still going out to hang out with your friends to habe fun, you’re part of the problem!! #COVID19
COVID-19 is not yet 21 and causing trouble 🤷🏻‍♂️		 #COVIDActNow #COVID19 #LockdownNow #StayHome

I hope everyone listens to this shelter in place put in by our Governor in La. Get this out of here and get back to normal living. Never knew how fast life can change till this. #Covid19 #shelterinplaceLa
Dear everyone, because schools and offices have been shot down does not mean it’s time for hospital check-up,kindly stay at home if it’s not a severe case. I can’t believe amidst the #covid19 out break people are still flooding the hospital for reasons best known to them. Smh
#coronavirus  is having so high attitude/ or like high attitude relative,  it won't come to our home. We need to go out and bring it. #StayHomeIndia #StayHomeSaveLivesAfter weeks now of this Covid19 issue, why can I still not find TP at the store? Seriously, stop hoarding 🧻. It’s not going to do you any good! #COVID19
Unless you too can rise from the dead I suspect Easter will be a bad time to stop practicing social distancing and #coronavirus mitigation efforts.
The #coronavirus crisis should remind us that decisions should be driven by scientific evidence and social values in order to promote the common good #SocialDistancing #values #Sustainability
What kind of world do we live in where young people (a small minority, not all) will say it's only killing the elderly so it doesnt matter. Since when do we not care if our elders are dying? #coronavirus
What I’ve learned the last few weeks...health and science are the two most important subjects...we are at their mercy #COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown #MyCovidStory

(2/3) #COVID19 My Mom was tearing up while telling me what happened. They WORKED HARD to prepare the food for the soldiers but their team was just SCOLDED for "blocking" the traffic and that they won't accept it for UNKNOWN REASONS, considering there's NO other VEHICLE passing by
It has been an #Emotional &amp; #Physical #Breaking say. The grocery worker in #Oshawa diagnosed with #COVID19 forced me to realize the risks my Mother is taking as a #GroceryCashier.  Also I've been #SelfIsolated for the last 12 days due to a fever at my last #PainClinic appt. 1/5
If you find that Government guidance is not clear, just use common sense. It’s not difficult. #staysafe #StayAtHome #COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown #commonsense
Please stay indoors if at all possible and take care of eachother. You do not want this or to pass it onto others #COVID19 #coronavirus #CoronaIreland #Isolation #Quarantine #StayHomeSaveLives
Day 8 no unnecessary interaction wth the outside world,as its 	First ever War of human race with invisible enemy against humanity i. e #coronavirus  and I prefer we must  fight it from home 🏡 for the sake of humanity.	#StayHomeStaySafe #COVID19Pakistan	#FightAgainstCoronavirus

Man if we can’t set politics aside just this one time we’re doomed as a species, people are dying man. We’re gonna get through this eventually, let the history books show we did everything we could to help one another. Stay home. #COVID19
This is a perfect explanation of how dangerous and different this virus is.	If you haven’t yet understood the importance of staying home in ISOLATION with NO EXCEPTIONS, please do read this.	#coronavirus #covid_19	Good read from an immunologist at Johns Hopkins University
From all indications,it seems we are all vulnerable now,please social distancing will be safe at this time.		#Covid19Out 	#COVID19People aren’t gonna take this quarantine serious until the rona starts hitting close to home and by then I just hope it’s not too late for y’all 😣 #StayHome #COVID19
The most important thing to realise we followers of Sanatan Dharma believe and worship nature, and Nature at the moment is demanding that we give it space and stay indoors. #StayHome #StayHomeSaveLives #COVID19
We have people complaining about no lockdowns on the entire country/their own states.	But think about this.	This disease is spreading only because YOU decide whether you get out of your house and go out in public or not.	And you’re deciding to go out.	#covid19 #coronavirus #usa
I'll make a prediction.. If the churches are full on Easter, the country will be in shambles by the 4th of July. #coronavirus #StayHome #BailOutThePeople
We are closed 🔐 #COVID19
You can’t reopen the country less than a week after most of it starts to Shut down.... I don’t think that’s how this is going to work.#COVID19
I wonder if the same people who laughed about the #coronavirus knocking off #boomers are still laughing? Still find that funny? #COVID19 🤔🙄😏
P/2 anyone of those people could be transmitting the virus to the staff and in reverse, then return home to families an spread it a bit more. #StayAtHome AND SHUT THE SHOP. Seems all you want to do is sell cakes than save lives. #CoronavirusLockdown #COVID19 #coronavirusuk
It has reached my circle. A family friend was put on a ventilator this afternoon. Take this seriously. Stay the fuck home. Don’t be selfish. #StayHome #ShelterInPlace #coronavirus #COVID19
People who think that this shelter in place is lame infringement on their freedom are probably the same people who thought their parents partied every night when they were sent to bed! #Coronavirus #COVIDIDIOTS #fomo
I am self-employed so I follow shelter in place directives I have no #income if I contract #COVID19 I have no #HealthInsurance If I die from #coronavirus my granddaughters have no #childcare meanwhile most people in #Tulsa are bitching about limitations they aren’t even following
The hospital my mom works at has 23 ventilators, 6 are being used. What happens when doctors have to start choosing who lives and dies? It’s all fun and games until it’s your grandma, spouse or child that needs it. #21daylockdown #lockdownnow #CoronavirusPandemic #COVID19
It’s 2020 and if you don’t use an app to purchase meals, ie Starbucks or Chickfila, etc., you’re increasing your risk of contracting ANY illness, not just #COVID19 and increasing your chances of passing an illness. Do the world a favor, cause I really enjoy Starbucks.
I can’t even hug my mom😞 #coronavirus
Can only imagine how angry the families of #coronavirus victims must feel knowing that someone passed that on just by selfishly not following advice ☹️#StayAtHomeSaveLives
Business to open up by Easter? People would like that, but people would also like to stimulate the economy without catching the virus or dying. We can #FlattenTheCuve but we don't dont want a second curve. #COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown #coronavirus #QuarantineLife
In this time of pandemic and quarantine I would like to remind everyone who thought I was crazy for wanting a drawbridge that I still think it’s a great idea. 		#COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown

Why do so many people think that CLOTHES SHOPPING at Target for 20 minutes is essential right now?? 😡 #coronavirus
I would trade my hazard pay, 80 extra sick hours, overtime pay in a heart beat for this #coronavirus to end I'm grateful for the job I have I just want this to end So please stay home you humans. &amp; stop over buying stuff we have enough food and TP Its hard to keep up w/ everyone
Lessons learned in sequestration, Day 14- My family requires more chocolate and cammomile tea than I expected.  #COVID19

About the #coronavirus :		You have 100 M&amp;Ms and 80 are great, 16 will make you sick, and 4 will kill you, if you mix them up, how many are you eating?		#StayHome

Going to a store to buy paint or flowers isn't essential. 	Please stop doing that. 	Stop bringing your whole family, we're trying to limit crowds. 	Stand six feet away and stop getting angry when we ask. 	It's that simple. 	Stay home. 	#Coronavirus 	#COVID19
