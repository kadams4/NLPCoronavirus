Anyone selling an old Corona? I‚Äôd like to buy an ironic purchase for the company and write-it off under the #ScottyFromMarketing #COVID19 stimulus
Im just no one here, but: Would the closing borders movement across the globe, the beginning of a 3rd war?   Maybe triggered by the increasing of the migrant crisis? #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #Coronavid19 #Corona
Jimmy Buffet tested positive for Margarita virus #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVirusUpdate #BREAKING
Do you support government funded testing and healthcare for those with #Covid19 #Coronavirus?		If no, please reply with what percentage of humans would have to die before you would?
I‚Äôm gonna say it. #COVID19 is a fraud. If it is real, I challenge it to come get me. Game on.
U would think people are throwing up in the streets, insane fevers, unable to breathe resulting in collapsing, can't hold waste. Oh wait that's #SanFrancisco #COVID19 #Corona #flu #TrumpTrain
Russia borders on China, but there is no epidemic and there will not be.  why?  because the Russians do not believe in the virus. This is cool, proud of my country. 	#CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVirusUpdate #CoronaVirusSA
Not worried about Tom Hanks having coronavirus. I mean, have you seen Castaway!?! #CoronavirusPandemic
Trumps speech is giving me big contagion and outbreak vibes. Fucking chills. #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdateIll be damned if I let #coronavirus ruin my birthday plans. THE SHOW MUST GO ON
#UnpopularOpinion Closing everything and cancelling school and events due to Coronavirus is rediculous.. If people would just have common sense and stay home if they are sick we wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it spreading. üò°#CoronavirusPandemic
This seems like an awful lot to give up for lent. #Covid_19 #corona
I‚Äôm kind of over people conflating responsible precautions and panic.  #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus #COVID19
The country will come to a stop until ppl realize the #FakeNews  with #Democrats behind scaring everyone. Thy put ppl in a panic so they can wreck the  #Trump  Economy. It‚Äôs all about hitting Trump for the Presidency.  #CoronaOutbreak is real but #politics caused Panic #Covid_19
I feel like the media blows every little virus out of proportion &amp; when there is an actual pandemic we didn‚Äôt take them serious. Now they‚Äôre canceling all this shit &amp; were like üò≥ okay it‚Äôs something to be worried about this time. #CoronavirusPandemic
This #CoronavirusPandemic is a joke / the human race has been really disappointing these last few decades #Bribe #Corruption #Politics #Money is all that matter to these #politicians 		#Lobbyist #Democrat #Republicans #Trump #Clinton #Bush #Obama #AmericaFirst #America #USA
I feel like at the end of all of this we will find out that this whole #coronavirus problem somehow was Antonio Brown‚Äôs fault #stillsour
Can people, please ! CALM THE FUCK DOWN ! It's a nasty flu, and if you've 80 with one lung you're fucked ! Everyone else - PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS #COVID19 #CoronavirusPandemicImagine a time where the Chinese economy is nearing collapse. As secret as they are, they wouldn‚Äôt let the world know. Instead they create a virus, spread it globally and somehow create a vaccine a year ahead of the world...and sell it globally... #coronaUK #covid19 #CoronaVirus
Sanitizing my insides with tequila. Alcohol is a solution.		Tagging all #coronavirus hashtags #CoronaVirusUpdates #CoronaOutbreak #coronapocalypse #COVID2019 #COVID2019 #COVID #CoronavirusPandemic #Coronavirustruth
Any danger of some media led positive vibes on Corona V?? A few uplifting vids of people who have contracted and come out of it fine maybe? Everything so far seems to be detailing death...obvs very sad but human reaction will be driven by what we see and read.  #COVID19
How fitting that people are acting irrationally on #PiDay 	#coronapocalypse 	#coronavirus 	#CoronaOutbreak 	#DatRona
People worried about Corona Virus don‚Äôt understand the horror that is the Wook Flu #COVID19 #itscoronatime #wookflu #festierat
Please dab to save the boomers #dabtobeatcoronavirus  #Covid_19
People are absolutely losing their minds!  God help us if anything way more serious ever happens.  Thanks a lot Media/Press. üôÑ #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus #mediapanic
Can we get a virus ü¶† that wipes out the stupid. Especially the toilet roll idiots. #CoronaVirusUpdates #COVID_19uk #coronavirus #coronaUK
I think I'm going to die faster from a #hangover than #coronavirusThe liberal media should be ashamed for politicizing the #coronavirus to hurt their ideological opponents through lies when they should be informing people.  They truly are the enemy of the people and their shameful reporting is proof. #TrumpDerangementSyndrome #JournalismIsDead
Anyone to blame for this #COVID„Éº19 spread is China. Hiding this for 2 months and keeping doctors quiet to alert others to prepare and close borders faster. #coronavirus
If our computers survived LimeWire than we can survive #Coronavirus
If you‚Äôre allergic to pollen do you just not go outside from March until August? Give me a break. #COVID19
After a short discussion the wife and I have decided NOT to participate in the #CoronaVirus hysteria of 2020. 	#Winning ‚ù§Ô∏è
Please stop posting about #COVID19, some of us aren't caught up. I am only at Covid11. #SpoilerAlert
Smh, this whole #COVID„Éº19 scene is getting outta control . I understand people what to be safe but closing schools and closing the city us OD! Funny thing is the only people that want things closed is the ones that‚Äôs still getting paid.	#coronapocolypse #coronavirus #CoronaVirus
Just think, who stands to gain if we are all taking about the #coronavirus and nothing else?Dear Coronavirus, please don‚Äôt take the 2020 MLB Season Away. #Covid_19
I'm all for dropping a nuke on China. They need to pay for this ruckus #coronavirus
Y'all really still tryna have a spring break with #coronavirus spreading
Another Dr who has become a #coronavirus expert. They keep lowering the age of it being serious - it was 70, then 65, now it's 60. But everyone younger will be okay if they get it. ü§î
Someone tell the Indians using deodorant will keep #coronavirus away from themüòê
The worst part about this #coronavirus is my cable off ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Can everyone chill about the #coronavirus ? It was made in China it won‚Äôt last long. üòÇ
The one good thing about #covid19, way fewer people on public transport.If the coronavirus is gonna prove anything it‚Äôll be the power of the media. #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak
Dogs created COVID-19 to make their owners stay home and give them cuddles. #coronavirus #COVID19au
Thanks Wuhan for spreading your sh!$&amp;y virus and closing down the world! #COVID19
Am I the only one who thinks the news are hiding something deeper? The way they keep going on about this #coronavirus to distract our concerns.
More people will be affected by the fall out from all this scaremongering than will be from the #coronavirus itself. It is deeply saddening, however on the scale it is nothing in comparison to other illnesses/diseases. Tell me, what is the underlying reason behind all this shit?
At what point do you cancel your vacation and go back home...? after the safari  right? #coronavirus
Off to work on a train. Not sure if this is necessary travel? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm guessing so since no-one is telling me otherwise. On the plus side it's nice and quiet for me to get some uni work done #whoknows #coronavirusWhat is the safest country to travel in these days? 	#COVID19 #CoronavirusOutbreak
a note of caution for the ones that see the huge numbers of new cases in NY City: it is not because social distancing failed. It‚Äôs because we started testing on Monday! Expect to see further increase. Imagine if we were testing everybody as in S Korea! #coronavirus #NYCLockdown
Restaurants can take away their seating but that's not gunna stop me from sitting on the floor #coronavirus
Damn the rona got the bars closed down :/ ........... but we still got the trap house ehhhhh #COVID19 #coronavirus
Glad that #Belgium gave us a soft #lockdown with #SocialDistancing cause we get to still go out and #workout on our ownor with 2 #Coronavirus 	Hope it doesn't get worst!
Why is coronavirus a big deal?! In public wear a mask and always carry hand sanitizer with you not butt load just the amount you need.		And always wash and rince vegetables when you get home. It's not so hard #coronavirus #coronavirustips
Government forcing private businesses to shut down and/or forcing individuals to stay in their homes is tyranny whether there‚Äôs a pandemic or not. #COVID19 #COVID19ohio#COVID19 alot has to be said for the way the media portrays the news in such events. Releases &amp; headlines should be vetted to curb the propaganda.  The resulting situation of the economy caused in part by #coronavirus is going to be far worse than the problem we are trying to fix
The weekend is upon us &amp; I am itching to go out since I was responsible due to #COVID19 last weekend. I wanna have a social distancing happy hour with my neighbors but they old as fuuuuck üôÉ
I‚Äôm so annoyed with all the celebrities asking everyone to stay home until things get better! It‚Äôs easy for them to do it, not for the rest of us who don‚Äôt have the means to do so.	#coronavirus #celebrityannoyins
Carona is a perfect example of International Medical Scam.	Beneficiaries top pharma companies.		More Deaths, More Fear, More Profit.		Guys stay safe, do not overspend on masks and sanitizers. 		#jaishriram	#Carona 	#coronavirus 	#COVID2019 	#CoronaVirusUpdate 	#QuarantineHonestly believe that my sunburn from this week is going to be the death of me and not corona #coronavirus
Trust me,	#WhatsApp virus is dangerous than #CoronaVirus in India. ‚úçüèª‚úçüèª STAY SAFEGovernement has been asking Canadians to come home and avoid unecessary travels, what‚Äôs the point of suspending international flights &amp; closing of boarders if Canada is bringing them home at this point!!! We have 1000+ cases in the country #COVID19
People should be more worried about the financial collapse that will be happening than the #Covid_19 		A gun is better than no gun.Almost a month has passed since the quarantine in Japan. I‚Äôm not so scared of #coronavirus anymore, but getting scared ppl are so quiet here. There‚Äôs no longer a panic, an abuse, a line for the paper. But smth weird. I feel ppl are sunk into stress n have forgotten how to relax.
Postie said Royal Mail announced full pay &amp; no disciplinarians for excessive sick leave. Next day 13 at his depot called in sick. People been laid off, desperate for work &amp; others swinging the lead.  Despicable!  Don‚Äôt deserve jobs üò° #Covid_19Globally (as of now), there are 99,792 people who are totally recovered from #CoronaVirus but you aren‚Äôt told that
So in the US we had 80,000 people die from the flue last year alone. So we have a pandemic of 14,000 deaths GLOBALLY? I don't get it.  #CoronavirusEver more messages in my inbox from local companies that have to close, laying off workers and feebly hoping to reopen in the future.  Still not convinced this #coronavirus damage is justified. 	(no need to share your log-normal excel plots and 30 million dead scenarios)
No its not acceleratibg its a lie #CoronavirusInteresting how we're told if we stay inside that corona virus won't spread as much but they lowered airline tickets knowing DAMN WELL ppl will leave their homes ... 	to further spread it... 	interesting #coronavirus
arent you way more likely to die in prison from a zillion things over #coronavirus
If you ever been to county jail, you're immune to #coronavirusNew #Quarantine pickup line: "I'd risk #COVID19 to take you out."
I feel like i shouldnt have to pay my bills next month since im being treated like a teenager. Talkin bout sum 12 o clock curfew...üòë #COVID19 #QuarantineLifeEither kick off this zombie apocalypse or send my ass back to work this #CoronavirusPandemic is messing with my money.
Does anyone else get a sense we‚Äôre being bamboozled??? Where are the videos of overcrowded ERs? 	#coronavirus #CoronaHoaxFuck all yall I‚Äôm shitting outside from now on y‚Äôall wanna treat me like a caged animal I‚Äôll shit on you fuck off cunts #COVID19
