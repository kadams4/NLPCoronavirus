Is #2020 over yet? #Soleimani then #IranAttacks then #IranPlaneCrash weâ€™re all gonna die #WW3 no good v bad Cheeto coverage #ImpeachedForLife then #Kobi disaster and now #CoronavirusPandemic 		Weâ€™re not even at the Ides of March yet.
So I don't have a problem with #WuFlu, #wuhancoronvirus, #ChinaFlu etc tags for the #COVID19 virus as a descriptor.	I don't recall the #Spanish bitching and moaning for the last 100+ years about the #SpanishFlu, so perhaps neither should #China and people claiming #Sinophobia ðŸ™„
Don't worry about Tom Hanks, he's a rich hollywood elite, he'll be cured in under a week from his daily smoothies of innocent children's blood.		#TomHanks #Corona #CoronaVirusUpdate #CoronavirusPandemic #Covid_19
Yâ€™all remember the government and military was spotted transporting all those plastic coffin like things a while back. Well now we know why. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£#CoronavirusPandemic
Do you support government funded testing and healthcare for those with #Covid19 #Coronavirus?		If no, please reply with what percentage of humans would have to die before you would?So my next #Covid_19 observation, all these politicians, sports stars and actors test positive for the #coronavirus but not one of them is in the hospital or even showing signs of being sick. So when do the sick people show up?
The country will come to a stop until ppl realize the #FakeNews  with #Democrats behind scaring everyone. Thy put ppl in a panic so they can wreck the  #Trump  Economy. Itâ€™s all about hitting Trump for the Presidency.  #CoronaOutbreak is real but #politics caused Panic #Covid_19
I feel like at the end of all of this we will find out that this whole #coronavirus problem somehow was Antonio Brownâ€™s fault #stillsour
The government is collecting our ðŸ§¬ DNA + developing human DNA bank of course. #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaOutbreak
Why don't people just Google 'incurable viruses' and the read the many they are and then realise that alot of this is being blow out of proportion! We live with viruses every day and deal with it...media scaremongering! #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdate #CoronavirusPandemicThe media is the true virus, it's infecting people more than anything. Some more than others. #COVID19 #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdates
We need toilet paper and Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to go to the store and see that all the idiot doomsday preppers bought it all. Way to shit all over my Saturday #COVID19
Lot of shit going on right now.  A lot of it is really dumb.  Absolutely no one asked and absolutely no one cares....but my advice?  Be kind to one another and love the people you love fiercely.  Give and get hugs freely and act as a beacon of joy in an angry world 	#Covid_19
I think I'm going to die faster from a #hangover than #coronavirus
So New York has had its 1st death, its very first one from #COVID19.  The victim was 82 years old and had been "long suffering" with emphysema.  I am middle aged, very healthy, train daily, non-smoker with zero underlying health issues.  Im not in the least bit worried about my..I refuse to let anyone make me feel bad for not panicking and freaking out about #coronavirus.		I can be alert and sensible without acting like it's the end of the world or that '10x more deadly than flu' is anything other than 'not really that deadly', thanks.
Apparently West Virginians are immune to the #coronavirus. Must be in their genes.
Be prepared for the unexpected #COVID19
Anyone to blame for this #COVIDãƒ¼19 spread is China. Hiding this for 2 months and keeping doctors quiet to alert others to prepare and close borders faster. #coronavirusHear me out- werenâ€™t people dying from a mysterious vaping disease a few months ago that affected the lungs? Is that still a thing too? #coronavirus
If this shit lasts till July or August Iâ€™m going to flip my shit!!!!!! My husband needs to come back from deployment and these kids need to be in school! #coronavirus
Some potential #coronavirus stats;	First of all the predicted #Infection rates have been wildly estimated at anything between 1% - 80% of the total population. And the current #mortality rate of 'closed' cases sits at 8% (granted, this doesn't include non-reported cases)...
how have they cancelled my work experience and sent all of us kids back to school because of the coronavirus, isnâ€™t  that a bit stupid iâ€™m pretty sure iâ€™m more likely to get the virus in school than at work experienceðŸ˜¡ #Covid19Walkout #coronavirus#CoronaVirus is the longest lasting thing coming from china!! ðŸ˜†
I'm still hoping to wake up and all of this Corona virus stuff to have been one big deliberate prank to finally get all of you dirty bastards to wash your hands.	#Corvid19uk #coronavirus
Aparently it doesnt kill rich people.. #coronavirus
More people should be aware of what the world is ACTUALLY doing behind this #coronavirus distraction. Whatâ€™s happening behind the scenes? The virus is real. However ask the questions! Why now? Is it actually created and released? Research people. Donâ€™t be a sheep!No disrespect but is there a connection between #Kobe and the #coronavirus As in he didn't really die...like the Elvis conspiracy? Think back to what was going on January 26th. Weird but anything's possible I suppose or maybe I've got #cabinfever
Americans are still crying over #COVID19 while the Chinese are free and clear of the #CoronavirusPandemic  #wakeupamericans yâ€™all are stupid
I'm a very reasonable and realistic person. I've looked at all the data and based on the reaction to this #COVID19 	Pandemic. 		The reaction is not adding up.	Not even close.
Government forcing private businesses to shut down and/or forcing individuals to stay in their homes is tyranny whether thereâ€™s a pandemic or not. #COVID19 #COVID19ohio#COVID19 alot has to be said for the way the media portrays the news in such events. Releases &amp; headlines should be vetted to curb the propaganda.  The resulting situation of the economy caused in part by #coronavirus is going to be far worse than the problem we are trying to fix
Fear of economic slow down due to corona virus supersedes all other major events like subprime crisis, note bandi, Greece and Brexit etc		Is there a real problem which market is trying to discount or its panic? Only time will tell.		#Markets #marketselloff #Covid19#coronavirus conspiracy theory:	- people of 70 years and older are the most exposed to be dead from #Corona 	- their children are 40-50 years old and these people vote	- if parents die, children are pissed off and no votes	- hence - fight #coronavirus!I don't wish to appear flippant but as it stands I'm genuinely at more risk from gout than #Covid_19 . #SocialDistancingJust got turned away to hike a mountainðŸ˜• #socialdistance #covid19Itâ€™s with profound respect for anyone whoâ€™s lost someone already, (and anyone who will lose someone) I sayâ€”		societyâ€™s cure may wind up being worse than the disease ...	#coronavirus #Covid_19This #Covid19usa #Coronavirus propaganda is too much!Interesting how we're told if we stay inside that corona virus won't spread as much but they lowered airline tickets knowing DAMN WELL ppl will leave their homes ... 	to further spread it... 	interesting #coronavirus
Here's a truth you won't like.		This 'pandemic' isn't a real emergency.		It's a mild flu for 90% of people - most of who won't know they have it.		The biggest threat is the scum media whipping up hysteria.		#CoronavirusLockdown #COVIDIDIOTS #Covid19Out #21daysLockdown #COVID19this is the first service Iâ€™ve missed in almost 6 years and I AM NOT HAPPY BOUT IT!		I WANT MY 1ST AMENDMENT BACK!		if they told you to give up your 2nd amendment for public safety there would be another civil war!		#covid19andthechurch #coronavirusAll these attempts to control us and take our rights in the name of fighting #coronavirus will only awaken more people to their tyranny!  We Americans have never bowed to a disease or tyrants and we wonâ€™t start now!This staying at home not goin to work for me. #coronavirus #StayHome #lockdown #outlaw  #WashYourHands
