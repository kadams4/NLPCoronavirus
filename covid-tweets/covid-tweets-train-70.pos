Virus carriers may not show symptoms of #Covid_19 for as long as 14 days, and in the meantime they‚Äôre potentially spreading germs. The bottom line is that this is such a new virus, there is just a lot we don‚Äôt yet know. I‚Äôd rather err on the side of caution to protect our public.
Many crucial moments have come and gone in the decision timelines of world leaders. As the mounting data suggests, most countries have responded with too little, too late. Perhaps it‚Äôs time for a data scientist as president. #CoronavirusPandemic #Wisdom #dreaming #COVID19

The USA is still taking a reactive approach the #COVID19 instead of a proactive approach.  Communities need to be tested immediately.  Containment should be implemented across the board, meaning the public needs to immediately take measures to stop community spread of the virus.

Guys lot of countries are under lockdown. Its time we fill up our refrigerator with food, stock enough groceries and disinfectants for home. Shortly we are going to get 2 week work from home notice #coronavirusindia #pandemic #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus
(2/3) Maximum cases are people with a travel history to infected countries and ofcourse Italians. 65 infected and 0 deaths for a billion people is simply amazing statistics.		Can someone figure out why the #CoronavirusOutbreak hasn't hit India as hard as other nations?
When I tried to alarm people around me because I saw how bad it was in China two months ago. They say: don‚Äôt worry that‚Äôs China. Now: WORSE than China in every aspect. Still ü§¨ how everywhere else has extra months to prepare and now it‚Äôs pandemic. #COVID19 #COVID2019NL
It's already here. Trump can't waive #COVID19 away with another travel ban. Where are the test kits? #TrumpAddress

1/x Tips for coping with #Covid_19 anxiety. 1) take good self-care measures for health 2) wash hands regularly per CDC guidelines 3) limit social media use &amp; checking the news (ex: no more than 30 min a day, or check news once a day) 4) avoid ritualistic behaviors #CBTWorks
All you Spring Breakers, stay safe and don‚Äôt bring anything back to the 806! As far as we know, Lubbock is coronavirus-less. But that could all change in a matter of weeks. #COVID19
the US is handling this #COVID19 so poorly
This past week has literally felt like a nightmare. #CoronavirusPandemic
Aware of the panic and all about the likely lockdown--It would do everyone good if we not only think of our own health, but also of the welfare of our families and communities. We might (unknowingly) spread the #COVID19, so please avoid travelling.
IF IN DOUBT?		GET CHECKED OUT!		#cornoravirusuk #COVID19 		If not for yourself, but for every child, parent grandparent, uncle or aunty who could catch it or pass it on to someone vulnerable
We are in this together #Covid_19 #coronavirusIs anyone in the general population reacting a normal amount to #coronavirus ?	Like not making it a complete joke OR buying 8 packs of TP.
So, stay indoors for 14 day, I probably won‚Äôt get paid for it, but I understand. But wait, this thing is world wide in warm weather climates, so it probably won‚Äôt just go away. And everything I‚Äôve read says you can keep getting it. I‚Äôm fine with a quarantine, than what? #COVID_19
All UNR classes moved online following our spring break. This is a good move by the university! Thankful to work for an employer who values us and our students, and recognizes this situation for what it is: an emergency. #COVID19 #UNR

Hey people, no need to panic. Just practice proper hygiene. If you have a chronic illness, stay away from people. Don't visit our seniors in long-term care facilities. They're vulnerable. JUST USE COMMON SENSE and stop hoarding TP and Lysol wipes. #Covid_19 #CoronavirusPandemic
Guys, we have to stop looking to our federal government for answers. There are none. If you can, stay home. Keep your kids home. Build your immunity. 		This is a great time to develop your hustle. #CoronavirusPandemic

The conference I was meant to go to in a couple weeks has been cancelled because of #Covid_19 		However it‚Äôs likely for the best, as my family are part of the high risk populations. It‚Äôs not worth the potential risk from being at a large and international event
Churches in U.K. are still gathering despite churches in America live streaming services and many large public gatherings globally being cancelled. Why are they not taking the safety of their congregations seriously and acting now? #CoronavirusPandemic

Don`t panic but take it seriously. Let`s fight both the virus and the anxiety. We all wish to stay home but life must go on. Protect the entry points. All the more your hands and your soul. Also sentido kumon. #Covid_19

Imagine if #COVID19 lasts for longer. Has anybody detailed the consequences to countries economy and to ordinary people. No work, no traveling, no money, no food, and then?
Social distancing and canceling schools/events is of course inconvenient, but so is possibly giving #Covid_19 to someone with a compromised immune system. Canceling/rescheduling events is not over dramatic. It‚Äôs saving lives like mine.
Gas prices going down is not a good thing, guys... hundreds, if not thousands, of oil field families are losing their jobs and subsequently their livelihood. This #Covid_19 virus isn‚Äôt just effecting folks through contracting illness. Worldwide spread panic is also a virus.

Everyone needs to understand the basic principles of public health, particularly that health is social. #COVID19 is showing that we have a long way to go on this front. This is so important that basic public health needs to be incorporated into every high school curriculum.
Confused?  Why do u need a test to confirm your symptoms? If u think u have #COVID19, quarantine yourself.  There's no treatment you're missing out on.  If you're case is really serious, go to a hospital.

Maybe it's not all about how to not get infected by #COVID19. Just assume you're the carrier so you should lessen your touch to things, your travel, and contacts with people to slower the spread and no more COVID19 left in the world since the virus only have days to live.

Stay the hell home, people! Ur not doing this for you‚Äîyou‚Äôre doing it for those who will die if they get #coronavirus. Don‚Äôt be a selfish asshole and go to the mall so you can buy another MAC lipstick. You might even have it, not feel sick and spread this #virus. #StayTheFHome
Next person that rolls their eyes because we're concerned about #coronavirus gets a full on butt punch. The grocery store we go to just confirmed one of their employees tested positive. When it gets closer to your family, I'll happily remind you that it's stupid to be concerned.
I very happy to see that with the fear of the #coronavirus, food security is not being forgotten. We are working hard to make sure our students are supported and they never have to worry about their next meal
may we make it easier for the authorities to control it, and may all of us especially the doctors, nurses, medical officers &amp; volunteers etc. be protected from this viral sickness. inshaAllah. #covid_19

I‚Äôm proud of my home. Portugal has taken the right preventative measures at the right time. 		Meanwhile The Netherlands is still out here playing. Bars, clubs and restaurants were full last night.

final thoughts for today on #coronavirus is assume it‚Äôs on everything and that everyone has it. It‚Äôs almost impossible to not touch stuff between hand hygiene and eating as an example. Maintain 2 metres between everyone and stop being self conscious about reminding people as much

What is LA doing about all those homeless folks now that we have the #coronavirus outbreak?
Two friends just contracted #coronavirus unknowingly and have to self-quarantine. We took him groceries and left them outside the door. We live in a rural area. Be safe everyone.

I feel like the United States' response to this pandemic was: plugging its ears, closing its eyes, and yelling "lalalala". And then this week, the United States finally opened its eyes and was like "shoot, that usually works. There goes plan A, B, and C!" #coronavirus #COVID19

The best way to control the spread of #COVID19 is: 1. Pray vigoursly to seek forgiveness and protection from God. 2. Adopt cleanliness measures to the extent as if u have the virus to protect others from it and as if everyone else have a virus  to protect yourselves from it.

It is duty of all citizens to educate population not to move not to #travel as news are coming that many people are moving back to there hometowns . If we stay indoor we can win #CoronaVirus
Observations: Older / at risk not getting the message. Couples walking round Tesco, too close to everyone. No concept of keeping back at counters or tills. And bizarrely, parents with children going shopping? Why? Lock the country down, some people can't be educated  #Covid_19
As the saying goes, Prevention is better than cure, sadly there is no cure available for #CoronaVirus so we are only left with prevention.		So please take serious preventive measures and stay safe !!		#CoronaVirusPakistan

Peoples inability to distance themselves socially is absolutely mind blowing. Temporarily isolating ourselves could mean all this being over in time for the summer. Thousands of life's saved. Surely people can go a few weeks chilling in the gaff ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #Covid_19

It‚Äôs a massacre in Italy among the elderly born before 1940. They were kids playing when the bombs were falling during the war, the ones that built our Republic. We need to find a way to protect them. Other countries should do the same to shield that precious generation #COVID19

Having spoken to and read accounts from varying healthcare professionals in various places, it's clear that what our leadership is telling us is and will be happening is not the reality of what is actually happening. Coordination is shoddy and haphazard. #Covid_19 #Coronavirus

It‚Äôs scarier that the reports of how many new people have #Covid_19 are essentially a week old because of how long it takes to get the results. Literally thousands could have it in Ireland right now and we wouldn‚Äôt even know.

Everyone: STAY PUT. DON‚ÄôT LEAVE THE HOUSE! 		Grocery store websites: all this food is only available for in-store pick up. 		#gofuckyourself #corona #covid19
My motto for 2020 absolutely do nothing but stay home. #lockdown #COVID19 #StayHome
Those of you worried about money during a global pandemic are forgetting this one simple fact. That money won‚Äôt follow you to the grave. #HowToEnd_CoronaPandemic #lockdown #LockdownNow #COVID19 #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus #pandemic
By all means stay safe. Let's stop the spread of the #Coronavirus. It'll take individual effort to fight this and yes, we will win this fight together.
Do not listen to politicians who recommend drugs for a disease. Listen to the doctors. Listen to the experts. #Covid19 #Coronavirus #LKA #QuarantineLife #Quarantine
The response to COVID-19 has only showed me that the US and UK safe like the two kids in the class always getting in trouble and getting detention because they don‚Äôt listen #medtwitter #COVID19
We are all getting done over by the most microscopic piece of bacteria because people are stupid and won‚Äôt stay in their house and then putting others and the more vulnerable at risk... the world is full of selfish peopleüò¢ #coronavirus #covidiots
Those who are privilege enough to sustain their daily needs in a month or even months of being quarantine, all of their worries are that they are bored, want to go outside, meet their friends, travel etc. #COVID19PH #Covid_19

Tales from a first responder/ health care worker at the front of the #COVID19 pandemic: 		Social distancing is still not stopping strangers from asking me to look at a mole on their groin in the gas station bathroom.

Part 4: Since the U.S. and Canada have agreed to lockdown their borders due to the #Coronavirus, perhaps it's time for us here in the U.S. to consider locking down our nation altogether, and give a 1-week notice to Americans abroad to return home, to prevent any further outbreak.

#BREAKING: A woman in her 30s has died in the City of St. Louis from #COVID19. This is the first death in the city. This is again a reminder that ANY one, of ANY age, can be impacted by #coronavirus.
The problem with this country, is that we don't take anything seriously. We didn't take Brexit seriously, we didn't take the general election seriously, when voting. Now, we don't take #COVID19 seriously. Wake the fuck up people - this is not a joke! #StayAtHome
Just arrived at Gatwick from Sri Lanka (essentially a third world country) their measures against #coronavirus are infinitely better than ours on the basis ours don‚Äôt exist. Tells you all you need to know about Gov attitude to this. UK need to wake up fast!!

Some people be taking this #CoronaVirus serious on social media but when u tell them to cover their mouth when they cough in public, they wanna fight.
Stay where you are.		Because of this Curfew/Lock down people are fleeing to their natives.		This will increase the spread from metropolitan cities to rural remote locations.		Kindly don't act as carriers and take this virus to the rural areas of the country.		#Covid19	#Corona

I'm so glad I live in the UK and we have the NHS because in America it looks like truly a shit show #coronavirus #coronavirusuk
Canada needs to go on a total lockdown now. Clearly we are showing we can‚Äôt follow instructions. This is what governments do...look out for people when they need help. Well we need help. Shut everything down. #COVID19

Chatted with some religious people and they strongly believe that religion can protect them from Covid19. Yes/maybe but extra caution won‚Äôt hurt. It‚Äôs time we use social influencers such as religious, indigenous leaders, etc to convey the safety message #SocialDistancing #COVID19

The President and GOP lawmakers calling on workers to go back to work after next week is an insane policy. Not only will it result in a vastly higher death toll than sustained shelter-in-place, the economy will STILL tank if millions get sick. #COVID19

As a pharmacy tech that has patients, friends, &amp; family on forms of chloroquine/hydroxychloriquine for legitimate reasons, I'm gonna put this bluntly: folks taking/hoarding these medications &amp; the doctors prescribing them for off-label use to treat #COVID19  should be ashamed.
It honestly astounds me that people are still going out and socialising with others outside their household. 		Stop being selfish. Stop putting the NHS under more strain. Stop putting people at risk. 		All together now: STOPüëèBEINGüëèSELFISHüëè		#COVID19 #CoronavirusLockdown

The best solution to fight the #COVID19 pandemic in Cameroon is a total lockdown. If things get worse, we neither have the infrastructure, nor the money, nor the expertise, and looking at the behavior of some top state officials, we might not even have the goodwill to fight it.

At the current time the #UK is still in full exponential growth of #COVID19. However it locked down so in 2 weeks it will begin to slow. Please, all people worldwide, please enter full lockdown. If we ignore lockdown, we will have at least 20% mortality, 38% next year.#extinction
I still work. Going to this wedding puts me and everyone around me at risk. This hurts so badly because the one time they want me to be there for them....I can‚Äôt go. I won‚Äôt be able to work. I can get others sick. It‚Äôs tearing me apart. #coronavirus #covid19 #wedding #lockdown
IF YOU DECIDE TO GO OUT, AND YOU GET INFECTED, YOU WILL PROPAGATE A CHAIN OF INFECTION THAT ULTIMATELY KILLS 9 PEOPLE. How is this message not being delivered more clearly? #coronavirus #coronavirusaustralia
so it is very important to stay home and not relate to nobody, being very careful is very important and very crucial. From March 23 to April 3 we must take care of ourselves as we will be at the peak of the virus, two weeks, 2/ #COVID19 #ukcoronavirus #UKlockdown
We all have a national tragedy we remember from our childhood...I'm sad my children have this to remember. Having to explain to them why they can't go to the fence to say hi to the neighbors really blows! #coronavirus #SocialDistancing
my parents are getting a quarantine korgi.  but i cant go see it because of self-isolating. a new hatred for #coronavirus was born today.
Also, to those idiots who refused to stay home for spring break bc you planned it for so long, I don‚Äôt feel sorry for any of you. At this point, that‚Äôs just natural selection. #COVID19 #SocialDistanacing #CongratulationsAmerica #springbreakidiots #dontlistentotrump #StayTheFHome
Once it goes out it sells out fast. This is like Black Friday. Just please social distance. Go only for the essential items and please don't browse around cause your bored.	The virus is very serious and we need to get ahead of it 3/3	#coronavirus #SocialDistanacing #StayHome
Also to anyone chasing, use your head Saturday. With everything going on with #COVID19 and the possibility of this being a bigger day, I expect a lot of people to be out. Don‚Äôt gather in large groups and continue to social distance.
Can y'all please just follow the government instructions so we can knock this coronavirus out and be done? I feel like a kindergartner that keeps loosing more recess time because one or two kids can't follow directions. üôÑüòû #COVID2019 #COVID19 #StayHome

A couple of sobering facts:		1) If you die of COVID-19, you die alone with carers dressed in spacesuits! 		2) You get buried in your pyjamas or your hospital robes! 		3) Healthy, young people are NOT immune!		Now STAY THE FUCK INSIDE!! #coronavirus #StayHomeSaveLives

Staying home and self quarantining is not even remotely possible for those who are homeless. Which is why it falls on us as citizens of the world to SPEAK UP and DEMAND our elected officials take clear concise measures to assist the most vulnerable members of society #coronavirus
It‚Äôs sad to see, read &amp; hear that ppl only take the #coronavirus serious if it hits close to home. If they don‚Äôt personally know someone with the illness or if they feel well, they don‚Äôt care. Or, some are in straight denial leading to some reckless decisions &amp; costing lives. Smh
