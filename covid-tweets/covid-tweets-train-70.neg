I‚Äôm just going to say it- I‚Äôm SO sick of hearing abt this stupid, over exaggerated virus. So we can‚Äôt go anywhere or do anything because everything is closed, and if we stay home, using TP as an armchair, we can‚Äôt even watch sports! Might as well kill me #CoronavirusPandemic

All of this social distancing to avoid #coronavirus is going to lead to people drinking by themselves and being lonely. Fortunately for me I‚Äôve been practicing for this moment for years.

The #coronavirus #COVID19  mainly affects old white people ( and people with compromised immune systems) and since the powers-that-be are white, that's why they've been panicking cuz this could literally take them out and change the power structure all over the world.

We're not going to let the #coronavirus keep us from doing what we always do on St. Paddy's day.
What shits me about this whole #coronavirus is that doomsday preppers are going to think they‚Äôre right. I guess they won‚Äôt have trouble self isolating though since no one wants to be around them.

Aparently it doesnt kill rich people.. #coronavirus
More people will be affected by the fall out from all this scaremongering than will be from the #coronavirus itself. It is deeply saddening, however on the scale it is nothing in comparison to other illnesses/diseases. Tell me, what is the underlying reason behind all this shit?
#CoronaVirus is the longest lasting thing coming from china!! üòÜ
More people should be aware of what the world is ACTUALLY doing behind this #coronavirus distraction. What‚Äôs happening behind the scenes? The virus is real. However ask the questions! Why now? Is it actually created and released? Research people. Don‚Äôt be a sheep!
China released this on the world and they are not helping at all. They are holding back all information on the outbreak. They must be removed as a member of the WTO. Bring our manufacturing back to the USA! #Coronavirus

From my one module in Epidemiology in University I think I'm well placed to give my advice on the current pandemic which is..		'Wipe your lip and get on with it.'		You may return to your duties.		#coronavirus #covid19UK #COVID19 #giveover
Another day of the shop being a quarter full, another day of people asking why, its going to be like groundhog day for a few weeks #coronavirus I'm going to try and start a different conversation today as I'm giving up the will to live
I firmly now believe that #coronavirus is not what it seems and in fact the current behaviour by the elected elite is actually much more sinister.		Are they crashing economies globally on purpose so as to eventually ignite global growth.		Things are not adding up.
Restaurants can take away their seating but that's not gunna stop me from sitting on the floor #coronavirus
I'm a very reasonable and realistic person. I've looked at all the data and based on the reaction to this #COVID19 	Pandemic. 		The reaction is not adding up.	Not even close.
You have got children crying their eyes out because they can't sit their GCSEs 	My niece doesn't want her predictive grades as she wanted to actually sit them.	Months she has been preparing herself	#fuckyou #covid19UK #schoolclosuresuk #coronavirus #pisstake
Not normally a conspiratard, but can't help thinking the #coronavirus panic is a priming exercise for the shutdown of economic growth deemed necessary in order to "combat climate change". Either that or an extraordinary dovetailing of aims.
Honestly at this point more people are going to die from the response to the virus than the actual virus itself. And that‚Äôs scary. #coronavirus
I have this weird feeling that this is a VERY over dramatic way to try and reduce the impact on climate change... The press have fallen for it. The governments have fallen for it. Bet Greta Iceberg is rubbing her hands in glee at the thought of no travel! #coronavirus #COVID19

Why is coronavirus a big deal?! In public wear a mask and always carry hand sanitizer with you not butt load just the amount you need.		And always wash and rince vegetables when you get home. It's not so hard #coronavirus #coronavirustips
The #coronavirus is a scam!! Africa and India are not shutting down and they are doing fine! Wake up!!!
Glad that #Belgium gave us a soft #lockdown with #SocialDistancing cause we get to still go out and #workout on our ownor with 2 #Coronavirus 	Hope it doesn't get worst!
84383+ patients of corona have recovered worldwide. Let us spread the good news and positivity.	Faith over Fear.üòá		#CoronaInPakistan #COVID19#COVID19 alot has to be said for the way the media portrays the news in such events. Releases &amp; headlines should be vetted to curb the propaganda.  The resulting situation of the economy caused in part by #coronavirus is going to be far worse than the problem we are trying to fix
I refuse to panic about #coronavirus until it‚Äôs death count surpasses the Clinton‚Äôs
I‚Äôm not at all worried about getting sick from this stupid #coronavirus but I am worried about businesses closing, events getting postponed, supplies running low and all these crazy changes that affecting everyone‚Äôs lives
Fear of economic slow down due to corona virus supersedes all other major events like subprime crisis, note bandi, Greece and Brexit etc		Is there a real problem which market is trying to discount or its panic? Only time will tell.		#Markets #marketselloff #Covid19
I‚Äôm so annoyed with all the celebrities asking everyone to stay home until things get better! It‚Äôs easy for them to do it, not for the rest of us who don‚Äôt have the means to do so.	#coronavirus #celebrityannoyins
The weekend is upon us &amp; I am itching to go out since I was responsible due to #COVID19 last weekend. I wanna have a social distancing happy hour with my neighbors but they old as fuuuuck üôÉ
You can literally create a flu by yourself just by thinking about it.. 		These spin doctors know all about the laws of attraction &amp; that's the weapon they are using against humans, an attack on their biology via consciousness information manipulation.	#COVID19	#CoronaVirusUpdate
People are taking this thing way too seriously it's getting out of control. #coronavirus #COVID19 #ChineseVirus
If I hear one more person start their press release/email/meeting with "it's business as usual" I might just lose it. 	I don't care where you are or what you do, nothing about this is "usual".		#covid19 #flattenthecurve #stayhome
Carona is a perfect example of International Medical Scam.	Beneficiaries top pharma companies.		More Deaths, More Fear, More Profit.		Guys stay safe, do not overspend on masks and sanitizers. 		#jaishriram	#Carona 	#coronavirus 	#COVID2019 	#CoronaVirusUpdate 	#Quarantine
The #pandemic is the panic , not the #coronavirus  #COVID19
Instead of "#flatteningthecurve" and prolonging our misery, let's just "rip off the band-aid" and get this over with! Long term stressing of hospitals is worse than a short term spike. And it's killing the economy. #COVID19
Hi virus,	You will never be able to touch me 	#COVID19#coronavirus conspiracy theory:	- people of 70 years and older are the most exposed to be dead from #Corona 	- their children are 40-50 years old and these people vote	- if parents die, children are pissed off and no votes	- hence - fight #coronavirus!
Take the #coronavirus seriously, but don‚Äôt lose your mind over it. 		While some people are vulnerable to it, yes, 90% of people that catch it will make a recovery without a problem.
I'm I only one who isn't panicking an thinks this is all a bit much? Also check out the new powers the state has given itself of the back of the #CoronaCrisis #Covid_19 #coronavirus
So..... is there more to this than ‚Äòthey‚Äôre‚Äô letting on? #coronavirus #CoronaCrisis
Trust me,	#WhatsApp virus is dangerous than #CoronaVirus in India. ‚úçüèª‚úçüèª STAY SAFE
My father is 67 years old and is still going to work every day! #realmvp #Covid_19
Honestly believe that my sunburn from this week is going to be the death of me and not corona #coronavirus
Covid-19 i gonna leave more people bankrupt and dead from suicide (when people lose their job, savings, home) than actual deaths from the virus...		#COVID19 #CoronaCouldn't tell ya why golf courses are closed. Being outside and roughly 200-400 yds away from other people at all times seems like a good way to not transmit the ol Wuhan ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #StayAtHome #CoronavirusPandemic #COVID„Éº19
Governement has been asking Canadians to come home and avoid unecessary travels, what‚Äôs the point of suspending international flights &amp; closing of boarders if Canada is bringing them home at this point!!! We have 1000+ cases in the country #COVID19
#hongkongflu was worse and the world got through it - we will get through this #Covid_19
I don't wish to appear flippant but as it stands I'm genuinely at more risk from gout than #Covid_19 . #SocialDistancing
I dunno if Dr. Fauci is a "deep state plant" and all, but I do know this... Have you ever tried to get a straight answer from your doctor?? They hedge, and then they hedge the hedge. They are master hedgers, unwilling to be pinned down. üòÅ #ThankYouPresidentTrump #COVID19
In California it‚Äôs legal to give someone AIDS without them knowing, shit on the streets, steal from stores &amp; kill a baby but if you want to play a game of 5 on 5 basketball at the park your ass is going to jail. #Covid_19 #CoronaCrisis #Quaratine #MartialLaw #californiashutdownPostie said Royal Mail announced full pay &amp; no disciplinarians for excessive sick leave. Next day 13 at his depot called in sick. People been laid off, desperate for work &amp; others swinging the lead.  Despicable!  Don‚Äôt deserve jobs üò° #Covid_19
Just got turned away to hike a mountainüòï #socialdistance #covid19
Almost a month has passed since the quarantine in Japan. I‚Äôm not so scared of #coronavirus anymore, but getting scared ppl are so quiet here. There‚Äôs no longer a panic, an abuse, a line for the paper. But smth weird. I feel ppl are sunk into stress n have forgotten how to relax.
I‚Äôm not tryna be a conspiracy theorist here.. I know ppl are getting sick and everyone is trying to self isolate. But there‚Äôs something bigger in the works #covid19 #CoronaVirus .. maybe it‚Äôs just me, I‚Äôm trippin ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
#Coronavirus #Covid19 #Covid_19 is a #scam. Why?	Most deaths are old people and with pre-diseases (cancer, hypertension,...etc) which can all cause death.	Death rates are inflated bcos of the detection sample driven by old people who visit hospitals regulary vs young ones.It‚Äôs with profound respect for anyone who‚Äôs lost someone already, (and anyone who will lose someone) I say‚Äî		society‚Äôs cure may wind up being worse than the disease ...	#coronavirus #Covid_19
Globally (as of now), there are 99,792 people who are totally recovered from #CoronaVirus but you aren‚Äôt told that
Don't get me wrong. #COVID19 is serious. 15,328 dead globally.		However, there are more homicides per year in the U.S. alone -- and "flattening the curve" doesn't apply to murder. (1/3)		#coronavirus #COVID„Éº19
I wonder if #COVID19 discriminates? Just bc I'm not 65 or barely breathing I can't get tested. Great job American doctors. I'll just continue going to work and try to act like I don't feel like absolute shit.
I think the electric waves are the reason.üòÜ	#Covid_19 #physicsYall want me to preach "We over Me" now? But when black people are shot my police officers its "oh well lol" when poor people are kicked out on the street because they cant pay bills its "lol get a better job" nah fuck your elderly and fuck your fear. #Coronavirus
I‚Äôm thinking how did we get here? #COVID19 is brining the world to it‚Äôs knees and sinking it to a financial depression. I say it‚Äôs the news media with its fear mongering, promotion of hysteria, and their hatred of #realDonaldTrump
It‚Äôs no surprise that when the republicans need a distraction for their bullshit that trump says the dumbest Shit ever. #sideshow #ropeadope #distraction #coronavirus #letsOpenUpTheEconomy #DumbAssTrump
This #Covid19usa #Coronavirus propaganda is too much!
Wtf (what the flip) is this whole #coronavirus thing and why did it happen hereHumans are house arrested  by #Coronavirus		its a republic day for all other animals 		#CoronavirusLockdown 	#Valimai
If the United States doesn‚Äôt start it‚Äôs economy back up within a week, it will be devastating. We are witnessing the deaths of our freedom, our free market and the dollar. Socialism is a worse virus than  #COVID19.
As of right now. Worldwide chances of getting the virus are 0.005% and chances of dying are 0.0002%. What pandemic?? üòÇüòÇ #coronavirus #COVIDIDIOTS #COVID19 #Trump2020 #KAG #FakeNews #pandemic

Less than 0.001% of the UK‚Äôs population has the #coronavirus
I‚Äôm still not seeing a pandemic. I do see a seasonal virus out break like every year.	Is this now going to be a yearly event? Shutdown 4 a couple months because people catch the flu &amp; die? Not to be harsh but the numbers are just not adding up.		#coronavirus #CoronavirusLockdown
arent you way more likely to die in prison from a zillion things over #coronavirus
In the US, smoking kills more than 480k annually,  40k die in car accidents, 5Ok die from suicide, 80k die from diabetes, more than 50k died from flu last year.  We should take #Covid19 serious but we are losing our minds when the death rate will likely be under flu. Its 809 now.
Interesting how we're told if we stay inside that corona virus won't spread as much but they lowered airline tickets knowing DAMN WELL ppl will leave their homes ... 	to further spread it... 	interesting #coronavirus
I don't stress over media hoaxes. #coronavirus
please everyone stop consistently telling ppl to stay inside, its demeaning and creating the impression that you are better than me		I'd like to go to work &amp; get food 4 my family without the feeling of being judged by ppl behind curtains		#coronavirus	#StayHomeOpen the economy back up and let the weak fall. #Covid19Out #coronavirus #TrumpPressConf #CoronavirusLockdown #COVID2019 #ChineseVirus #PatriotsAwakened

this is the first service I‚Äôve missed in almost 6 years and I AM NOT HAPPY BOUT IT!		I WANT MY 1ST AMENDMENT BACK!		if they told you to give up your 2nd amendment for public safety there would be another civil war!		#covid19andthechurch #coronavirusIs there a cure for the flu? No theres a vaccine. If you get the vaccine and come across a person with the flu you are still going to get the flu. Same with the  #Coronavirus theres going to be ALOT of people who get it but i feel our immune systems need to beat it one its own.
Does anyone else get a sense we‚Äôre being bamboozled??? Where are the videos of overcrowded ERs? 	#coronavirus #CoronaHoax
