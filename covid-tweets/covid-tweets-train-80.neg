Dear EVERYONE in the media, unless you are an EXPERT on the coronavirus, this is what we want to hear from you. "I don't know anything in regards to the coronavirus, so I'm going to talk about ________, and leave that to the experts."	#CoronavirusPandemic 	#sensationalism
So I don't have a problem with #WuFlu, #wuhancoronvirus, #ChinaFlu etc tags for the #COVID19 virus as a descriptor.	I don't recall the #Spanish bitching and moaning for the last 100+ years about the #SpanishFlu, so perhaps neither should #China and people claiming #Sinophobia üôÑ

#CoronavirusPandemic is trending because the media is pushing it for rating to make money on commercial time slots. They want you to panic and tune in for the latest.

a doctor can diagnosis somebody who has a regular cold with having the corona virus it's no different then how they diagnosis people with having hpv when they just have an allergic reaction to something they are eating they don't care about your health  #Covid_19

I‚Äôm just going to say it- I‚Äôm SO sick of hearing abt this stupid, over exaggerated virus. So we can‚Äôt go anywhere or do anything because everything is closed, and if we stay home, using TP as an armchair, we can‚Äôt even watch sports! Might as well kill me #CoronavirusPandemic

Why don't people just Google 'incurable viruses' and the read the many they are and then realise that alot of this is being blow out of proportion! We live with viruses every day and deal with it...media scaremongering! #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdate #CoronavirusPandemic
My predictions for The Great American Flu, or COVID-19:	- This will all be over in roughly 2-3 weeks, with a similar bell curve to China	- The NBA season will resume after 30 days, cancelling all remaining regular season games and preceding into the playoffs.	#CoronavirusPandemic

What is it with people being scared of corona it‚Äôs a great drink #Covid_19
Imagine not wanting coronavirus if you're below 60, minimal death rate, 2 weeks off work in isolation may I add. You were all begging for extra bank holidays few weeks back #CoronavirusPandemic

Can we rename the #CoronaVirus to #MoronAVirus?	Because that seems to be the main symptom now. Everyone has become an idiot.
All of this social distancing to avoid #coronavirus is going to lead to people drinking by themselves and being lonely. Fortunately for me I‚Äôve been practicing for this moment for years.

At this point, I‚Äôm more worried about the COVID-19 panic than the virus itself. Everything is closing soon. Our society is overreacting to this virus. 	#coronavirus
More people should be aware of what the world is ACTUALLY doing behind this #coronavirus distraction. What‚Äôs happening behind the scenes? The virus is real. However ask the questions! Why now? Is it actually created and released? Research people. Don‚Äôt be a sheep!
China released this on the world and they are not helping at all. They are holding back all information on the outbreak. They must be removed as a member of the WTO. Bring our manufacturing back to the USA! #Coronavirus
I'm still hoping to wake up and all of this Corona virus stuff to have been one big deliberate prank to finally get all of you dirty bastards to wash your hands.	#Corvid19uk #coronavirus

I firmly now believe that #coronavirus is not what it seems and in fact the current behaviour by the elected elite is actually much more sinister.		Are they crashing economies globally on purpose so as to eventually ignite global growth.		Things are not adding up.
The odd truth about the #coronavirus is that it appears to have about a 1 in 50 chance of killing you.  Most black men have a higher probability of being murdered or sent to prison, especially after the #Biden/Clinton 1994 crime bill

Ok.	My families life is potentially going to take a massive change in the next 24 hours, if not sooner.	All down to the hysteria regarding this #coronavirus .	200k case globally	8k deaths	The world melts.	Fucking stupidity on a grand scale.	Thanks a fucking lot you sheep....
You have got children crying their eyes out because they can't sit their GCSEs 	My niece doesn't want her predictive grades as she wanted to actually sit them.	Months she has been preparing herself	#fuckyou #covid19UK #schoolclosuresuk #coronavirus #pisstake
Social distancing? It's not halal, let's go out in thousands and protest. 		#coronavirus #coronavirusindia #StaySafeStayHome #COVID2019 #AntiCAAprotests
Another day of the shop being a quarter full, another day of people asking why, its going to be like groundhog day for a few weeks #coronavirus I'm going to try and start a different conversation today as I'm giving up the will to live
REMINDER: You‚Äôre more likely to be killed by a Clinton than the #CoronaVirus
From my one module in Epidemiology in University I think I'm well placed to give my advice on the current pandemic which is..		'Wipe your lip and get on with it.'		You may return to your duties.		#coronavirus #covid19UK #COVID19 #giveover
I'm a very reasonable and realistic person. I've looked at all the data and based on the reaction to this #COVID19 	Pandemic. 		The reaction is not adding up.	Not even close.
Quarter teen and chill ? ü•µü§ï	#coronavirus
Not normally a conspiratard, but can't help thinking the #coronavirus panic is a priming exercise for the shutdown of economic growth deemed necessary in order to "combat climate change". Either that or an extraordinary dovetailing of aims.People are taking this thing way too seriously it's getting out of control. #coronavirus #COVID19 #ChineseVirus
If I hear one more person start their press release/email/meeting with "it's business as usual" I might just lose it. 	I don't care where you are or what you do, nothing about this is "usual".		#covid19 #flattenthecurve #stayhome
I‚Äôm not at all worried about getting sick from this stupid #coronavirus but I am worried about businesses closing, events getting postponed, supplies running low and all these crazy changes that affecting everyone‚Äôs lives
The #pandemic is the panic , not the #coronavirus  #COVID19
Hi virus,	You will never be able to touch me 	#COVID19
Keep sanity in mind. Do not let the government take full control. People have to work. The government can not support us all. If they could they would already be doing it. We're in extremely dangerous waters. Be brave. Be American. #coronavirus
Think everyone just needs to sit back relax and say, Hakuna Matataü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #coronavirus
Fear of economic slow down due to corona virus supersedes all other major events like subprime crisis, note bandi, Greece and Brexit etc		Is there a real problem which market is trying to discount or its panic? Only time will tell.		#Markets #marketselloff #Covid19
This #COVID19 is gunna crash our economy &amp; civilization if it carries on for too long.		Those vulnerable should be isolated but everyone else needs to return to normality sooner rather than later
The world leaders probably couldn‚Äôt fulfill their vision 2020 promises so they created the #COVID19 ü¶† virus to distract the world from asking the tough questions that‚Äôll come sooner or later.
I refuse to panic about #coronavirus until it‚Äôs death count surpasses the Clinton‚Äôs
Instead of "#flatteningthecurve" and prolonging our misery, let's just "rip off the band-aid" and get this over with! Long term stressing of hospitals is worse than a short term spike. And it's killing the economy. #COVID19
You can literally create a flu by yourself just by thinking about it.. 		These spin doctors know all about the laws of attraction &amp; that's the weapon they are using against humans, an attack on their biology via consciousness information manipulation.	#COVID19	#CoronaVirusUpdateI'm I only one who isn't panicking an thinks this is all a bit much? Also check out the new powers the state has given itself of the back of the #CoronaCrisis #Covid_19 #coronavirus
Covid-19 i gonna leave more people bankrupt and dead from suicide (when people lose their job, savings, home) than actual deaths from the virus...		#COVID19 #Corona
My father is 67 years old and is still going to work every day! #realmvp #Covid_19
#coronavirus conspiracy theory:	- people of 70 years and older are the most exposed to be dead from #Corona 	- their children are 40-50 years old and these people vote	- if parents die, children are pissed off and no votes	- hence - fight #coronavirus!
The same guy who faked the moon landing must have produced the #Coronavirus hoax for the #Democrats because this shit is convincing as hell.
So..... is there more to this than ‚Äòthey‚Äôre‚Äô letting on? #coronavirus #CoronaCrisis
Stay in place orders in New York,California and now Illinois. What do they have in common ? Democratic states maybe? #MAGA #coronavirus #Illinois
Take the #coronavirus seriously, but don‚Äôt lose your mind over it. 		While some people are vulnerable to it, yes, 90% of people that catch it will make a recovery without a problem.#Covid_19 #QuaratineAndChill daily sanity check... 		Around the globe about 150,000 people died yesterday		In the past 24 hours about 1,350 people around the globe died of Coronavirus		Less than 50 of those were otherwise healthy		Please stop with the hoarding and hysterics ü§Ø
#hongkongflu was worse and the world got through it - we will get through this #Covid_19
In California it‚Äôs legal to give someone AIDS without them knowing, shit on the streets, steal from stores &amp; kill a baby but if you want to play a game of 5 on 5 basketball at the park your ass is going to jail. #Covid_19 #CoronaCrisis #Quaratine #MartialLaw #californiashutdown
I dunno if Dr. Fauci is a "deep state plant" and all, but I do know this... Have you ever tried to get a straight answer from your doctor?? They hedge, and then they hedge the hedge. They are master hedgers, unwilling to be pinned down. üòÅ #ThankYouPresidentTrump #COVID19
I don't wish to appear flippant but as it stands I'm genuinely at more risk from gout than #Covid_19 . #SocialDistancing

I will never take your pills and I will never take your vaccines.   #Covid19
#Coronavirus #Covid19 #Covid_19 is a #scam. Why?	Most deaths are old people and with pre-diseases (cancer, hypertension,...etc) which can all cause death.	Death rates are inflated bcos of the detection sample driven by old people who visit hospitals regulary vs young ones.
If I DONT get #coronavirus after ALLLLLL this bullshit, ima be mad afI think the electric waves are the reason.üòÜ	#Covid_19 #physics
I wonder if #COVID19 discriminates? Just bc I'm not 65 or barely breathing I can't get tested. Great job American doctors. I'll just continue going to work and try to act like I don't feel like absolute shit.
It‚Äôs with profound respect for anyone who‚Äôs lost someone already, (and anyone who will lose someone) I say‚Äî		society‚Äôs cure may wind up being worse than the disease ...	#coronavirus #Covid_19
Don't get me wrong. #COVID19 is serious. 15,328 dead globally.		However, there are more homicides per year in the U.S. alone -- and "flattening the curve" doesn't apply to murder. (1/3)		#coronavirus #COVID„Éº19
In the end this virus will kill more businesses than people. #coronavirus #hysteria #factsWtf (what the flip) is this whole #coronavirus thing and why did it happen here
This #Covid19usa #Coronavirus propaganda is too much!
I‚Äôm thinking how did we get here? #COVID19 is brining the world to it‚Äôs knees and sinking it to a financial depression. I say it‚Äôs the news media with its fear mongering, promotion of hysteria, and their hatred of #realDonaldTrump
Yall want me to preach "We over Me" now? But when black people are shot my police officers its "oh well lol" when poor people are kicked out on the street because they cant pay bills its "lol get a better job" nah fuck your elderly and fuck your fear. #Coronavirus
It‚Äôs no surprise that when the republicans need a distraction for their bullshit that trump says the dumbest Shit ever. #sideshow #ropeadope #distraction #coronavirus #letsOpenUpTheEconomy #DumbAssTrumpHumans are house arrested  by #Coronavirus		its a republic day for all other animals 		#CoronavirusLockdown 	#Valimai
Here's a truth you won't like.		This 'pandemic' isn't a real emergency.		It's a mild flu for 90% of people - most of who won't know they have it.		The biggest threat is the scum media whipping up hysteria.		#CoronavirusLockdown #COVIDIDIOTS #Covid19Out #21daysLockdown #COVID19
Less than 0.001% of the UK‚Äôs population has the #coronavirus
In the US, smoking kills more than 480k annually,  40k die in car accidents, 5Ok die from suicide, 80k die from diabetes, more than 50k died from flu last year.  We should take #Covid19 serious but we are losing our minds when the death rate will likely be under flu. Its 809 now.
please everyone stop consistently telling ppl to stay inside, its demeaning and creating the impression that you are better than me		I'd like to go to work &amp; get food 4 my family without the feeling of being judged by ppl behind curtains		#coronavirus	#StayHome

If the United States doesn‚Äôt start it‚Äôs economy back up within a week, it will be devastating. We are witnessing the deaths of our freedom, our free market and the dollar. Socialism is a worse virus than  #COVID19.
I‚Äôm still not seeing a pandemic. I do see a seasonal virus out break like every year.	Is this now going to be a yearly event? Shutdown 4 a couple months because people catch the flu &amp; die? Not to be harsh but the numbers are just not adding up.		#coronavirus #CoronavirusLockdown

Is there a cure for the flu? No theres a vaccine. If you get the vaccine and come across a person with the flu you are still going to get the flu. Same with the  #Coronavirus theres going to be ALOT of people who get it but i feel our immune systems need to beat it one its own.
All these attempts to control us and take our rights in the name of fighting #coronavirus will only awaken more people to their tyranny!  We Americans have never bowed to a disease or tyrants and we won‚Äôt start now!
