United States of America used to be the most powerful country on the planet.		Now no one can even get a fucking Covid19 test.		Fuck the entire Republican party and everyone who voted for them.		#TrumptheWorstPresidentEVER 	#COVID19If a vaccine for #COVID_19 was available, it would be a reasonable policy to try and vaccinate 60% of the population to create herd immunity. 	To simply allow 60% to contract the disease is not herd immunity it's a mass epidemic!

If Trump and co. Keep up this pace of in-action and refusal of affordable (free) testing/treatment for their citizens, id be more scared of people travelling to and from USA than anywhere else. Without the proper procedures the spread will continue exponentially.#COVID19

So I probably have #COVID19. I‚Äôve got a warm enough forehead that feels like a fever. I‚Äôve been coughing and sneezing like cray cray. My nose is still stuffed after sneezing. My chest feels like it‚Äôs compressed and hard to breathe in. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm better off at home. AMA

It's REALLY bothering me how folks are using #covid19 as an opportunity to completely DESTROY an entire group of people just because they belong to a certain political party. This goes for both sides of the aisle.		STOP IT.	PEOPLE ARE SICK, DYING, &amp; SUFFERING.  	WE CAN DO BETTER.
